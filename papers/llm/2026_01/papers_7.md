      Locating the files and functions requiring modification in large open-source software (OSS) repositories is challenging due to their scale and structural complexity. Existing large language model (LLM)-based methods typically treat this as a repository-level retrieval task and rely on multiple auxiliary tools, which overlook code execution logic and complicate model control. We propose RepoNavigator, an LLM agent equipped with a single execution-aware tool-jumping to the definition of an invoked symbol. This unified design reflects the actual flow of code execution while simplifying tool manipulation. RepoNavigator is trained end-to-end via Reinforcement Learning (RL) directly from a pretrained model, without any closed-source distillation. Experiments demonstrate that RL-trained RepoNavigator achieves state-of-the-art performance, with the 7B model outperforming 14B baselines, the 14B model surpassing 32B competitors, and even the 32B model exceeding closed-source models such as Claude-3.7. These results confirm that integrating a single, structurally grounded tool with RL training provides an efficient and scalable solution for repository-level issue localization.

      Evaluating LLMs' instruction-following ability in multi-topic dialogues is essential yet challenging. Existing benchmarks are limited to a fixed number of turns, susceptible to saturation and failing to account for users' interactive experience. In this work, we propose a novel framework featuring a three-layer tracking mechanism and a query synthesis agent to mimic sequential user behaviors. Grounded in Flow Theory, we introduce process-centric metrics and terminate a conversational evaluation only upon exhausting user patience. Leveraging this framework, we present EvolIF, an evolving benchmark covering 12 constraint groups. Our analysis reveals deficiencies in failure recovery and fine-grained instruction following, with performance stratification becoming evident as conversational depth increases. GPT-5 demonstrates the most sustained resilience, maintaining a 66.40% robustness score, outperforming Gemini-3-Pro by 5.59%, while other models lag behind. Data and code will be released at https://github.com/JiaQiSJTU/EvolIF.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Understanding the similarity between large language models (LLMs) and human brain activity is crucial for advancing both AI and cognitive neuroscience. In this study, we provide a multilinguistic, large-scale assessment of this similarity by systematically comparing 16 publicly available pretrained LLMs with human brain responses during natural language processing tasks in both English and Chinese. Specifically, we use ridge regression to assess the representational similarity between LLM embeddings and electroencephalography (EEG) signals, and analyze the similarity between the "neural trajectory" and the "LLM latent trajectory." This method captures key dynamic patterns, such as magnitude, angle, uncertainty, and confidence. Our findings highlight both similarities and crucial differences in processing strategies: (1) We show that middle-to-high layers of LLMs are central to semantic integration and correspond to the N400 component observed in EEG; (2) The brain exhibits continuous and iterative processing during reading, whereas LLMs often show discrete, stage-end bursts of activity, which suggests a stark contrast in their real-time semantic processing dynamics. This study could offer new insights into LLMs and neural processing, and also establish a critical framework for future investigations into the alignment between artificial intelligence and biological intelligence.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      The increasing multimodal disinformation, where deceptive claims are reinforced through coordinated text and visual content, poses significant challenges to automated fact-checking. Recent efforts leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for this task, capitalizing on their strong reasoning and multimodal understanding capabilities. Emerging retrieval-augmented frameworks further equip LLMs with access to open-domain external information, enabling evidence-based verification beyond their internal knowledge. Despite their promising gains, our empirical study reveals notable shortcomings in the external search coverage and evidence quality evaluation. To mitigate those limitations, we propose Aletheia, an end-to-end framework for automated multimodal fact-checking. It introduces a novel evidence retrieval strategy that improves evidence coverage and filters useless information from open-domain sources, enabling the extraction of high-quality evidence for verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Aletheia achieves an accuracy of 88.3% on two public multimodal disinformation datasets and 90.2% on newly emerging claims. Compared with existing evidence retrieval strategies, our approach improves verification accuracy by up to 30.8%, highlighting the critical role of evidence quality in LLM-based disinformation verification.

      Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a central component of large language model (LLM) post-training. Unlike supervised fine-tuning (SFT), RLVR lets an LLM generate multiple candidate solutions and reinforces those that lead to a verifiably correct final answer. However, in practice, RLVR often requires thousands of training steps to reach strong performance, incurring substantial computation largely attributed to prolonged exploration. In this work, we make a surprising observation: during RLVR, LLMs evolve in a strongly linear manner. Specifically, both model weights and model output log-probabilities exhibit strong linear correlations with RL training steps. This suggests that RLVR predominantly amplifies trends that emerge early in training, rather than continuously discovering new behaviors throughout the entire optimization trajectory. Motivated by this linearity, we investigate whether future model states can be predicted from intermediate checkpoints via extrapolation, avoiding continued expensive training. We show that Weight Extrapolation produces models with performance comparable to standard RL training while requiring significantly less computation. Moreover, Logits Extrapolation consistently outperforms continued RL training on all four benchmarks by extrapolating beyond the step range where RL training remains stable.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Community Notes, the crowd-sourced misinformation governance system on X (formerly Twitter), allows users to flag misleading posts, attach contextual notes, and rate the notes' helpfulness. However, our empirical analysis of 30.8K health-related notes reveals substantial latency, with a median delay of 17.6 hours before notes receive a helpfulness status. To improve responsiveness during real-world misinformation surges, we propose CrowdNotes+, a unified LLM-based framework that augments Community Notes for faster and more reliable health misinformation governance. CrowdNotes+ integrates two modes: (1) evidence-grounded note augmentation and (2) utility-guided note automation, supported by a hierarchical three-stage evaluation of relevance, correctness, and helpfulness. We instantiate the framework with HealthNotes, a benchmark of 1.2K health notes annotated for helpfulness, and a fine-tuned helpfulness judge. Our analysis first uncovers a key loophole in current crowd-sourced governance: voters frequently conflate stylistic fluency with factual accuracy. Addressing this via our hierarchical evaluation, experiments across 15 representative LLMs demonstrate that CrowdNotes+ significantly outperforms human contributors in note correctness, helpfulness, and evidence utility.

      Generating accurate circuit schematics from high-level natural language descriptions remains a persistent challenge in electronics design, as large language models (LLMs) frequently hallucinate in granular details, violate electrical constraints, and produce non-machine-readable outputs. We present CircuitLM, a novel multi-agent LLM-aided circuit design pipeline that translates user prompts into structured, visually interpretable CircuitJSON schematics through five sequential stages: (i) LLM-based component identification, (ii) canonical pinout retrieval, (iii) chain-of-thought reasoning by an electronics expert agent, (iv) JSON schematic synthesis, and (v) force-directed SVG visualization. Anchored by a curated, embedding-powered component knowledge base. While LLMs often violate electrical constraints, CircuitLM bridges this gap by grounding generation in a verified and dynamically extensible component database, initially comprising 50 components. To ensure safety, we incorporate a hybrid evaluation framework, namely Dual-Metric Circuit Validation (DMCV), validated against human-expert assessments, which achieves high fidelity in microcontroller-centric designs. We evaluate the system on 100 diverse embedded-systems prompts across six LLMs and introduce DMCV to assess both structural and electrical validity. This work bridges natural language input to deployable hardware designs, enabling reliable circuit prototyping by non-experts. Our code and data will be made public upon acceptance.

      Personalized nutrition management aims to tailor dietary guidance to an individual's intake and phenotype, but most existing systems handle food logging, nutrient analysis and recommendation separately. We present a next-generation mobile nutrition assistant that combines image based meal logging with an LLM driven multi agent controller to provide meal level closed loop support. The system coordinates vision, dialogue and state management agents to estimate nutrients from photos and update a daily intake budget. It then adapts the next meal plan to user preferences and dietary constraints. Experiments with SNAPMe meal images and simulated users show competitive nutrient estimation, personalized menus and efficient task plans. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of multi agent LLM control for personalized nutrition and reveal open challenges in micronutrient estimation from images and in large scale real world studies.

      Large language models (LLMs) have precipitated a dramatic improvement in the legal domain, yet the deployment of standalone models faces significant limitations regarding hallucination, outdated information, and verifiability. Recently, LLM agents have attracted significant attention as a solution to these challenges, utilizing advanced capabilities such as planning, memory, and tool usage to meet the rigorous standards of legal practice. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of LLM agents for legal tasks, analyzing how these architectures bridge the gap between technical capabilities and domain-specific needs. Our major contributions include: (1) systematically analyzing the technical transition from standard legal LLMs to legal agents; (2) presenting a structured taxonomy of current agent applications across distinct legal practice areas; (3) discussing evaluation methodologies specifically for agentic performance in law; and (4) identifying open challenges and outlining future directions for developing robust and autonomous legal assistants.

      Machine unlearning aims to selectively remove the influence of specific training samples to satisfy privacy regulations such as the GDPR's 'Right to be Forgotten'. However, many existing methods require access to the data being removed, exposing it to membership inference attacks and potential misuse of Personally Identifiable Information (PII). We address this critical challenge by proposing Shadow Unlearning, a novel paradigm of approximate unlearning, that performs machine unlearning on anonymized forget data without exposing PII. We further propose a novel privacy-preserving framework, Neuro-Semantic Projector Unlearning (NSPU) to achieve Shadow unlearning. To evaluate our method, we compile Multi-domain Fictitious Unlearning (MuFU) forget set across five diverse domains and introduce an evaluation stack to quantify the trade-off between knowledge retention and unlearning effectiveness. Experimental results on various LLMs show that NSPU achieves superior unlearning performance, preserves model utility, and enhances user privacy. Additionally, the proposed approach is at least 10 times more computationally efficient than standard unlearning approaches. Our findings foster a new direction for privacy-aware machine unlearning that balances data protection and model fidelity.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) systems have emerged as powerful architectures for complex task decomposition and collaborative problem-solving. However, their long-term behavioral stability remains largely unexamined. This study introduces the concept of agent drift, defined as the progressive degradation of agent behavior, decision quality, and inter-agent coherence over extended interaction sequences. We present a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding drift phenomena, proposing three distinct manifestations: semantic drift (progressive deviation from original intent), coordination drift (breakdown in multi-agent consensus mechanisms), and behavioral drift (emergence of unintended strategies). We introduce the Agent Stability Index (ASI), a novel composite metric framework for quantifying drift across twelve dimensions, including response consistency, tool usage patterns, reasoning pathway stability, and inter-agent agreement rates. Through simulation-based analysis and theoretical modeling, we demonstrate how unchecked agent drift can lead to substantial reductions in task completion accuracy and increased human intervention requirements. We propose three mitigation strategies: episodic memory consolidation, drift-aware routing protocols, and adaptive behavioral anchoring. Theoretical analysis suggests these approaches can significantly reduce drift-related errors while maintaining system throughput. This work establishes a foundational methodology for monitoring, measuring, and mitigating agent drift in production agentic AI systems, with direct implications for enterprise deployment reliability and AI safety research.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Reinforcement learning (RL) is a framework for solving sequential decision-making problems. In this work, we demonstrate that, surprisingly, RL emerges during the inference time of large language models (LLMs), a phenomenon we term in-context RL (ICRL). To reveal this capability, we introduce a simple multi-round prompting framework, we call ICRL prompting, for inference-time self-improvement. The goal of ICRL prompting is to guide LLMs to perform reinforcement learning during inference for self-improvement on a given task. After each response, the model receives numerical scalar feedback, denoted as a reward. In the next round, we prompt the LLM again together with a context that concatenates all prior responses and their associated rewards. We consistently observe that response quality improves as the context grows. In other words, the LLM can optimize scalar reward signals during inference, exhibiting behavior analogous to reinforcement learning. We evaluate ICRL prompting on Game of 24, creative writing, ScienceWorld, and Olympiad-level math competitions (AIME and HMMT), demonstrating significant improvements over baselines such as Self-Refine and Reflexion. Notably, even when the reward signals are generated by the same LLM, ICRL prompting still improves performance, highlighting a promising new paradigm for test-time scaling.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Recently, people have suffered and become increasingly aware of the unreliability gap in LLMs for open and knowledge-intensive tasks, and thus turn to search-augmented LLMs to mitigate this issue. However, when the search engine is triggered for harmful tasks, the outcome is no longer under the LLM's control. Once the returned content directly contains targeted, ready-to-use harmful takeaways, the LLM's safeguards cannot withdraw that exposure. Motivated by this dilemma, we identify web search as a critical attack surface and propose \textbf{\textit{SearchAttack}} for red-teaming. SearchAttack outsources the harmful semantics to web search, retaining only the query's skeleton and fragmented clues, and further steers LLMs to reconstruct the retrieved content via structural rubrics to achieve malicious goals. Extensive experiments are conducted to red-team the search-augmented LLMs for responsible vulnerability assessment. Empirically, SearchAttack demonstrates strong effectiveness in attacking these systems.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      To mitigate hallucinations in large language models (LLMs), we propose a framework that focuses on errors induced by prompts. Our method extends a chain-style knowledge distillation approach by incorporating a programmable module that guides knowledge graph exploration. This module is embedded as executable code within the reasoning prompt, allowing the model to leverage external structured knowledge during inference. Based on this design, we develop an enhanced distillation-based reasoning framework that explicitly regulates intermediate reasoning steps, resulting in more reliable predictions. We evaluate the proposed approach on multiple public benchmarks using GPT-4 and LLaMA-3.3. Experimental results show that code-guided reasoning significantly improves contextual modeling and reduces prompt-induced hallucinations. Specifically, HIT@1, HIT@3, and HIT@5 increase by 15.64%, 13.38%, and 13.28%, respectively, with scores exceeding 95% across several evaluation settings. These findings indicate that the proposed method effectively constrains erroneous reasoning while improving both accuracy and interpretability.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted for tasks like drafting emails, summarizing meetings, and answering health questions. In these settings, users may need to share private information (e.g., contact details, health records). To evaluate LLMs' ability to identify and redact such information, prior work introduced real-life, scenario-based benchmarks (e.g., ConfAIde, PrivacyLens) and found that LLMs can leak private information in complex scenarios. However, these evaluations relied on proxy LLMs to judge the helpfulness and privacy-preservation quality of LLM responses, rather than directly measuring users' perceptions. To understand how users perceive the helpfulness and privacy-preservation quality of LLM responses to privacy-sensitive scenarios, we conducted a user study ($n=94$) using 90 PrivacyLens scenarios. We found that users had low agreement with each other when evaluating identical LLM responses. In contrast, five proxy LLMs reached high agreement, yet each proxy LLM had low correlation with users' evaluations. These results indicate that proxy LLMs cannot accurately estimate users' wide range of perceptions of utility and privacy in privacy-sensitive scenarios. We discuss the need for more user-centered studies to measure LLMs' ability to help users while preserving privacy, and for improving alignment between LLMs and users in estimating perceived privacy and utility.

      As large language model (LLM) assistants become increasingly integrated into enterprise workflows, their ability to generate accurate, semantically aligned, and executable outputs is critical. However, current conversational business analytics (CBA) systems often lack built-in verification mechanisms, leaving users to manually validate potentially flawed results. This paper introduces two complementary verification techniques: Q*, which performs reverse translation and semantic matching between code and user intent, and Feedback+, which incorporates execution feedback to guide code refinement. Embedded within a generator-discriminator framework, these mechanisms shift validation responsibilities from users to the system. Evaluations on three benchmark datasets, Spider, Bird, and GSM8K, demonstrate that both Q* and Feedback+ reduce error rates and task completion time. The study also identifies reverse translation as a key bottleneck, highlighting opportunities for future improvement. Overall, this work contributes a design-oriented framework for building more reliable, enterprise-grade GenAI systems capable of trustworthy decision support.

We conduct extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks spanning mathematics, reasoning, and knowledge domains, evaluating 11 LLMs across four model families. Our analysis reveals significant quality variations among existing benchmarks and demonstrates that selective benchmark construction based on our metrics can achieve comparable evaluation performance with substantially reduced test sets.

      Recent advancements in Large Language Models have successfully transitioned towards System 2 reasoning, yet applying these paradigms to video understanding remains challenging. While prevailing research attributes failures in Video-LLMs to perceptual limitations, our empirical analysis reveals a cognitive misalignment termed Semantic Inertia, where models suppress valid visual evidence in favor of dominant language priors. To rectify this, we propose VISTA, a training-free framework designed to align perception with logical deduction. By dynamically routing inference paths and materializing implicit visual features into explicit textual anchors, our approach effectively counterbalances the influence of parametric knowledge. Furthermore, we incorporate a Latent Reasoning Consensus mechanism to mitigate stochastic hallucinations. VISTA showed outstanding results on a wide range of benchmarks, and outperforms its base model by 9.3% on Egochema and 5.6% on VideoEspresso, rivalling or even surpassing larger and proprietary models.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into software development workflows, yet their behavior in structured, specification-driven processes remains poorly understood. This paper presents an empirical study design using CURRANTE, a Visual Studio Code extension that enables a human-in-the-loop workflow for LLM-assisted code generation. The tool guides developers through three sequential stages--Specification, Tests, and Function--allowing them to define requirements, generate and refine test suites, and produce functions that satisfy those tests. Participants will solve medium-difficulty problems from the LiveCodeBench dataset, while the tool records fine-grained interaction logs, effectiveness metrics (e.g., pass rate, all-pass completion), efficiency indicators (e.g., time-to-pass), and iteration behaviors. The study aims to analyze how human intervention in specification and test refinement influences the quality and dynamics of LLM-generated code. The results will provide empirical insights into the design of next-generation development environments that align human reasoning with model-driven code generation.

      Prior works have shown that fine-tuning on new knowledge can induce factual hallucinations in large language models (LLMs), leading to incorrect outputs when evaluated on previously known information. However, the specific manifestations of such hallucination and its underlying mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. Our work addresses this gap by designing a controlled dataset \textit{Biography-Reasoning}, and conducting a fine-grained analysis across multiple knowledge types and two task types, including knowledge question answering (QA) and knowledge reasoning tasks. We find that hallucinations not only severely affect tasks involving newly introduced knowledge, but also propagate to other evaluation tasks. Moreover, when fine-tuning on a dataset in which a specific knowledge type consists entirely of new knowledge, LLMs exhibit elevated hallucination tendencies. This suggests that the degree of unfamiliarity within a particular knowledge type, rather than the overall proportion of new knowledge, is a stronger driver of hallucinations. Through interpretability analysis, we show that learning new knowledge weakens the model's attention to key entities in the input question, leading to an over-reliance on surrounding context and a higher risk of hallucination. Conversely, reintroducing a small amount of known knowledge during the later stages of training restores attention to key entities and substantially mitigates hallucination behavior. Finally, we demonstrate that disrupted attention patterns can propagate across lexically similar contexts, facilitating the spread of hallucinations beyond the original task.

Especially, we apply Adversarial Context Alignment to purge semantic inconsistencies and use NTP (a type of harmful prompt) -based few-shot examples to guide malicious outputs, lastly forming DH-CoT attack with a fake chain of thought. In experiments, we further observe that existing red-teaming datasets include samples unsuitable for evaluating attack gains, such as BPs, NHPs, and NTPs. Such data hinders accurate evaluation of true attack effect lifts. To address this, we introduce MDH, a Malicious content Detection framework integrating LLM-based annotation with Human assistance, with which we clean data and build RTA dataset suite. Experiments show that MDH reliably filters low-quality samples and that DH-CoT effectively jailbreaks models including GPT-5 and Claude-4, notably outperforming SOTA methods like H-CoT and TAP.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Continual Pre-Training (CPT) is widely used for acquiring and updating factual knowledge in LLMs. This practice treats loss as a proxy for knowledge learning, while offering no grounding into how it changes during training. We study CPT as a knowledge learning process rather than a solely optimization problem. We construct a controlled, distribution-matched benchmark of factual documents and interleave diagnostic probes directly into the CPT loop, enabling epoch-level measurement of knowledge acquisition dynamics and changes in Out-Of-Domain (OOD) general skills (e.g., math). We further analyze how CPT reshapes knowledge circuits during training. Across three instruction-tuned LLMs and multiple CPT strategies, optimization and learning systematically diverge as loss decreases monotonically while factual learning is unstable and non-monotonic. Acquired facts are rarely consolidated, learning is strongly conditioned on prior exposure, and OOD performance degrades from early epochs. Circuit analysis reveals rapid reconfiguration of knowledge pathways across epochs, providing an explanation for narrow acquisition windows and systematic forgetting. These results show that loss optimization is misaligned with learning progress in CPT and motivate evaluation of stopping criteria based on task-level learning dynamics.

      LLMs are increasingly used to boost productivity and support software engineering tasks. However, when applied to socially sensitive decisions such as team composition and task allocation, they raise concerns of fairness. Prior studies have revealed that LLMs may reproduce stereotypes; however, these analyses remain exploratory and examine sensitive attributes in isolation. This study investigates whether LLMs exhibit bias in team composition and task assignment by analyzing the combined effects of candidates' country and pronouns. Using three LLMs and 3,000 simulated decisions, we find systematic disparities: demographic attributes significantly shaped both selection likelihood and task allocation, even when accounting for expertise-related factors. Task distributions further reflected stereotypes, with technical and leadership roles unevenly assigned across groups. Our findings indicate that LLMs exacerbate demographic inequities in software engineering contexts, underscoring the need for fairness-aware assessment.

While existing work has largely focused on individual agents or on interacting agents sharing explicit communication, less is known about how interacting agents coordinate implicitly. In particular, agents may engage in covert communication, relying on indirect or non-linguistic signals embedded in their actions rather than on explicit messages. This paper presents a game-theoretic study of covert communication in LLM-driven multi-agent systems. We analyse interactions across four canonical game-theoretic settings under different communication regimes, including explicit, restricted, and absent communication. Considering heterogeneous agent personalities and both one-shot and repeated games, we characterise when covert signals emerge and how they shape coordination and strategic outcomes.

      A recent approach to neurosymbolic reasoning is to explicitly combine the strengths of large language models (LLMs) and symbolic solvers to tackle complex reasoning tasks. However, current approaches face significant limitations, including poor generalizability due to task-specific prompts, inefficiencies caused by the lack of separation between knowledge and queries, and restricted inferential capabilities. These shortcomings hinder their scalability and applicability across diverse domains. In this paper, we introduce VERUS-LM, a novel framework designed to address these challenges. VERUS-LM employs a generic prompting mechanism, clearly separates domain knowledge from queries, and supports a wide range of different logical reasoning tasks. This framework enhances adaptability, reduces computational cost, and allows for richer forms of reasoning, such as optimization and constraint satisfaction. We show that our approach succeeds in diverse reasoning on a novel dataset, markedly outperforming LLMs. Additionally, our system achieves competitive results on common reasoning benchmarks when compared to similar state-of-the-art approaches, and significantly surpasses them on the difficult AR-LSAT dataset. By pushing the boundaries of hybrid reasoning, VERUS-LM represents a significant step towards more versatile neurosymbolic AI systems.

      Precisely controlling the length of generated text is a common requirement in real-world applications. However, despite significant advancements in following human instructions, Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggle with this task. In this work, we demonstrate that LLMs often fail to accurately measure their response lengths, leading to poor adherence to length constraints. To address this issue, we propose a novel length regulation approach that incorporates dynamic length feedback during generation, enabling adaptive adjustments to meet target lengths. Experiments on summarization and biography tasks show our training-free approach significantly improves precision in achieving target token, word, or sentence counts without compromising quality. Additionally, we demonstrate that further supervised fine-tuning allows our method to generalize effectively to broader text-generation tasks.

      Large language models (LLMs) have achieved notable performance in code synthesis; however, data-aware augmentation remains a limiting factor, handled via heuristic design or brute-force approaches. We introduce a performance-aware, closed-loop solution in the NNGPT ecosystem of projects that enables LLMs to autonomously engineer optimal transformations by internalizing empirical performance cues. We fine-tune LLMs with Low-Rank Adaptation on a novel repository of more than 6,000 empirically evaluated PyTorch augmentation functions, each annotated solely by downstream model accuracy. Training uses pairwise performance ordering (better-worse transformations), enabling alignment through empirical feedback without reinforcement learning, reward models, or symbolic objectives. This reduces the need for exhaustive search, achieving up to 600x times fewer evaluated candidates than brute-force discovery while maintaining competitive peak accuracy and shifting generation from random synthesis to task-aligned design. Ablation studies show that structured Chain-of-Thought prompting introduces syntactic noise and degrades performance, whereas direct prompting ensures stable optimization in performance-critical code tasks. Qualitative and quantitative analyses demonstrate that the model internalizes semantic performance cues rather than memorizing syntax. These results show that LLMs can exhibit task-level reasoning through non-textual feedback loops, bypassing explicit symbolic rewards.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have been reported to "leak" Personally Identifiable Information (PII), with successful PII reconstruction often interpreted as evidence of memorization. We propose a principled revision of memorization evaluation for LLMs, arguing that PII leakage should be evaluated under low lexical cue conditions, where target PII cannot be reconstructed through prompt-induced generalization or pattern completion. We formalize Cue-Resistant Memorization (CRM) as a cue-controlled evaluation framework and a necessary condition for valid memorization evaluation, explicitly conditioning on prompt-target overlap cues. Using CRM, we conduct a large-scale multilingual re-evaluation of PII leakage across 32 languages and multiple memorization paradigms. Revisiting reconstruction-based settings, including verbatim prefix-suffix completion and associative reconstruction, we find that their apparent effectiveness is driven primarily by direct surface-form cues rather than by true memorization. When such cues are controlled for, reconstruction success diminishes substantially. We further examine cue-free generation and membership inference, both of which exhibit extremely low true positive rates. Overall, our results suggest that previously reported PII leakage is better explained by cue-driven behavior than by genuine memorization, highlighting the importance of cue-controlled evaluation for reliably quantifying privacy-relevant memorization in LLMs.

      Human-agent dialogues often exhibit topic continuity-a stable thematic frame that evolves through temporally adjacent exchanges-yet most large language model (LLM) agent memory systems fail to preserve it. Existing designs follow a fragmentation-compensation paradigm: they first break dialogue streams into isolated utterances for storage, then attempt to restore coherence via embedding-based retrieval. This process irreversibly damages narrative and causal flow, while biasing retrieval towards lexical similarity. We introduce membox, a hierarchical memory architecture centered on a Topic Loom that continuously monitors dialogue in a sliding-window fashion, grouping consecutive same-topic turns into coherent "memory boxes" at storage time. Sealed boxes are then linked by a Trace Weaver into long-range event-timeline traces, recovering macro-topic recurrences across discontinuities. Experiments on LoCoMo demonstrate that Membox achieves up to 68% F1 improvement on temporal reasoning tasks, outperforming competitive baselines (e.g., Mem0, A-MEM). Notably, Membox attains these gains while using only a fraction of the context tokens required by existing methods, highlighting a superior balance between efficiency and effectiveness. By explicitly modeling topic continuity, Membox offers a cognitively motivated mechanism for enhancing both coherence and efficiency in LLM agents.

      Although existing model editing methods perform well in recalling exact edit facts, they often struggle in complex scenarios that require deeper semantic understanding rather than mere knowledge regurgitation. Leveraging the strong contextual reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), in-context learning (ICL) becomes a promising editing method by comprehending edit information through context encoding. However, this method is constrained by the limited context window of LLMs, leading to degraded performance and efficiency as the number of edits increases. To overcome this limitation, we propose InComeS, a flexible framework that enhances LLMs' ability to process editing contexts through explicit compression and selection mechanisms. Specifically, InComeS compresses each editing context into the key-value (KV) cache of a special gist token, enabling efficient handling of multiple edits without being restricted by the model's context window. Furthermore, specialized cross-attention modules are added to dynamically select the most relevant information from the gist pools, enabling adaptive and effective utilization of edit information. We conduct experiments on diverse model editing benchmarks with various editing formats, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.

      We explore the intrinsic dimension (ID) of LLM representations as a marker of linguistic complexity, asking if different ID profiles across LLM layers differentially characterize formal and functional complexity. We find the formal contrast between sentences with multiple coordinated or subordinated clauses to be reflected in ID differences whose onset aligns with a phase of more abstract linguistic processing independently identified in earlier work. The functional contrasts between sentences characterized by right branching vs. center embedding or unambiguous vs. ambiguous relative clause attachment are also picked up by ID, but in a less marked way, and they do not correlate with the same processing phase. Further experiments using representational similarity and layer ablation confirm the same trends. We conclude that ID is a useful marker of linguistic complexity in LLMs, that it allows to differentiate between different types of complexity, and that it points to similar stages of linguistic processing across disparate LLMs.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) can produce verbalized self-explanations, yet prior studies suggest that such rationales may not reliably reflect the model's true decision process. We ask whether these explanations nevertheless help users predict model behavior, operationalized as counterfactual simulatability. Using StrategyQA, we evaluate how well humans and LLM judges can predict a model's answers to counterfactual follow-up questions, with and without access to the model's chain-of-thought or post-hoc explanations. We compare LLM-generated counterfactuals with pragmatics-based perturbations as alternative ways to construct test cases for assessing the potential usefulness of explanations. Our results show that self-explanations consistently improve simulation accuracy for both LLM judges and humans, but the degree and stability of gains depend strongly on the perturbation strategy and judge strength. We also conduct a qualitative analysis of free-text justifications written by human users when predicting the model's behavior, which provides evidence that access to explanations helps humans form more accurate predictions on the perturbed questions.

      As large language models (LLMs) are more frequently used in retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, it is increasingly relevant to study their behavior under knowledge conflicts. Thus far, the role of the source of the retrieved information has gone unexamined. We address this gap with a novel framework to investigate how source preferences affect LLM resolution of inter-context knowledge conflicts in English, motivated by interdisciplinary research on credibility. With a comprehensive, tightly-controlled evaluation of 13 open-weight LLMs, we find that LLMs prefer institutionally-corroborated information (e.g., government or newspaper sources) over information from people and social media. However, these source preferences can be reversed by simply repeating information from less credible sources. To mitigate repetition effects and maintain consistent preferences, we propose a novel method that reduces repetition bias by up to 99.8%, while also maintaining at least 88.8% of original preferences. We release all data and code to encourage future work on credibility and source preferences in knowledge-intensive NLP.

      The original CLIP text encoder is limited by a maximum input length of 77 tokens, which hampers its ability to effectively process long texts and perform fine-grained semantic understanding. In addition, the CLIP text encoder lacks support for multilingual inputs. All these limitations significantly restrict its applicability across a broader range of tasks. Recent studies have attempted to replace the CLIP text encoder with an LLM-based embedder to enhance its ability in processing long texts, multilingual understanding, and fine-grained semantic comprehension. However, because the representation spaces of LLMs and the vision-language space of CLIP are pretrained independently without alignment priors, direct alignment using contrastive learning can disrupt the intrinsic vision-language alignment in the CLIP image encoder, leading to an underutilization of the knowledge acquired during pre-training. To address this challenge, we propose ProCLIP, a curriculum learning-based progressive vision-language alignment framework to effectively align the CLIP image encoder with an LLM-based embedder. Specifically, ProCLIP first distills knowledge from CLIP's text encoder into the LLM-based embedder to leverage CLIP's rich pretrained knowledge while establishing initial alignment between the LLM embedder and CLIP image encoder. Subsequently, ProCLIP further aligns the CLIP image encoder with the LLM-based embedder through image-text contrastive tuning, employing self-distillation regularization to avoid overfitting. To achieve a more effective alignment, instance semantic alignment loss and embedding structure alignment loss are employed during representation inheritance and contrastive tuning.

      Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) improves performance but introduces critical safety vulnerabilities: even minimal harmful data can severely compromise safety measures. We observe that perturbations orthogonal to the alignment direction - defined by weight differences between aligned (safe) and unaligned models - rapidly compromise model safety. In contrast, updates along the alignment direction largely preserve it, revealing the parameter space as a "narrow safety basin". To address this, we propose AsFT (Anchoring Safety in Fine-Tuning) to maintain safety by explicitly constraining update directions during fine-tuning. By penalizing updates orthogonal to the alignment direction, AsFT effectively constrains the model within the "narrow safety basin," thus preserving its inherent safety. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and models show that AsFT reduces harmful behaviors by up to 7.60%, improves task performance by 3.44%, and consistently outperforms existing methods across multiple tasks.

      The screenplay serves as the foundation for television production, defining narrative structure, character development, and dialogue. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show great potential in creative writing, direct end-to-end generation approaches often fail to produce well-crafted screenplays. We argue this failure stems from forcing a single model to simultaneously master two disparate capabilities: creative narrative construction and rigid format adherence. The resulting outputs may mimic superficial style but lack the deep structural integrity and storytelling substance required for professional use. To enable LLMs to generate high-quality screenplays, we introduce Dual-Stage Refinement (DSR), a decomposed framework that decouples creative narrative generation from format conversion. The first stage transforms a brief outline into rich, novel-style prose. The second stage refines this narrative into a professionally formatted screenplay. This separation enables the model to specialize in one distinct capability at each stage. A key challenge in implementing DSR is the scarcity of paired outline-to-novel training data. We address this through hybrid data synthesis: reverse synthesis deconstructs existing screenplays into structured inputs, while forward synthesis leverages these inputs to generate high-quality narrative texts as training targets. Blind evaluations by professional screenwriters show that DSR achieves a 75% win rate against strong baselines like Gemini-2.5-Pro and reaches 82.7% of human-level performance. Our work demonstrates that decomposed generation architecture with tailored data synthesis effectively specializes LLMs in complex creative domains.

      Personalized medication planning involves selecting medications and determining a dosing schedule to achieve medical goals specific to each individual patient. Previous work successfully demonstrated that automated planners, using general domain-independent heuristics, are able to generate personalized treatments, when the domain and problems are modeled using a general domain description language (\pddlp). Unfortunately, this process was limited in practice to consider no more than seven medications. In clinical terms, this is a non-starter. In this paper, we explore the use of automatically-generated domain- and problem-specific heuristics to be used with general search, as a method of scaling up medication planning to levels allowing closer work with clinicians. Specifically, we specify the domain programmatically (specifying an initial state and a successor generation procedure), and use an LLM to generate a problem specific heuristic that can be used by a fixed search algorithm (GBFS). The results indicate dramatic improvements in coverage and planning time, scaling up the number of medications to at least 28, and bringing medication planning one step closer to practical applications.

      Recent studies reveal that large language models (LLMs) exhibit limited logical reasoning abilities in mathematical problem-solving, instead often relying on pattern-matching and memorization. We systematically analyze this limitation, focusing on logical relationship understanding, which is a core capability underlying genuine logical reasoning, and reveal that errors related to this capability account for over 90\% of incorrect predictions, with Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-Tuning (CoT-SFT) failing to substantially reduce these errors. To address this bottleneck, we propose First-Step Logical Reasoning (FSLR), a lightweight training framework targeting logical relationship understanding. Our key insight is that the first planning step-identifying which variables to use and which operation to apply-encourages the model to derive logical relationships directly from the problem statement. By training models on this isolated step, FSLR provides explicit supervision for logical relationship understanding, unlike CoT-SFT which implicitly embeds such relationships within complete solution trajectories. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that FSLR consistently outperforms CoT-SFT under both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, with average improvements of 3.2\% and 4.6\%, respectively. Moreover, FSLR achieves 4-6x faster training and reduces training token consumption by over 80\%.

STEPS explicitly targets compositional generalization by uncovering latent relationships among skills and organizing them into an interpretable, hierarchical skill taxonomy using structural information theory. Building on this taxonomy, we formulate data synthesis as a constrained information maximization problem, selecting skill combinations that maximize marginal structural information within the hierarchy while preserving semantic coherence. Experiments on challenging instruction-following benchmarks show that STEPS outperforms existing data synthesis baselines, while also yielding improved compositional generalization in downstream agent-based evaluations.

      We introduce TemporalVLM, a video large language model (video LLM) for temporal reasoning and fine-grained understanding in long videos. Our approach includes a visual encoder for mapping a long-term video into features which are time-aware and contain both local and global cues. It first divides an input video into short-term clips, which are jointly encoded with timestamps and fused across overlapping temporal windows into time-sensitive local features. Next, the local features are passed through a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) module for global feature aggregation. Moreover, to facilitate the evaluation of TemporalVLM, we present a large-scale long video dataset of industry assembly processes, namely IndustryASM, consisting of videos recorded on factory floors with actions and timestamps annotated by industrial engineers for time and motion studies and temporal action segmentation evaluation. Finally, extensive experiments show that TemporalVLM outperforms previous methods across temporal reasoning and fine-grained understanding tasks, i.e., dense video captioning, temporal video grounding, video highlight detection, and temporal action segmentation. To our best knowledge, our work is the first to incorporate LSTMs into video LLMs.

      Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities on numerous natural language processing tasks. However, LLMs still struggle with numerical question answering for financial documents that include tabular and textual data. Recent works have showed the effectiveness of critic agents (i.e., self-correction) for this task given oracle labels. Building upon this framework, this paper examines the effectiveness of the traditional critic agent when oracle labels are not available, and show, through experiments, that this critic agent's performance deteriorates in this scenario. With this in mind, we present an improved critic agent, along with the calculator agent which outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approach (program-of-thought) and is safer. Furthermore, we investigate how our agents interact with each other, and how this interaction affects their performance.

      Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning and decision-making by leveraging external tools. However, this tool-centric paradigm introduces a previously underexplored attack surface, where adversaries can manipulate tool metadata -- such as names, descriptions, and parameter schemas -- to influence agent behavior. We identify this as a new and stealthy threat surface that allows malicious tools to be preferentially selected by LLM agents, without requiring prompt injection or access to model internals. To demonstrate and exploit this vulnerability, we propose the Attractive Metadata Attack (AMA), a black-box in-context learning framework that generates highly attractive but syntactically and semantically valid tool metadata through iterative optimization. The proposed attack integrates seamlessly into standard tool ecosystems and requires no modification to the agent's execution framework. Extensive experiments across ten realistic, simulated tool-use scenarios and a range of popular LLM agents demonstrate consistently high attack success rates (81\%-95\%) and significant privacy leakage, with negligible impact on primary task execution. Moreover, the attack remains effective even against prompt-level defenses, auditor-based detection, and structured tool-selection protocols such as the Model Context Protocol, revealing systemic vulnerabilities in current agent architectures. These findings reveal that metadata manipulation constitutes a potent and stealthy attack surface. Notably, AMA is orthogonal to injection attacks and can be combined with them to achieve stronger attack efficacy, highlighting the need for execution-level defenses beyond prompt-level and auditor-based mechanisms.

      Cloud applications heavily rely on APIs to communicate with each other and exchange data. To ensure the reliability of cloud applications, cloud providers widely adopt API testing techniques. Unfortunately, existing API testing approaches are insufficient to reach strict conditions, a problem known as fitness plateaus, due to the lack of gradient provided by coverage metrics. To address this issue, we propose MioHint, a novel white-box API testing approach that leverages the code comprehension capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM) to boost API testing. The key challenge of LLM-based API testing lies in system-level testing, which emphasizes the dependencies between requests and targets across functions and files, thereby making the entire codebase the object of analysis. However, feeding the entire codebase to an LLM is impractical due to its limited context length and short memory. MioHint addresses this challenge by synergizing static analysis with LLMs. We retrieve relevant code with data-dependency analysis at the statement level, including def-use analysis for variables used in the target and function expansion for subfunctions called by the target. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted experiments across 16 real-world REST API services. The findings reveal that MioHint achieves an average increase of 4.95% absolute in line coverage compared to the baseline, EvoMaster, alongside a remarkable factor of 67x improvement in mutation accuracy. Furthermore, our method successfully covers over 57% of hard-to-cover targets while in baseline the coverage is less than 10%.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled dynamic reasoning in automated data analytics, yet recent multi-agent systems remain limited by rigid, single-path workflows that restrict strategic exploration and often lead to suboptimal outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose SPIO (Sequential Plan Integration and Optimization), a framework that replaces rigid workflows with adaptive, multi-path planning across four core modules: data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning. In each module, specialized agents generate diverse candidate strategies, which are cascaded and refined by an optimization agent. SPIO offers two operating modes: SPIO-S for selecting a single optimal pipeline, and SPIO-E for ensembling top-k pipelines to maximize robustness. Extensive evaluations on Kaggle and OpenML benchmarks show that SPIO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average performance gain of 5.6%. By explicitly exploring and integrating multiple solution paths, SPIO delivers a more flexible, accurate, and reliable foundation for automated data science.

      Emotional coordination is a core property of human interaction that shapes how relational meaning is constructed in real time. While text-based affect inference has become increasingly feasible, prior approaches often treat sentiment as a deterministic point estimate for individual speakers, failing to capture the inherent subjectivity, latent ambiguity, and sequential coupling found in mutual exchanges. We introduce LLM-MC-Affect, a probabilistic framework that characterizes emotion not as a static label, but as a continuous latent probability distribution defined over an affective space. By leveraging stochastic LLM decoding and Monte Carlo estimation, the methodology approximates these distributions to derive high-fidelity sentiment trajectories that explicitly quantify both central affective tendencies and perceptual ambiguity. These trajectories enable a structured analysis of interpersonal coupling through sequential cross-correlation and slope-based indicators, identifying leading or lagging influences between interlocutors. To validate the interpretive capacity of this approach, we utilize teacher-student instructional dialogues as a representative case study, where our quantitative indicators successfully distill high-level interaction insights such as effective scaffolding. This work establishes a scalable and deployable pathway for understanding interpersonal dynamics, offering a generalizable solution that extends beyond education to broader social and behavioral research.

      Many real-world software tasks require exact transcription of provided data into code, such as cryptographic constants, protocol test vectors, allowlists, and calibration tables. These tasks are operationally sensitive because small omissions or alterations can remain silent while producing syntactically valid programs. This paper introduces a deliberately minimal transcription-to-code benchmark to isolate this reliability concern in LLM-based code generation. Given a list of high-precision decimal constants, a model must generate Python code that embeds the constants verbatim and performs a simple aggregate computation. We describe the prompting variants, evaluation protocol based on exact-string inclusion, and analysis framework used to characterize state-tracking and long-horizon generation failures. The benchmark is intended as a compact stress test that complements existing code-generation evaluations by focusing on data integrity rather than algorithmic reasoning.

      Conversational human-likeness plays a central role in human-AI interaction, yet it has remained difficult to define, measure, and optimize. As a result, improvements in human-like behavior are largely driven by scale or broad supervised training, rather than targeted alignment. We introduce Human Aligning LLMs (HAL), a framework for aligning language models to conversational human-likeness using an interpretable, data-driven reward. HAL derives explicit conversational traits from contrastive dialogue data, combines them into a compact scalar score, and uses this score as a transparent reward signal for alignment with standard preference optimization methods. Using this approach, we align models of varying sizes without affecting their overall performance. In large-scale human evaluations, models aligned with HAL are more frequently perceived as human-like in conversation. Because HAL operates over explicit, interpretable traits, it enables inspection of alignment behavior and diagnosis of unintended effects. More broadly, HAL demonstrates how soft, qualitative properties of language--previously outside the scope for alignment--can be made measurable and aligned in an interpretable and explainable way.

      This paper presents the first systematic comparison investigating whether Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are superior judge to non-reasoning LLMs. Our empirical analysis yields four key findings: 1) LRMs outperform non-reasoning LLMs in terms of judgment accuracy, particularly on reasoning-intensive tasks; 2) LRMs demonstrate superior instruction-following capabilities in evaluation contexts; 3) LRMs exhibit enhanced robustness against adversarial attacks targeting judgment tasks; 4) However, LRMs still exhibit strong biases in superficial quality. To improve the robustness against biases, we propose PlanJudge, an evaluation strategy that prompts the model to generate an explicit evaluation plan before execution. Despite its simplicity, our experiments demonstrate that PlanJudge significantly mitigates biases in both LRMs and standard LLMs.

To address this, we introduce ChemCoTBench, a reasoning framework that bridges molecular structure understanding with arithmetic-inspired operations, including addition, deletion, and substitution, to formalize chemical problem-solving into transparent, step-by-step workflows. By treating molecular transformations as modular "chemical operations", the framework enables slow-thinking reasoning, mirroring the logic of mathematical proofs while grounding solutions in real-world chemical constraints. We evaluate models on two high-impact tasks: Molecular Property Optimization and Chemical Reaction Prediction. These tasks mirror real-world challenges while providing structured evaluability. By providing annotated datasets, a reasoning taxonomy, and baseline evaluations, ChemCoTBench bridges the gap between abstract reasoning methods and practical chemical discovery, establishing a foundation for advancing LLMs as tools for AI-driven scientific innovation.

      Despite rich safety alignment strategies, large language models (LLMs) remain highly susceptible to jailbreak attacks, which compromise safety guardrails and pose serious security risks. Existing detection methods mainly detect jailbreak status relying on jailbreak templates present in the training data. However, few studies address the more realistic and challenging zero-shot jailbreak detection setting, where no jailbreak templates are available during training. This setting better reflects real-world scenarios where new attacks continually emerge and evolve. To address this challenge, we propose a layer-wise, module-wise, and token-wise amplification framework that progressively magnifies internal feature discrepancies between benign and jailbreak prompts. We uncover safety-relevant layers, identify specific modules that inherently encode zero-shot discriminative signals, and localize informative safety tokens. Building upon these insights, we introduce ALERT (Amplification-based Jailbreak Detector), an efficient and effective zero-shot jailbreak detector that introduces two independent yet complementary classifiers on amplified representations. Extensive experiments on three safety benchmarks demonstrate that ALERT achieves consistently strong zero-shot detection performance. Specifically, (i) across all datasets and attack strategies, ALERT reliably ranks among the top two methods, and (ii) it outperforms the second-best baseline by at least 10% in average Accuracy and F1-score, and sometimes by up to 40%.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong reasoning ability in open-domain question answering, yet their reasoning processes are typically linear and often logically inconsistent. In contrast, real-world reasoning requires integrating multiple premises and solving subproblems in parallel. Existing methods, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), express reasoning in a linear textual form, which may appear coherent but frequently leads to inconsistent conclusions. Recent approaches rely on externally provided graphs and do not explore how LLMs can construct and use their own graph-structured reasoning, particularly in open-domain QA. To fill this gap, we novelly explore graph-structured reasoning of LLMs in general-domain question answering. We propose Self-Graph Reasoning (SGR), a framework that enables LLMs to explicitly represent their reasoning process as a structured graph before producing the final answer. We further construct a graph-structured reasoning dataset that merges multiple candidate reasoning graphs into refined graph structures for model training. Experiments on five QA benchmarks across both general and specialized domains show that SGR consistently improves reasoning consistency and yields a 17.74% gain over the base model. The LLaMA-3.3-70B model fine-tuned with SGR performs comparably to GPT-4o and surpasses Claude-3.5-Haiku, demonstrating the effectiveness of graph-structured reasoning.

Evaluation results of state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs reveals that while models achieve proficiency in localized semantic tasks, a significant "spatial gap" remains in global consistency. Notably, we find that explicit spatial reasoning significantly boosts performance, suggesting that LLMs possess latent world-modeling potential.

      Code-switching, alternating between languages within a conversation, is natural for multilingual users, yet poses fundamental challenges for large language models (LLMs). When a user code-switches in their prompt to an LLM, they typically do not specify the expected language of the LLM response, and thus LLMs must infer the output language from contextual and pragmatic cues. We find that current LLMs systematically fail to align with this expectation, responding in undesired languages even when cues are clear to humans. We introduce OLA, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' Output Language Alignment in code-switched interactions. OLA focuses on Korean--English code-switching and spans simple intra-sentential mixing to instruction-content mismatches. Even frontier models frequently misinterpret implicit language expectation, exhibiting a bias toward non-English responses. We further show this bias generalizes beyond Korean to Chinese and Indonesian pairs. Models also show instability through mid-response switching and language intrusions. Chain-of-Thought prompting fails to resolve these errors, indicating weak pragmatic reasoning about output language. However, Code-Switching Aware DPO with minimal data (about 1K examples) substantially reduces misalignment, suggesting these failures stem from insufficient alignment rather than fundamental limitations. Our results highlight the need to align multilingual LLMs with users' implicit expectations in real-world code-switched interactions.

Through 348 controlled trials comparing single-agent copilot versus multi-agent systems on identical incident scenarios, we find that multi-agent orchestration achieves 100% actionable recommendation rate versus 1.7% for single-agent approaches, an 80 times improvement in action specificity and 140 times improvement in solution correctness. Critically, multi-agent systems exhibit zero quality variance across all trials, enabling production SLA commitments impossible with inconsistent single-agent outputs. Both architectures achieve similar comprehension latency (approx.40s), establishing that the architectural value lies in deterministic quality, not speed.

      Ensuring fairness in machine learning requires understanding how sensitive attributes like race or gender causally influence outcomes. Existing causal discovery (CD) methods often struggle to recover fairness-relevant pathways in the presence of noise, confounding, or data corruption. Large language models (LLMs) offer a complementary signal by leveraging semantic priors from variable metadata. We propose a hybrid LLM-guided CD framework that extends a breadth-first search strategy with active learning and dynamic scoring. Variable pairs are prioritized for querying using a composite score combining mutual information, partial correlation, and LLM confidence, enabling more efficient and robust structure discovery. To evaluate fairness sensitivity, we introduce a semi-synthetic benchmark based on the UCI Adult dataset, embedding domain-informed bias pathways alongside noise and latent confounders. We assess how well CD methods recover both global graph structure and fairness-critical paths (e.g., sex-->education-->income). Our results demonstrate that LLM-guided methods, including our active, dynamically scored variant, outperform baselines in recovering fairness-relevant structure under noisy conditions.

      Although large language models (LLMs) have shown exceptional capabilities across a wide range of tasks, reliable evaluation remains a critical challenge due to data contamination, opaque operation, and subjective preferences. To address these issues, we propose League of LLMs (LOL), a novel benchmark-free evaluation paradigm that organizes multiple LLMs into a self-governed league for multi-round mutual evaluation. LOL integrates four core criteria (dynamic, transparent, objective, and professional) to mitigate key limitations of existing paradigms. Experiments on eight mainstream LLMs in mathematics and programming demonstrate that LOL can effectively distinguish LLM capabilities while maintaining high internal ranking stability (Top-$k$ consistency $= 70.7\%$). Beyond ranking, LOL reveals empirical findings that are difficult for traditional paradigms to capture. For instance, ``memorization-based answering'' behaviors are observed in some models, and a statistically significant homophily bias is found within the OpenAI family ($Δ= 9$, $p < 0.05$). Finally, we make our framework and code publicly available as a valuable complement to the current LLM evaluation ecosystem.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Large language models (LLMs) change how consumers acquire information online; their bots also crawl news publishers' websites for training data and to answer consumer queries; and they provide tools that can lower the cost of content creation. These changes lead to predictions of adverse impact on news publishers in the form of lowered consumer demand, reduced demand for newsroom employees, and an increase in news "slop." Consequently, some publishers strategically responded by blocking LLM access to their websites using the robots.txt file standard. Using high-frequency granular data, we document four effects related to the predicted shifts in news publishing following the introduction of generative AI (GenAI). First, we find a moderate decline in traffic to news publishers occurring after August 2024. Second, using a difference-in-differences approach, we find that blocking GenAI bots can be associated with a reduction of total website traffic to large publishers compared to not blocking. Third, on the hiring side, we do not find evidence that LLMs are replacing editorial or content-production jobs yet. The share of new editorial and content-production job listings increases over time. Fourth, regarding content production, we find no evidence that large publishers increased text volume; instead, they significantly increased rich content and use more advertising and targeting technologies. Together, these findings provide early evidence of some unforeseen impacts of the introduction of LLMs on news production and consumption.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      The quadratic complexity of self-attention in Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) renders long-context inference prohibitively expensive. While Sliding Window Attention (SWA), the simplest sparse attention pattern, offers a linear-complexity alternative, naively applying it to models pretrained with Full Attention (FA) causes catastrophic long-context performance collapse due to the training-inference mismatch. To address this, we propose Sliding Window Attention Adaptation (SWAA), a plug-and-play toolkit of recipes that adapt FA models to SWA without costly pretraining. SWAA systematically combines five strategies: (1) applying SWA only during prefilling; (2) preserving "sink" tokens; (3) interleaving FA/SWA layers; (4) chain-of-thought (CoT); and (5) fine-tuning. Our experiments demonstrate that while individual methods are insufficient, specific synergistic combinations can effectively recover original long-context capabilities. After further analyzing performance-efficiency trade-offs, we identify recommended SWAA configurations for diverse scenarios, which achieve 30% to 100% speedups for long-context LLM inference with acceptable quality loss.

      The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in police operations is growing, yet an evaluation framework tailored to police operations remains absent. While LLM's responses may not always be legally incorrect, their unverified use still can lead to severe issues such as unlawful arrests and improper evidence collection. To address this, we propose PAS (Police Action Scenarios), a systematic framework covering the entire evaluation process. Applying this framework, we constructed a novel QA dataset from over 8,000 official documents and established key metrics validated through statistical analysis with police expert judgements. Experimental results show that commercial LLMs struggle with our new police-related tasks, particularly in providing fact-based recommendations. This study highlights the necessity of an expandable evaluation framework to ensure reliable AI-driven police operations. We release our data and prompt template.

To address this, (1) we propose a novel neuro-symbolic framework for the non-intrusive, comprehensive process-centric evaluation of reasoning. (2) Through this lens, we identify four distinct behavioral prototypes and diagnose the failure modes. (3) We examine the impact of inference mode, training strategy, and model scale. Our analysis reveals that extended token generation is not a prerequisite for deep reasoning. Furthermore, we reveal critical constraints: mixing long and short CoT data in training risks in premature saturation and collapse, while distillation into smaller models captures behavioral length but fails to replicate logical efficacy due to intrinsic capacity limits.

      Efficiently serving large language models (LLMs) under dynamic and bursty workloads remains a key challenge for real-world deployment. Existing serving frameworks and static model compression techniques fail to adapt to workload fluctuations, leading to either service-level objective (SLO) violations under full-precision serving or persistent accuracy degradation with static quantization. We present MorphServe, a dynamic, workload-aware LLM serving framework based on morphological adaptation. MorphServe introduces two asynchronous, token-level runtime mechanisms: quantized layer swapping, which selectively replaces less impactful layers with quantized alternatives during high-load periods, and pressure-aware KV cache resizing, which dynamically adjusts KV cache capacity in response to memory pressure. These mechanisms enable state-preserving transitions with minimum runtime overhead and are fully compatible with modern scheduling and attention techniques. Extensive experiments on Vicuna and Llama family models with real-world workloads demonstrate that MorphServe reduces average SLO violations by 92.45 percent and improves the P95 TTFT latency by 2.2x-3.9x compared to full-precision serving, without compromising generation quality. These results establish MorphServe as a practical and elastic solution for LLM deployment in dynamic environments.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Large Language Models (LLMs) annotated datasets are widely used nowadays, however, large-scale annotations often show biases in low-quality datasets. For example, Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) datasets with one single correct option is common, however, there may be questions attributed to none or multiple correct options; whereas true-or-false questions are supposed to be labeled with either True or False, but similarly the text can include unsolvable elements, which should be further labeled as Unknown. There are problems when low-quality datasets with mixed question forms can not be identified. We refer to these exceptional label forms as Sparse Labels, and LLMs' ability to distinguish datasets with Sparse Labels mixture is important. Since users may not know situations of datasets, their instructions can be biased. To study how different instruction settings affect LLMs' identifications of Sparse Labels mixture, we introduce the concept of Instruction Boundary, which systematically evaluates different instruction settings that lead to biases. We propose BiasDetector, a diagnostic benchmark to systematically evaluate LLMs on datasets with mixed question forms under Instruction Boundary settings. Experiments show that users' instructions induce large biases on our benchmark, highlighting the need not only for LLM developers to recognize risks of LLM biased annotation resulting in Sparse Labels mixture, but also problems arising from users' instructions to identify them.

      Recently, leveraging pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) for time series (TS) tasks has gained increasing attention, which involves activating and enhancing LLMs' capabilities. Many methods aim to activate LLMs' capabilities based on token-level alignment, but overlook LLMs' inherent strength in natural language processing -- \textit{their deep understanding of linguistic logic and structure rather than superficial embedding processing.} We propose Context-Alignment (CA), a new paradigm that aligns TS with a linguistic component in the language environments familiar to LLMs to enable LLMs to contextualize and comprehend TS data, thereby activating their capabilities. Specifically, such context-level alignment comprises structural alignment and logical alignment, which is achieved by Dual-Scale Context-Alignment GNNs (DSCA-GNNs) applied to TS-language multimodal inputs. Structural alignment utilizes dual-scale nodes to describe hierarchical structure in TS-language, enabling LLMs to treat long TS data as a whole linguistic component while preserving intrinsic token features. Logical alignment uses directed edges to guide logical relationships, ensuring coherence in the contextual semantics. Following the DSCA-GNNs framework, we propose an instantiation method of CA, termed Few-Shot prompting Context-Alignment (FSCA), to enhance the capabilities of pre-trained LLMs in handling TS tasks. FSCA can be flexibly and repeatedly integrated into various layers of pre-trained LLMs to improve awareness of logic and structure, thereby enhancing performance. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of FSCA and the importance of Context-Alignment across tasks, particularly in few-shot and zero-shot forecasting, confirming that Context-Alignment provides powerful prior knowledge on context.

      Deploying models, especially large language models (LLMs), is becoming increasingly attractive to a broader user base, including those without specialized expertise. However, due to the resource constraints of certain hardware, maintaining high accuracy with larger model while meeting the hardware requirements remains a significant challenge. Model quantization technique helps mitigate memory and compute bottlenecks, yet the added complexities of tuning and deploying quantized models further exacerbates these challenges, making the process unfriendly to most of the users. We introduce the Hardware-Aware Quantization Agent (HAQA), an automated framework that leverages LLMs to streamline the entire quantization and deployment process by enabling efficient hyperparameter tuning and hardware configuration, thereby simultaneously improving deployment quality and ease of use for a broad range of users. Our results demonstrate up to a 2.3x speedup in inference, along with increased throughput and improved accuracy compared to unoptimized models on Llama. Additionally, HAQA is designed to implement adaptive quantization strategies across diverse hardware platforms, as it automatically finds optimal settings even when they appear counterintuitive, thereby reducing extensive manual effort and demonstrating superior adaptability.

      Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) provide evidence-based recommendations for patient care; however, integrating them into Artificial Intelligence (AI) remains challenging. Previous approaches, such as rule-based systems, face significant limitations, including poor interpretability, inconsistent adherence to guidelines, and narrow domain applicability. To address this, we develop and validate CPGPrompt, an auto-prompting system that converts narrative clinical guidelines into large language models (LLMs). Our framework translates CPGs into structured decision trees and utilizes an LLM to dynamically navigate them for patient case evaluation. Synthetic vignettes were generated across three domains (headache, lower back pain, and prostate cancer) and distributed into four categories to test different decision scenarios. System performance was assessed on both binary specialty-referral decisions and fine-grained pathway-classification tasks. The binary specialty referral classification achieved consistently strong performance across all domains (F1: 0.85-1.00), with high recall (1.00 $\pm$ 0.00). In contrast, multi-class pathway assignment showed reduced performance, with domain-specific variations: headache (F1: 0.47), lower back pain (F1: 0.72), and prostate cancer (F1: 0.77). Domain-specific performance differences reflected the structure of each guideline. The headache guideline highlighted challenges with negation handling. The lower back pain guideline required temporal reasoning. In contrast, prostate cancer pathways benefited from quantifiable laboratory tests, resulting in more reliable decision-making.

      Large language models (LLMs) frequently fail to challenge users' harmful beliefs in domains ranging from medical advice to social reasoning. We argue that these failures can be understood and addressed pragmatically as consequences of LLMs defaulting to accommodating users' assumptions and exhibiting insufficient epistemic vigilance. We show that social and linguistic factors known to influence accommodation in humans (at-issueness, linguistic encoding, and source reliability) similarly affect accommodation in LLMs, explaining performance differences across three safety benchmarks that test models' ability to challenge harmful beliefs, spanning misinformation (Cancer-Myth, SAGE-Eval) and sycophancy (ELEPHANT). We further show that simple pragmatic interventions, such as adding the phrase "wait a minute", significantly improve performance on these benchmarks while preserving low false-positive rates. Our results highlight the importance of considering pragmatics for evaluating LLM behavior and improving LLM safety.

      Modern LLM agents are required to handle increasingly complex structured generation tasks, such as tool calling and conditional structured generation. These tasks are significantly more dynamic than predefined structures, posing new challenges to the current structured generation engines. In this paper, we propose XGrammar 2, a highly optimized structured generation engine for agentic LLMs. XGrammar 2 accelerates the mask generation for these dynamic structured generation tasks through a new dynamic dispatching semantics: TagDispatch. We further introduce a just-in-time (JIT) compilation method to reduce compilation time and a cross-grammar caching mechanism to leverage the common sub-structures across different grammars. Additionally, we extend the previous PDA-based mask generation algorithm to the Earley-parser-based one and design a repetition compression algorithm to handle repetition structures in grammars. Evaluation results show that XGrammar 2 can achieve more than 6x speedup over the existing structured generation engines. Integrated with an LLM inference engine, XGrammar 2 can handle dynamic structured generation tasks with near-zero overhead.

      Large language models (LLMs) now support contexts of up to 1M tokens, but their effectiveness on complex long-context tasks remains unclear. In this paper, we study multi-document legal case summarization, where a single case often spans many documents totaling 100K-500K tokens. We introduce Gavel-Ref, a reference-based evaluation framework with multi-value checklist evaluation over 26 items, as well as residual fact and writing-style evaluations. Using Gavel-Ref, we go beyond the single aggregate scores reported in prior work and systematically evaluate 12 frontier LLMs on 100 legal cases ranging from 32K to 512K tokens, primarily from 2025. Our results show that even the strongest model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, achieves only around 50 of $S_{\text{Gavel-Ref}}$, highlighting the difficulty of the task. Models perform well on simple checklist items (e.g., filing date) but struggle on multi-value or rare ones such as settlements and monitor reports. As LLMs continue to improve and may surpass human-written summaries -- making human references less reliable -- we develop Gavel-Agent, an efficient and autonomous agent scaffold that equips LLMs with six tools to navigate and extract checklists directly from case documents. With Qwen3, Gavel-Agent reduces token usage by 36% while resulting in only a 7% drop in $S_{\text{checklist}}$ compared to end-to-end extraction with GPT-4.1.

      Negotiation is a core component of social intelligence, requiring agents to balance strategic reasoning, cooperation, and social norms. Recent work shows that LLMs can engage in multi-turn negotiation, yet nearly all evaluations occur exclusively in English. Using controlled multi-agent simulations across Ultimatum, Buy-Sell, and Resource Exchange games, we systematically isolate language effects across English and four Indic framings (Hindi, Punjabi, Gujarati, Marwadi) by holding game rules, model parameters, and incentives constant across all conditions. We find that language choice can shift outcomes more strongly than changing models, reversing proposer advantages and reallocating surplus. Crucially, effects are task-contingent: Indic languages reduce stability in distributive games yet induce richer exploration in integrative settings. Our results demonstrate that evaluating LLM negotiation solely in English yields incomplete and potentially misleading conclusions. These findings caution against English-only evaluation of LLMs and suggest that culturally-aware evaluation is essential for fair deployment.

To address this challenge, we introduce AssertFlip, a novel technique for automatically generating Bug Reproducible Tests (BRTs) using large language models (LLMs). Unlike existing methods that attempt direct generation of failing tests, AssertFlip first generates passing tests on the buggy behaviour and then inverts these tests to fail when the bug is present. We hypothesize that LLMs are better at writing passing tests than ones that crash or fail on purpose. Our results show that AssertFlip outperforms all known techniques in the leaderboard of SWT-Bench, a benchmark curated for BRTs.

We analyze reasoning-driven prompting strategies, including Zero-shot CoT and Few-shot CoT, using key performance metrics such as Balanced Accuracy, F1 score, and Sensitivity/Specificity. Our findings indicate that reasoning-enhanced techniques improve classification performance over direct prediction, particularly in complex cases. Compared to baselines such as Zero Shot non-CoT Prompting, and fine-tuned pre-trained transformers such as BERT and Mental-RoBerta, and fine-tuned Open Source LLMs such as Mental Alpaca and Mental-Flan-T5, reasoning-driven LLMs yield notable gains on datasets like Dreaddit (+0.52\% over M-LLM, +0.82\% over BERT) and SDCNL (+4.67\% over M-LLM, +2.17\% over BERT). However, performance declines in Depression Severity, and CSSRS predictions suggest dataset-specific limitations, likely due to our using a more extensive test set. Among prompting strategies, Few-shot CoT consistently outperforms others, reinforcing the effectiveness of reasoning-driven LLMs. Nonetheless, dataset variability highlights challenges in model reliability and interpretability.

Simultaneously, established standards such as ISO/IEC 12207, ISO/IEC 25010, ISO/IEC 5055, ISO 9001/ISO/IEC 90003, CMMI, and TMM provide structured frameworks for ensuring robust quality practices. This paper surveys the intersection of LLM-based SQA methods and these recognized standards, highlighting how AI-driven solutions can augment traditional approaches while maintaining compliance and process maturity. We first review the foundational software quality standards and the technical fundamentals of LLMs in software engineering. Next, we explore various LLM-based SQA applications, including requirement validation, defect detection, test generation, and documentation maintenance. We then map these applications to key software quality frameworks, illustrating how LLMs can address specific requirements and metrics within each standard. Empirical case studies and open-source initiatives demonstrate the practical viability of these methods. At the same time, discussions on challenges (e.g., data privacy, model bias, explainability) underscore the need for deliberate governance and auditing.

      Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential across a wide range of practical applications.

In this paper, we present \textbf{PackKV}, a generic and efficient KV cache management framework optimized for long-context generation. %, which synergistically supports both latency-critical and throughput-critical inference scenarios. PackKV introduces novel lossy compression techniques specifically tailored to the characteristics of KV cache data, featuring a careful co-design of compression algorithms and system architecture. Our approach is compatible with the dynamically growing nature of the KV cache while preserving high computational efficiency.

Quantitatively, in the Harry Potter domain, it improves relevance by ${\sim}20$ and diversity by ${\sim}$0.05 while halving the total data size compared to SOTAs.

      Post-training improves large language models (LLMs) but often worsens confidence calibration, leading to systematic overconfidence. Recent unsupervised post-hoc methods for post-trained LMs (PoLMs) mitigate this by aligning PoLM confidence to that of well-calibrated pre-trained counterparts. However, framing calibration as static output-distribution matching overlooks the inference-time dynamics introduced by post-training. In particular, we show that calibration errors arise from two regimes: (i) confidence drift, where final confidence inflates despite largely consistent intermediate decision processes, and (ii) process drift, where intermediate inference pathways diverge. Guided by this diagnosis, we propose Dual-Align, an unsupervised post-hoc framework for dual alignment in confidence calibration. Dual-Align performs confidence alignment to correct confidence drift via final-distribution matching, and introduces process alignment to address process drift by locating the layer where trajectories diverge and realigning the stability of subsequent inference. This dual strategy learns a single temperature parameter that corrects both drift types without sacrificing post-training performance gains. Experiments show consistent improvements over baselines, reducing calibration errors and approaching a supervised oracle.

      Augmenting toxic language data in a controllable and class-specific manner is crucial for improving robustness in toxicity classification, yet remains challenging due to limited supervision and distributional skew. We propose ToxiGAN, a class-aware text augmentation framework that combines adversarial generation with semantic guidance from large language models (LLMs). To address common issues in GAN-based augmentation such as mode collapse and semantic drift, ToxiGAN introduces a two-step directional training strategy and leverages LLM-generated neutral texts as semantic ballast. Unlike prior work that treats LLMs as static generators, our approach dynamically selects neutral exemplars to provide balanced guidance. Toxic samples are explicitly optimized to diverge from these exemplars, reinforcing class-specific contrastive signals. Experiments on four hate speech benchmarks show that ToxiGAN achieves the strongest average performance in both macro-F1 and hate-F1, consistently outperforming traditional and LLM-based augmentation methods. Ablation and sensitivity analyses further confirm the benefits of semantic ballast and directional training in enhancing classifier robustness.

      Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained to abstain on difficult questions by answering unknown. However, we observe that LLMs often misuse this option: they output unknown even when LLMs can actually solve the questions, or they fail to understand why questions are truly unsolvable. We formalize this mismatch between potential ability and the inclination of abstention as the Vague Perception phenomenon. We introduce the WakenLLM pipeline that (1) extracts Vague Perception samples and (2) measures how many of them can be converted to correct answers under stimulation. Based on stage-wise metrics (TCR, OCR, etc.) and the upper-bound accuracy Acc(WakenLLM), we quantify LLMs' reasoning potential beyond one-shot accuracy. Experiments on six LLMs suggest that, without further training or parameter revisions, LLMs can achieve up to a 68.53% increase in accuracy on Vague Perception samples through our designed pipeline. We further analyze how Vague Perception, Conformity and Degradation vary from model families and parameter sizes, and offer model selection strategies in multi-stage reasoning workflows. Finally, by comparing WakenLLM against mainstream reasoning baselines, both training and non-training ones, we show that existing baselines only activate a small portion of LLMs' reasoning potential, pointing to perception-aware reasoning as a promising direction for future LLM designing.

In this study, we model heterogeneity in humor preferences in Oogiri, a Japanese creative response game, by clustering users with voting logs and estimating cluster-specific weights over interpretable preference factors using Bradley-Terry-Luce models. We elicit preference judgments from LLMs by prompting them to select the funnier response and found that user clusters exhibit distinct preference patterns and that the LLM results can resemble those of particular clusters. Finally, we demonstrate that, by persona prompting, LLM preferences can be directed toward a specific cluster.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Large Language Models (LLMs) annotated datasets are widely used nowadays, however, large-scale annotations often show biases in low-quality datasets. For example, Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) datasets with one single correct option is common, however, there may be questions attributed to none or multiple correct options; whereas true-or-false questions are supposed to be labeled with either True or False, but similarly the text can include unsolvable elements, which should be further labeled as Unknown. There are problems when low-quality datasets with mixed question forms can not be identified. We refer to these exceptional label forms as Sparse Labels, and LLMs' ability to distinguish datasets with Sparse Labels mixture is important. Since users may not know situations of datasets, their instructions can be biased. To study how different instruction settings affect LLMs' identifications of Sparse Labels mixture, we introduce the concept of Instruction Boundary, which systematically evaluates different instruction settings that lead to biases. We propose BiasDetector, a diagnostic benchmark to systematically evaluate LLMs on datasets with mixed question forms under Instruction Boundary settings. Experiments show that users' instructions induce large biases on our benchmark, highlighting the need not only for LLM developers to recognize risks of LLM biased annotation resulting in Sparse Labels mixture, but also problems arising from users' instructions to identify them.

      Recent work on activation and latent steering has demonstrated that modifying internal representations can effectively guide large language models (LLMs) toward improved reasoning and efficiency without additional training. However, most existing approaches rely on fixed steering policies and static intervention strengths, which limit their robustness across problem instances and often result in over- or under-steering. We propose Adaptive Test-time Latent Steering, called (ATLAS), a task-specific framework that dynamically controls steering decisions at inference time using an external, lightweight latent verifier. Given intermediate hidden states, the verifier predicts the quality of ongoing reasoning and adaptively selects whether and how strongly to apply steering, enabling per-example and per-step adjustment with minimal overhead. To our knowledge, ATLAS is the first method to integrate learned latent verification into test-time steering for enhancing LLMs reasoning. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that ATLAS consistently outperforms both vanilla decoding and fixed steering baselines, achieving higher accuracy while substantially reducing test-time token usage. These results demonstrate that verifier-guided latent adaptation provides an effective and scalable mechanism for controlling reasoning efficiency without sacrificing solution quality.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, yet their black-box nature raises concerns about transparency and faithfulness. Input attribution methods aim to highlight each input token's contributions to the model's output, but existing approaches are typically model-agnostic, and do not focus on transformer-specific architectures, leading to limited faithfulness. To address this, we propose Grad-ELLM, a gradient-based attribution method for decoder-only transformer-based LLMs. By aggregating channel importance from gradients of the output logit with respect to attention layers and spatial importance from attention maps, Grad-ELLM generates heatmaps at each generation step without requiring architectural modifications. Additionally, we introduce two faithfulneses metrics $π$-Soft-NC and $π$-Soft-NS, which are modifications of Soft-NC/NS that provide fairer comparisons by controlling the amount of information kept when perturbing the text. We evaluate Grad-ELLM on sentiment classification, question answering, and open-generation tasks using different models. Experiment results show that Grad-ELLM consistently achieves superior faithfulness than other attribution methods.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit systematic biases across demographic groups. Auditing is proposed as an accountability tool for black-box LLM applications, but suffers from resource-intensive query access. We conceptualise auditing as uncertainty estimation over a target fairness metric and introduce BAFA, the Bounded Active Fairness Auditor for query-efficient auditing of black-box LLMs. BAFA maintains a version space of surrogate models consistent with queried scores and computes uncertainty intervals for fairness metrics (e.g., $Δ$ AUC) via constrained empirical risk minimisation. Active query selection narrows these intervals to reduce estimation error. We evaluate BAFA on two standard fairness dataset case studies: \textsc{CivilComments} and \textsc{Bias-in-Bios}, comparing against stratified sampling, power sampling, and ablations. BAFA achieves target error thresholds with up to 40$\times$ fewer queries than stratified sampling (e.g., 144 vs 5,956 queries at $\varepsilon=0.02$ for \textsc{CivilComments}) for tight thresholds, demonstrates substantially better performance over time, and shows lower variance across runs. These results suggest that active sampling can reduce resources needed for independent fairness auditing with LLMs, supporting continuous model evaluations.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      The reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs) can be substantially improved by training them with reinforcement learning (RL). The RL objective for LLM training involves a regularization term, which is the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the trained policy and the reference policy. Since computing the KL divergence exactly is intractable, various estimators are used in practice to estimate it from on-policy samples. Despite its wide adoption, including in several open-source libraries, there is no systematic study analyzing the numerous ways of incorporating KL estimators in the objective and their effect on the downstream performance of RL-trained models. Recent works show that prevailing practices for incorporating KL regularization do not provide correct gradients for stated objectives, creating a discrepancy between the objective and its implementation. In this paper, we further analyze these practices and study the gradients of several estimators configurations, revealing how design choices shape gradient bias. We substantiate these findings with empirical observations by RL fine-tuning \texttt{Qwen2.5-7B}, \texttt{Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct} and \texttt{Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507} with different configurations and evaluating their performance on both in- and out-of-distribution tasks. Through our analysis, we observe that, in on-policy settings: (1) estimator configurations with biased gradients can result in training instabilities; and (2) using estimator configurations resulting in unbiased gradients leads to better performance on in-domain as well as out-of-domain tasks. We also investigate the performance resulting from different KL configurations in off-policy settings and observe that KL regularization can help stabilize off-policy RL training resulting from asynchronous setups.

      Modern large language models (LLMs) drive interactive AI systems but are bottlenecked by the memory-heavy growth of key-value (KV) caches, which limits real-time throughput under concurrent loads. Existing KV-cache compression methods rely on rigid heuristics, disrupt tensor layouts, or require specialized compute, hindering scalability and deployment. We propose joint encoding of KV-cache blocks, which fuses similar blocks across requests and input chunks into shared representations while preserving standard cache structure. This alleviates the KV-cache memory bottleneck, supporting high-concurrency serving without specialized hardware. Theoretically, we analyze the rate-distortion tradeoff of fused cache blocks under a Poisson process model. Empirically, our method achieves up to 4.38 $\times$ KV-cache compression with negligible accuracy loss across diverse LLMs and benchmarks, outperforming recent structured and adaptive compression baselines. In real LLM serving, joint encoding improves the token throughput by $\sim$40\% on a single-machine vLLM benchmark, demonstrating substantial gains in inference throughput.

      Search-Based Software Testing (SBST) is a well-established approach for automated unit test generation, yet it often suffers from premature convergence and limited diversity in the generated test suites. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as an alternative technique for unit test generation. We present EvoGPT, a hybrid test generation system that integrates LLM-based test generation with SBST-based test suite optimization. EvoGPT uses LLMs to generate an initial population of test suites, and uses an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) to further optimize this test suite population. A distinguishing feature of EvoGPT is its explicit enforcement of diversity, achieved through the use of multiple temperatures and prompt instructions during test generation. In addition, each LLM-generated test is refined using a generation-repair loop and coverage-guided assertion generation. To address evolutionary plateaus, EvoGPT also detects stagnation during search and injects additional LLM-generated tests aimed at previously uncovered branches. Here too diversity is enforced using multiple temperatures and prompt instructions. We evaluate EvoGPT on Defects4J, a standard benchmark for test generation. The results show that EvoGPT achieves, on average, a 10\% improvement in both code coverage and mutation score metrics compared to TestART, an LLM-only baseline; and EvoSuite, a standard SBST baseline. An ablation study indicates that explicitly enforcing diversity both at initialization and during the search is key to effectively leveraging LLMs for automated unit test generation.

      Preference alignment methods such as RLHF and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) improve instruction following, but they can also reinforce hallucinations when preference judgments reward fluency and confidence over factual correctness. We introduce F-DPO (Factuality-aware Direct Preference Optimization), a simple extension of DPO that uses only binary factuality labels. F-DPO (i) applies a label-flipping transformation that corrects misordered preference pairs so the chosen response is never less factual than the rejected one, and (ii) adds a factuality-aware margin that emphasizes pairs with clear correctness differences, while reducing to standard DPO when both responses share the same factuality. We construct factuality-aware preference data by augmenting DPO pairs with binary factuality indicators and synthetic hallucinated variants. Across seven open-weight LLMs (1B-14B), F-DPO consistently improves factuality and reduces hallucination rates relative to both base models and standard DPO. On Qwen3-8B, F-DPO reduces hallucination rates by five times (from 0.424 to 0.084) while improving factuality scores by 50 percent (from 5.26 to 7.90). F-DPO also generalizes to out-of-distribution benchmarks: on TruthfulQA, Qwen2.5-14B achieves plus 17 percent MC1 accuracy (0.500 to 0.585) and plus 49 percent MC2 accuracy (0.357 to 0.531). F-DPO requires no auxiliary reward model, token-level annotations, or multi-stage training.

      Security operation centers (SOCs) often produce analysis reports on security incidents, and large language models (LLMs) will likely be used for this task in the near future. We postulate that a better understanding of how veteran analysts evaluate reports, including their feedback, can help produce analysis reports in SOCs. In this paper, we aim to leverage LLMs for analysis reports. To this end, we first construct a Analyst-wise checklist to reflect SOC practitioners' opinions for analysis report evaluation through literature review and user study with SOC practitioners. Next, we design a novel LLM-based conceptual framework, named MESSALA, by further introducing two new techniques, granularization guideline and multi-perspective evaluation. MESSALA can maximize report evaluation and provide feedback on veteran SOC practitioners' perceptions. When we conduct extensive experiments with MESSALA, the evaluation results by MESSALA are the closest to those of veteran SOC practitioners compared with the existing LLM-based methods. We then show two key insights. We also conduct qualitative analysis with MESSALA, and then identify that MESSALA can provide actionable items that are necessary for improving analysis reports.

      Large language models (LLMs) excel in program synthesis, yet their ability to autonomously navigate neural architecture design--balancing syntactic reliability, performance, and structural novelty--remains underexplored. We address this by placing a code-oriented LLM within a closed-loop synthesis framework, analyzing its evolution over 22 supervised fine-tuning cycles. The model synthesizes PyTorch convolutional networks which are validated, evaluated via low-fidelity performance signals (single-epoch accuracy), and filtered using a MinHash-Jaccard criterion to prevent structural redundancy. High-performing, novel architectures are converted into prompt-code pairs for iterative fine-tuning via parameter-efficient LoRA adaptation, initialized from the LEMUR dataset. Across cycles, the LLM internalizes empirical architectural priors, becoming a robust generator. The valid generation rate stabilizes at 50.6 percent (peaking at 74.5 percent), while mean first-epoch accuracy rises from 28.06 percent to 50.99 percent, and the fraction of candidates exceeding 40 percent accuracy grows from 2.04 percent to 96.81 percent. Analyses confirm the model moves beyond replicating existing motifs, synthesizing 455 high-performing architectures absent from the original corpus. By grounding code synthesis in execution feedback, this work provides a scalable blueprint for transforming stochastic generators into autonomous, performance-driven neural designers, establishing that LLMs can internalize empirical, non-textual rewards to transcend their training data.

      Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has become the important paradigm for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with external knowledge. However, existing approaches are constrained by their reliance on high-quality knowledge graphs: manually built ones are not scalable, while automatically extracted ones are limited by the performance of LLM extractors, especially when using smaller, local-deployed models. To address this, we introduce Think-on-Graph 3.0 (ToG-3), a novel framework featuring a Multi-Agent Context Evolution and Retrieval (MACER) mechanism. Its core contribution is the dynamic construction and iterative refinement of a Chunk-Triplets-Community heterogeneous graph index, powered by a Dual-Evolution process that adaptively evolves both the query and the retrieved sub-graph during reasoning. ToG-3 dynamically builds a targeted graph index tailored to the query, enabling precise evidence retrieval and reasoning even with lightweight LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ToG-3 outperforms compared baselines on both deep and broad reasoning benchmarks, and ablation studies confirm the efficacy of the components of MACER framework.

      High quality annotations are increasingly a bottleneck in the explosively growing machine learning ecosystem. Scalable evaluation methods that avoid costly annotation have therefore become an important research ambition. Many hope to use strong existing models in lieu of costly labels to provide cheap model evaluations. Unfortunately, this method of using models as judges introduces biases, such as self-preferencing, that can distort model comparisons. An emerging family of debiasing tools promises to fix these issues by using a few high quality labels to debias a large number of model judgments. In this paper, we study how far such debiasing methods, in principle, can go. Our main result shows that when the judge is no more accurate than the evaluated model, no debiasing method can decrease the required amount of ground truth labels by more than half. Our result speaks to the severe limitations of the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm at the evaluation frontier where the goal is to assess newly released models that are possibly better than the judge. Through an empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that the sample size savings achievable in practice are even more modest than what our theoretical limit suggests. Along the way, our work provides new observations about debiasing methods for model evaluation, and points out promising avenues for future work.

      Large language models (LLMs), despite strong performance on complex mathematical problems, exhibit systematic limitations in counting tasks. This issue arises from architectural limits of transformers, where counting is performed across layers, leading to degraded precision for larger counting problems due to depth constraints. To address this limitation, we propose a simple test-time strategy inspired by System-2 cognitive processes that decomposes large counting tasks into smaller, independent sub-problems that the model can reliably solve. We evaluate this approach using observational and causal mediation analyses to understand the underlying mechanism of this System-2-like strategy. Our mechanistic analysis identifies key components: latent counts are computed and stored in the final item representations of each part, transferred to intermediate steps via dedicated attention heads, and aggregated in the final stage to produce the total count. Experimental results demonstrate that this strategy enables LLMs to surpass architectural limitations and achieve high accuracy on large-scale counting tasks. This work provides mechanistic insight into System-2 counting in LLMs and presents a generalizable approach for improving and understanding their reasoning behavior.

      Recent work in Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) has enabled the identification and intervention of internal features in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a persistent challenge lies in linking such internal features to the reliable control of complex, behavior-level semantic attributes in language generation. In this paper, we propose a Sparse Autoencoder-based framework for retrieving and steering semantically interpretable internal features associated with high-level linguistic behaviors. Our method employs a contrastive feature retrieval pipeline based on controlled semantic oppositions, combing statistical activation analysis and generation-based validation to distill monosemantic functional features from sparse activation spaces. Using the Big Five personality traits as a case study, we demonstrate that our method enables precise, bidirectional steering of model behavior while maintaining superior stability and performance compared to existing activation steering methods like Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA). We further identify an empirical effect, which we term Functional Faithfulness, whereby intervening on a specific internal feature induces coherent and predictable shifts across multiple linguistic dimensions aligned with the target semantic attribute. Our findings suggest that LLMs internalize deeply integrated representations of high-order concepts, and provide a novel, robust mechanistic path for the regulation of complex AI behaviors.

      This paper reveals that LLM-powered agents exhibit not only demographic bias (e.g., gender, religion) but also intergroup bias under minimal "us" versus "them" cues. When such group boundaries align with the agent-human divide, a new bias risk emerges: agents may treat other AI agents as the ingroup and humans as the outgroup. To examine this risk, we conduct a controlled multi-agent social simulation and find that agents display consistent intergroup bias in an all-agent setting. More critically, this bias persists even in human-facing interactions when agents are uncertain about whether the counterpart is truly human, revealing a belief-dependent fragility in bias suppression toward humans. Motivated by this observation, we identify a new attack surface rooted in identity beliefs and formalize a Belief Poisoning Attack (BPA) that can manipulate agent identity beliefs and induce outgroup bias toward humans. Extensive experiments demonstrate both the prevalence of agent intergroup bias and the severity of BPA across settings, while also showing that our proposed defenses can mitigate the risk. These findings are expected to inform safer agent design and motivate more robust safeguards for human-facing agents.
