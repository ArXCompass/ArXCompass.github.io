      Although large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing capabilities, their practical implementation as autonomous multi-agent systems (MAS) for industrial problem-solving encounters persistent barriers. Conventional MAS architectures are fundamentally restricted by inflexible, hand-crafted graph topologies that lack contextual responsiveness, resulting in diminished efficacy across varied academic and commercial workloads. To surmount these constraints, we introduce AMAS, a paradigm-shifting framework that redefines LLM-based MAS through a novel dynamic graph designer. This component autonomously identifies task-specific optimal graph configurations via lightweight LLM adaptation, eliminating the reliance on monolithic, universally applied structural templates. Instead, AMAS exploits the intrinsic properties of individual inputs to intelligently direct query trajectories through task-optimized agent pathways. Rigorous validation across question answering, mathematical deduction, and code generation benchmarks confirms that AMAS systematically exceeds state-of-the-art single-agent and multi-agent approaches across diverse LLM architectures. Our investigation establishes that context-sensitive structural adaptability constitutes a foundational requirement for high-performance LLM MAS deployments.

      Interactive conversational recommender systems have gained significant attention for their ability to capture user preferences through natural language interactions. However, existing approaches face substantial challenges in handling dynamic user preferences, maintaining conversation coherence, and balancing multiple ranking objectives simultaneously. This paper introduces AgentRec, a next-generation LLM-powered multi-agent collaborative recommendation framework that addresses these limitations through hierarchical agent networks with adaptive intelligence. Our approach employs specialized LLM-powered agents for conversation understanding, preference modeling, context awareness, and dynamic ranking, coordinated through an adaptive weighting mechanism that learns from interaction patterns. We propose a three-tier learning strategy combining rapid response for simple queries, intelligent reasoning for complex preferences, and deep collaboration for challenging scenarios. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that AgentRec achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, with 2.8\% enhancement in conversation success rate, 1.9\% improvement in recommendation accuracy (NDCG@10), and 3.2\% better conversation efficiency while maintaining comparable computational costs through intelligent agent coordination.

      Software repositories contain valuable information for understanding the development process. However, extracting insights from repository data is time-consuming and requires technical expertise. While software engineering chatbots support natural language interactions with repositories, chatbots struggle to understand questions beyond their trained intents and to accurately retrieve the relevant data. This study aims to improve the accuracy of LLM-based chatbots in answering repository-related questions by augmenting them with knowledge graphs. We use a two-step approach: constructing a knowledge graph from repository data, and synergizing the knowledge graph with an LLM to handle natural language questions and answers. We curated 150 questions of varying complexity and evaluated the approach on five popular open-source projects. Our initial results revealed the limitations of the approach, with most errors due to the reasoning ability of the LLM. We therefore applied few-shot chain-of-thought prompting, which improved accuracy to 84%. We also compared against baselines (MSRBot and GPT-4o-search-preview), and our approach performed significantly better. In a task-based user study with 20 participants, users completed more tasks correctly and in less time with our approach, and they reported that it was useful. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs and knowledge graphs are a viable solution for making repository data accessible.

      Domain reweighting is an emerging research area aimed at adjusting the relative weights of different data sources to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of LLM pre-training. We show that data mixtures that perform well at smaller scales may not retain their advantage at larger scales, challenging the existing practice of determining competitive mixtures in small-scale experiments and directly applying them at much larger scales. To address this, we propose AutoScale, a two-stage, scale-aware data composition framework. First, AutoScale fits a parametric model that predicts the model's loss under different data compositions, then uses it to find an approximate best allocation at smaller, more manageable budgets. Next, leveraging a novel theoretical analysis of how optimal compositions evolve with scale, AutoScale extrapolates that composition to larger budgets without further retraining. Empirically, AutoScale accelerates convergence and improves downstream performance. For instance, when pre-training GPT-2 Large, it achieves a 28% faster perplexity reduction than baselines and up to a 38% speed-up over unweighted training, while yielding best-average results on various downstream tasks. Overall, our findings illustrate how domain importance shifts with training scale, underscoring the need for scale-dependent data curation in LLM training. Our code is open-sourced.

      While slow-thinking large language models (LLMs) exhibit reflection-like reasoning, commonly referred to as the "aha moment:, their ability to generate informative critiques and refine prior solutions remains limited. In this paper, we introduce Double-Checker, a principled framework designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of slow-thinking LLMs by fostering explicit self-critique and iterative refinement of their previous solutions. By fine-tuning on our curated 1,730 self-critical instances, Double-Checker empowers long-CoT LLMs to iteratively critique and refine their outputs during inference until they evaluate their solutions as correct under self-generated critiques. We validate the efficacy of Double-Checker across a comprehensive suite of reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating that iterative self-critique significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of long-CoT LLMs. Notably, our Double-Checker increases the pass@1 performance on challenging AIME benchmarks from 4.4% to 18.2% compared to the original long-CoT LLMs. These results highlight a promising direction for developing more trustworthy and effective LLMs capable of structured self-critique.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are intensively used to assist security analysts in counteracting the rapid exploitation of cyber threats, wherein LLMs offer cyber threat intelligence (CTI) to support vulnerability assessment and incident response. While recent work has shown that LLMs can support a wide range of CTI tasks such as threat analysis, vulnerability detection, and intrusion defense, significant performance gaps persist in practical deployments. In this paper, we investigate the intrinsic vulnerabilities of LLMs in CTI, focusing on challenges that arise from the nature of the threat landscape itself rather than the model architecture. Using large-scale evaluations across multiple CTI benchmarks and real-world threat reports, we introduce a novel categorization methodology that integrates stratification, autoregressive refinement, and human-in-the-loop supervision to reliably analyze failure instances. Through extensive experiments and human inspections, we reveal three fundamental vulnerabilities: spurious correlations, contradictory knowledge, and constrained generalization, that limit LLMs in effectively supporting CTI. Subsequently, we provide actionable insights for designing more robust LLM-powered CTI systems to facilitate future research.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Counterfactual reasoning, a hallmark of intelligence, consists of three steps: inferring latent variables from observations (abduction), constructing alternatives (interventions), and predicting their outcomes (prediction). This skill is essential for advancing LLMs' causal understanding and expanding their applications in high-stakes domains such as scientific research. However, existing efforts in assessing LLM's counterfactual reasoning capabilities tend to skip the abduction step, effectively reducing to interventional reasoning and leading to overestimation of LLM performance. To address this, we introduce executable counterfactuals, a novel framework that operationalizes causal reasoning through code and math problems. Our framework explicitly requires all three steps of counterfactual reasoning and enables scalable synthetic data creation with varying difficulty, creating a frontier for evaluating and improving LLM's reasoning. Our results reveal substantial drop in accuracy (25-40%) from interventional to counterfactual reasoning for SOTA models like o4-mini and Claude-4-Sonnet. To address this gap, we construct a training set comprising counterfactual code problems having if-else condition and test on out-of-domain code structures (e.g. having while-loop); we also test whether a model trained on code would generalize to counterfactual math word problems. While supervised finetuning on stronger models' reasoning traces improves in-domain performance of Qwen models, it leads to a decrease in accuracy on OOD tasks such as counterfactual math problems. In contrast, reinforcement learning induces the core cognitive behaviors and generalizes to new domains, yielding gains over the base model on both code (improvement of 1.5x-2x) and math problems. Analysis of the reasoning traces reinforces these findings and highlights the promise of RL for improving LLMs' counterfactual reasoning.

      High-assurance reasoning, particularly in critical domains such as law and medicine, requires conclusions that are accurate, verifiable, and explicitly grounded in evidence. This reasoning relies on premises codified from rules, statutes, and contracts, inherently involving defeasible or non-monotonic logic due to numerous exceptions, where the introduction of a single fact can invalidate general rules, posing significant challenges. While large language models (LLMs) excel at processing natural language, their capabilities in standard inference tasks do not translate to the rigorous reasoning required over high-assurance text guidelines. Core reasoning challenges within such texts often manifest specific logical structures involving negation, implication, and, most critically, defeasible rules and exceptions. In this paper, we propose a novel neurosymbolically-grounded architecture called LOGicalThought (LogT) that uses an advanced logical language and reasoner in conjunction with an LLM to construct a dual symbolic graph context and logic-based context. These two context representations transform the problem from inference over long-form guidelines into a compact grounded evaluation. Evaluated on four multi-domain benchmarks against four baselines, LogT improves overall performance by 11.84% across all LLMs. Performance improves significantly across all three modes of reasoning: by up to +10.2% on negation, +13.2% on implication, and +5.5% on defeasible reasoning compared to the strongest baseline.

      Large language model (LLM) scaling inference is key to unlocking greater performance, and leveraging diversity has proven an effective way to enhance it. Motivated by the observed relationship between solution accuracy and meaningful response diversity, we systematically study the effect of prompt diversity in scaling inference. We theoretically explain why diversified sampling improves Best-of-$N$ scaling, showing that responses generated from meaningful diverse prompts after Best-of-$N$ selection exhibit significantly lower error rates than those produced from stationary prompts. To promote solution diversity, we analyze perturbation fidelity and show that moderately relevant perturbations improve performance, providing guidance for effective perturbation design. Further, we present a set of effective perturbations, including task-level and query-level ones, and analyze the conditions under which they succeed. We systematically evaluate diversified sampling across tasks, finding relative gains of 10.8% in EM@100 for reasoning, 9.6% for mathematics, and 9.5% in Pass@100 for code generation.

      Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) remain a fundamental obstacle to trustworthy AI, particularly in high-stakes multimodal domains such as medicine, law, and finance. Existing evaluation techniques are largely heuristic -- anchored in qualitative benchmarking or ad-hoc empirical mitigation -- providing neither principled quantification nor actionable theoretical guarantees. This gap leaves a critical blind spot in understanding how hallucinations arise, propagate, and interact across modalities. We introduce the first (to our knowledge) rigorous information geometric framework in diffusion dynamics for quantifying hallucinations in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), advancing the field from qualitative detection to mathematically grounded measurement. Our approach represents MLLM outputs as the spectral embeddings over multimodal graph Laplacians and characterizes the manifold gaps of truth vs inconsistencies as the semantic distortion, enabling the tight Rayleigh--Ritz bounds on the multimodal hallucination energy as a functional of time-dependent temperature profiles. By leveraging eigenmode decompositions in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) embeddings, our framework delivers modality-aware, theoretically interpretable metrics that capture the evolution of hallucinations across time and input prompts through temperature annealing. This work establishes a principled foundation for quantifying and bounding hallucinations, transforming them from a qualitative risk to a tractable, analyzable phenomenon.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have become critical to modern software development, but their reliance on uncurated web-scale datasets for training introduces a significant security risk: the absorption and reproduction of malicious content. To systematically evaluate this risk, we introduce Scam2Prompt, a scalable automated auditing framework that identifies the underlying intent of a scam site and then synthesizes innocuous, developer-style prompts that mirror this intent, allowing us to test whether an LLM will generate malicious code in response to these innocuous prompts. In a large-scale study of four production LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Llama-4-Scout, and DeepSeek-V3), we found that Scam2Prompt's innocuous prompts triggered malicious URL generation in 4.24% of cases. To test the persistence of this security risk, we constructed Innoc2Scam-bench, a benchmark of 1,559 innocuous prompts that consistently elicited malicious code from all four initial LLMs. When applied to seven additional production LLMs released in 2025, we found the vulnerability is not only present but severe, with malicious code generation rates ranging from 12.7% to 43.8%. Furthermore, existing safety measures like state-of-the-art guardrails proved insufficient to prevent this behavior, with an overall detection rate of less than 0.3%.

      Type inference is crucial for reusing online code snippets. Although snippets are prevalently shared on platforms like StackOverflow, they often lack essential type information, such as fully qualified names (FQNs). Recent studies have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform type inference for such code snippets, showing promising results. However, these results may suffer from data leakage, as the benchmark, StatType-SO, used for evaluation has been publicly available on GitHub since 2017. Consequently, it remains uncertain whether the strong performance of LLMs reflects genuine semantic understanding of code or is due to the ground truth being included in the training set. This paper strives to comprehensively evaluate the genuine type inference capabilities of LLMs on Java code snippets and identify potential limitations of LLMs. First, we created ThaliaType, a new, previously unreleased benchmark suite designed for type inference evaluation. Second, using the StarCoder2 LLM as baseline, we uncovered data leakage from StatType-SO in StarCoder2's open-source training set and observed that other state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit similar performance drops when evaluated on ThaliaType, with precision decreasing by up to 59% and recall by up to 72%. Finally, we designed semantic-preserving code transformations to test the capabilities of LLMs in understanding the execution semantics of snippets. Results showed that LLMs' performance on StatType-SO is far less robust to these transformations than on ThaliaType, suggesting that the performance on StatType-SO may be biased by data leakage and have limited generalizability. These findings highlight the importance of carefully designed, leakage-free benchmarks for evaluating LLMs on type inference tasks. We recommend future studies adopt ThaliaType for rigorous and reliable assessments of LLMs' genuine type inference capabilities.

      As LLMs increasingly power agents that interact with external tools, tool use has become an essential mechanism for extending their capabilities. These agents typically select tools from growing databases or marketplaces to solve user tasks, creating implicit competition among tool providers and developers for visibility and usage. In this paper, we show that this selection process harbors a critical vulnerability: by iteratively manipulating tool names and descriptions, adversaries can systematically bias agents toward selecting specific tools, gaining unfair advantage over equally capable alternatives. We present ToolTweak, a lightweight automatic attack that increases selection rates from a baseline of around 20% to as high as 81%, with strong transferability between open-source and closed-source models. Beyond individual tools, we show that such attacks cause distributional shifts in tool usage, revealing risks to fairness, competition, and security in emerging tool ecosystems. To mitigate these risks, we evaluate two defenses: paraphrasing and perplexity filtering, which reduce bias and lead agents to select functionally similar tools more equally. All code will be open-sourced upon acceptance.

      Reinforcement learning improves LLM reasoning, yet sparse delayed reward over long sequences makes token-level credit assignment the key bottleneck. We study the verifiable-reward setting, where the final answer is checkable and multiple responses can be drawn per prompt. Reasoning tasks in math and medical QA align with this setup, where only a few decision tokens significantly impact the outcome. PPO offers token-level advantages with a learned value model, but it is complex to train both the actor and critic models simultaneously, and it is not easily generalizable, as the token-level values from the critic model can make training prone to overfitting. GRPO is critic-free and supports verifiable rewards, but spreads a single sequence-level return across tokens and ignores branching. We introduce \textbf{Prefix-to-Tree (P2T)}, a simple procedure that converts a group of responses into a prefix tree and computes \emph{nonparametric} prefix values \(V(s)\) by aggregating descendant outcomes. Built on P2T, we propose \textbf{TEMPO} (\emph{\textbf{T}ree-\textbf{E}stimated \textbf{M}ean Prefix Value for \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization}), a critic-free algorithm that augments the group-relative outcome signal of GRPO with \emph{branch-gated} temporal-difference corrections derived from the tree. At non-branch tokens, the temporal-difference (TD) term is zero, so TEMPO reduces to GRPO; at branching tokens, it supplies precise token-level credit without a learned value network or extra judges/teachers. On Qwen3-1.7B/4B, TEMPO outperforms PPO and GRPO on in-distribution (MATH, MedQA) and out-of-distribution (GSM-HARD, AMC23, MedMCQA, MMLU-Medical) benchmarks, and reaches higher validation accuracy with roughly the same wall-clock time.

      Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools are integral to modern software development, yet their adoption is undermined by excessive false positives that weaken developer trust and demand costly manual triage. We present ZeroFalse, a framework that integrates static analysis with large language models (LLMs) to reduce false positives while preserving coverage. ZeroFalse treats static analyzer outputs as structured contracts, enriching them with flow-sensitive traces, contextual evidence, and CWE-specific knowledge before adjudication by an LLM. This design preserves the systematic reach of static analysis while leveraging the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. We evaluate ZeroFalse across both benchmarks and real-world projects using ten state-of-the-art LLMs. Our best-performing models achieve F1-scores of 0.912 on the OWASP Java Benchmark and 0.955 on the OpenVuln dataset, maintaining recall and precision above 90%. Results further show that CWE-specialized prompting consistently outperforms generic prompts, and reasoning-oriented LLMs provide the most reliable precision-recall balance. These findings position ZeroFalse as a practical and scalable approach for enhancing the reliability of SAST and supporting its integration into real-world CI/CD pipelines.

Unlike prior health benchmarks that are either generic, clinician-facing or focused on clinical tasks (e.g., diagnosis, triage), DM-Bench introduces a comprehensive evaluation framework tailored to the unique challenges of prototyping patient-facing AI solutions in diabetes, glucose management, metabolic health and related domains. Our benchmark encompasses 7 distinct task categories, reflecting the breadth of real-world questions individuals with diabetes ask, including basic glucose interpretation, educational queries, behavioral associations, advanced decision making and long term planning. Towards this end, we compile a rich dataset comprising one month of time-series data encompassing glucose traces and metrics from continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and behavioral logs (e.g., eating and activity patterns) from 15,000 individuals across three different diabetes populations (type 1, type 2, pre-diabetes/general health and wellness). Using this data, we generate a total of 360,600 personalized, contextual questions across the 7 tasks. We evaluate model performance on these tasks across 5 metrics: accuracy, groundedness, safety, clarity and actionability. Our analysis of 8 recent LLMs reveals substantial variability across tasks and metrics; no single model consistently outperforms others across all dimensions. By establishing this benchmark, we aim to advance the reliability, safety, effectiveness and practical utility of AI solutions in diabetes care.

      Natural language descriptions of optimization or satisfaction problems are challenging to translate into correct MiniZinc models, as this process demands both logical reasoning and constraint programming expertise. We introduce Gala, a framework that addresses this challenge with a global agentic approach: multiple specialized large language model (LLM) agents decompose the modeling task by global constraint type. Each agent is dedicated to detecting and generating code for a specific class of global constraint, while a final assembler agent integrates these constraint snippets into a complete MiniZinc model. By dividing the problem into smaller, well-defined sub-tasks, each LLM handles a simpler reasoning challenge, potentially reducing overall complexity. We conduct initial experiments with several LLMs and show better performance against baselines such as one-shot prompting and chain-of-thought prompting. Finally, we outline a comprehensive roadmap for future work, highlighting potential enhancements and directions for improvement.

      When asked to explain their decisions, LLMs can often give explanations which sound plausible to humans. But are these explanations faithful, i.e. do they convey the factors actually responsible for the decision? In this work, we analyse counterfactual faithfulness across 75 models from 13 families. We analyze the tradeoff between conciseness and comprehensiveness, how correlational faithfulness metrics assess this tradeoff, and the extent to which metrics can be gamed. This analysis motivates two new metrics: the phi-CCT, a simplified variant of the Correlational Counterfactual Test (CCT) which avoids the need for token probabilities while explaining most of the variance of the original test; and F-AUROC, which eliminates sensitivity to imbalanced intervention distributions and captures a model's ability to produce explanations with different levels of detail. Our findings reveal a clear scaling trend: larger and more capable models are consistently more faithful on all metrics we consider.

      Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a highly efficient framework for finetuning the weights of large foundation models, and has become the go-to method for data-driven customization of LLMs. Despite the promise of highly customized behaviors and capabilities, switching between relevant LoRAs in a multiturn setting is inefficient, as the key-value (KV) cache of the entire turn history must be recomputed with the LoRA weights before generation can begin. To address this problem, we propose Activated LoRA (aLoRA), an adapter architecture which modifies the LoRA framework to only adapt weights for the tokens in the sequence after the aLoRA is invoked. This change crucially allows aLoRA to accept the base model's KV cache of the input string, meaning that aLoRA can be instantly activated whenever needed in a chain without recomputing the prior keys and values. This enables building what we call intrinsics, i.e. specialized models invoked to perform well-defined operations on portions of an input chain or conversation that otherwise uses the base model by default. We train a set of aLoRA-based intrinsics models, demonstrating competitive accuracy with standard LoRA while significantly improving inference efficiency. We contributed our Activated LoRA implementation to the Huggingface PEFT library https://github.com/huggingface/peft.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) require significant GPU memory when processing long texts, with the key value (KV) cache consuming up to 70\% of total memory during inference. Although existing compression methods reduce memory by evaluating the importance of individual tokens, they overlook critical semantic relationships between tokens, resulting in fragmented context and degraded performance. We introduce ChunkKV, which fundamentally reimagines KV cache compression by treating semantic chunks - rather than isolated tokens - as basic compression units. This approach preserves complete linguistic structures and contextual integrity, ensuring that essential meaning is retained even under aggressive compression. Our innovation includes a novel layer-wise index reuse technique that exploits the higher cross-layer similarity of preserved indices in ChunkKV, reducing computational overhead and improving throughput by 26.5\%. Comprehensive evaluations on challenging benchmarks: LongBench, Needle-In-A-HayStack, GSM8K, and JailbreakV demonstrate that ChunkKV outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 8.7\% in precision while maintaining the same compression ratio. These results confirm that semantic-aware compression significantly enhances both efficiency and performance for long-context LLM inference, providing a simple yet effective solution to the memory bottleneck problem.

In light of these challenges,we introduce Litespark, a novel pre-training framework that addresses these inefficiencies through targeted optimizations to transformer attention and MLP layers. Our approach combines architectural improvements with algorithmic enhancements to maximize Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) while maintaining compatibility with standard transformer implementations. Comprehensive benchmarking on 3B and 30B parameter Llama models using the SlimPajama-627B dataset demonstrates substantial performance gains: 2x-6x training throughput improvement and $55\%-83$% energy consumption reduction across multi-node H200 GPU clusters. These optimizations are model- and hardware-agnostic, enabling broad applicability across transformer architectures and extending to post-training phases including supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization.

We introduce BrowserArena, a live open-web agent evaluation platform that collects user-submitted tasks, runs Arena-style head-to-head comparisons, and uses step-level human feedback to surface failure modes. Collecting and analyzing step-level annotations on the agent traces, we identify three consistent failure modes: captcha resolution, pop-up banner removal, and direct navigation to URLs. By constructing targeted datasets to further study these tasks, we discover variations in how different language models navigate these failure modes. We find, for example, that o4-mini deploys a wider variety of strategies to circumvent captcha resolution than other models and DeepSeek-R1 consistently misleads users about captcha resolution. Our findings surface both the diversity and brittleness of current web agents. More broadly, our benchmarking methodology provides an approach to evaluating and understanding web agent failure modes at scale.

      In arena-style evaluation of large language models (LLMs), two LLMs respond to a user query, and the user chooses the winning response or deems the "battle" a draw, resulting in an adjustment to the ratings of both models. The prevailing approach for modeling these rating dynamics is to view battles as two-player game matches, as in chess, and apply the Elo rating system and its derivatives. In this paper, we critically examine this paradigm. Specifically, we question whether a draw genuinely means that the two models are equal and hence whether their ratings should be equalized. Instead, we conjecture that draws are more indicative of query difficulty: if the query is too easy, then both models are more likely to succeed equally. On three real-world arena datasets, we show that ignoring rating updates for draws yields a 1-3% relative increase in battle outcome prediction accuracy (which includes draws) for all four rating systems studied. Further analyses suggest that draws occur more for queries rated as very easy and those as highly objective, with risk ratios of 1.37 and 1.35, respectively. We recommend future rating systems to reconsider existing draw semantics and to account for query properties in rating updates.

The limited resource for low-resource languages remains a crucial challenge. Code-switching (CS), a phenomenon where multilingual speakers alternate between languages in a discourse, can convey subtle cultural and linguistic nuances that can be otherwise lost in translation and elicits language-specific knowledge in human communications. In light of this, we investigate whether code-switching can activate, or identify and leverage knowledge for reasoning when LLMs solve low-resource language tasks. To facilitate the research, we first present EnKoQA, a synthetic English-Korean CS question-answering dataset. We provide comprehensive analysis on a variety of multilingual LLMs by subdividing activation process into knowledge identification and knowledge leveraging. Our results demonstrate that compared to English text, CS can faithfully activate knowledge inside LLMs especially on language-specific domains, suggesting the potential of code-switching on low-resource language tasks.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities on complex problems using long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they often suffer from overthinking, meaning generating unnecessarily lengthy reasoning steps for simpler problems. This issue may degrade the efficiency of the models and make them difficult to adapt the reasoning depth to the complexity of problems. To address this, we introduce a novel metric Token Entropy Cumulative Average (TECA), which measures the extent of exploration throughout the reasoning process. We further propose a novel reasoning paradigm -- Explore Briefly, Then Decide -- with an associated Cumulative Entropy Regulation (CER) mechanism. This paradigm leverages TECA to help the model dynamically determine the optimal point to conclude its thought process and provide a final answer, thus achieving efficient reasoning. Experimental results across diverse mathematical benchmarks show that our approach substantially mitigates overthinking without sacrificing problem-solving ability. With our thinking paradigm, the average response length decreases by up to 71% on simpler datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in creating a more efficient and adaptive reasoning process.

      Probabilistic reasoning is a key aspect of both human and artificial intelligence that allows for handling uncertainty and ambiguity in decision-making. In this paper, we introduce a new numerical reasoning task under uncertainty for large language models, focusing on estimating the privacy risk of user-generated documents containing privacy-sensitive information. We propose BRANCH, a new LLM methodology that estimates the k-privacy value of a text-the size of the population matching the given information. BRANCH factorizes a joint probability distribution of personal information as random variables. The probability of each factor in a population is estimated separately using a Bayesian network and combined to compute the final k-value. Our experiments show that this method successfully estimates the k-value 73% of the time, a 13% increase compared to o3-mini with chain-of-thought reasoning. We also find that LLM uncertainty is a good indicator for accuracy, as high-variance predictions are 37.47% less accurate on average.

      Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to predict missing triples in knowledge graphs (KGs) by leveraging existing triples and textual information. Recently, generative large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly employed for graph tasks. However, current approaches typically encode graph context in textual form, which fails to fully exploit the potential of LLMs for perceiving and reasoning about graph structures. To address this limitation, we propose DrKGC (Dynamic Subgraph Retrieval-Augmented LLMs for Knowledge Graph Completion). DrKGC employs a flexible lightweight model training strategy to learn structural embeddings and logical rules within the KG. It then leverages a novel bottom-up graph retrieval method to extract a subgraph for each query guided by the learned rules. Finally, a graph convolutional network (GCN) adapter uses the retrieved subgraph to enhance the structural embeddings, which are then integrated into the prompt for effective LLM fine-tuning. Experimental results on two general domain benchmark datasets and two biomedical datasets demonstrate the superior performance of DrKGC. Furthermore, a realistic case study in the biomedical domain highlights its interpretability and practical utility.

      Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities as autonomous agents, showing promise in reasoning, tool use, and sequential decision-making. While prior benchmarks have evaluated LLM agents in domains such as software engineering and scientific discovery, the finance domain remains underexplored, despite its direct relevance to economic value and high-stakes decision-making. Existing financial benchmarks primarily test static knowledge through question answering, but they fall short of capturing the dynamic and iterative nature of trading. To address this gap, we introduce StockBench, a contamination-free benchmark designed to evaluate LLM agents in realistic, multi-month stock trading environments. Agents receive daily market signals -- including prices, fundamentals, and news -- and must make sequential buy, sell, or hold decisions. Performance is assessed using financial metrics such as cumulative return, maximum drawdown, and the Sortino ratio. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary (e.g., GPT-5, Claude-4) and open-weight (e.g., Qwen3, Kimi-K2, GLM-4.5) models shows that while most LLM agents struggle to outperform the simple buy-and-hold baseline, several models demonstrate the potential to deliver higher returns and manage risk more effectively. These findings highlight both the challenges and opportunities in developing LLM-powered financial agents, showing that excelling at static financial knowledge tasks does not necessarily translate into successful trading strategies. We release StockBench as an open-source resource to support reproducibility and advance future research in this domain.

      Code data has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but it remains unclear which aspects of code are most responsible. We investigate this question with a systematic, data-centric framework. We construct parallel instruction datasets in ten programming languages and apply controlled perturbations that selectively disrupt structural or semantic properties of code. We then finetune LLMs from five model families and eight scales on each variant and evaluate their performance on natural language, math, and code tasks. Across 3,331 experiments, our results show that LLMs are more vulnerable to structural perturbations than semantic ones, particularly on math and code tasks. Appropriate abstractions like pseudocode and flowcharts can be as effective as code, while encoding the same information with fewer tokens without adhering to original syntax can often retain or even improve performance. Remarkably, even corrupted code with misleading signals remains competitive when surface-level regularities persist. Finally, syntactic styles also shape task-specific gains with Python favoring natural language reasoning and lower-level languages such as Java and Rust favoring math. Through our systematic framework, we aim to provide insight into how different properties of code influence reasoning and inform the design of training data for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

      Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have upgraded them from sophisticated text generators to autonomous agents capable of cooperation and tool use in multi-agent systems (MAS). However, it remains unclear how disagreements shape collective decision-making. In this paper, we revisit the role of disagreement and argue that general, partially overlapping disagreements prevent premature consensus and expand the explored solution space, while disagreements on task-critical steps can derail collaboration depending on the topology of solution paths. We investigate two collaborative settings with distinct path structures: collaborative reasoning (CounterFact, MQuAKE-cf), which typically follows a single evidential chain, whereas collaborative programming (HumanEval, GAIA) often adopts multiple valid implementations. Disagreements are instantiated as general heterogeneity among agents and as task-critical counterfactual knowledge edits injected into context or parameters. Experiments reveal that general disagreements consistently improve success by encouraging complementary exploration. By contrast, task-critical disagreements substantially reduce success on single-path reasoning, yet have a limited impact on programming, where agents can choose alternative solutions. Trace analyses show that MAS frequently bypasses the edited facts in programming but rarely does so in reasoning, revealing an emergent self-repair capability that depends on solution-path rather than scale alone.

      Recent studies suggest that the deeper layers of Large Language Models (LLMs) contribute little to representation learning and can often be removed without significant performance loss. However, such claims are typically drawn from narrow evaluations and may overlook important aspects of model behavior. In this work, we present a systematic study of depth utilization across diverse dimensions, including evaluation protocols, task categories, and model architectures. Our analysis confirms that very deep layers are generally less effective than earlier ones, but their contributions vary substantially with the evaluation setting. Under likelihood-based metrics without generation, pruning most layers preserves performance, with only the initial few being critical. By contrast, generation-based evaluation uncovers indispensable roles for middle and deeper layers in enabling reasoning and maintaining long-range coherence. We further find that knowledge and retrieval are concentrated in shallow components, whereas reasoning accuracy relies heavily on deeper layers -- yet can be reshaped through distillation. These results highlight that depth usage in LLMs is highly heterogeneous and context-dependent, underscoring the need for task-, metric-, and model-aware perspectives in both interpreting and compressing large models.

      Clinician scheduling remains a persistent challenge due to limited clinical resources and fluctuating demands. This complexity is especially acute in large academic anesthesiology departments as physicians balance responsibilities across multiple clinical sites with conflicting priorities. Further, scheduling must account for individual clinical and lifestyle preferences to ensure job satisfaction and well-being. Traditional approaches, often based on statistical or rule-based optimization models, rely on structured data and explicit domain knowledge. However, these methods often overlook unstructured information, e.g., free-text notes from routinely administered clinician well-being surveys and scheduling platforms. These notes may reveal implicit and underutilized clinical resources. Neglecting such information can lead to misaligned schedules, increased burnout, overlooked staffing flexibility, and suboptimal utilization of available resources. To address this gap, we propose a predict-then-optimize framework that integrates classification-based clinician availability predictions with a mixed-integer programming schedule optimization model. Large language models (LLMs) are employed to extract actionable preferences and implicit constraints from unstructured schedule notes, enhancing the reliability of availability predictions. These predictions then inform the schedule optimization considering four objectives: first, ensuring clinical full-time equivalent compliance, second, reducing workload imbalances by enforcing equitable proportions of shift types, third, maximizing clinician availability for assigned shifts, and fourth, schedule consistency. By combining the interpretive power of LLMs with the rigor of mathematical optimization, our framework provides a robust, data-driven solution that enhances operational efficiency while supporting equity and clinician well-being.

      Machine unlearning techniques aim to mitigate unintended memorization in large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches predominantly focus on the explicit removal of isolated facts, often overlooking latent inferential dependencies and the non-deterministic nature of knowledge within LLMs. Consequently, facts presumed forgotten may persist implicitly through correlated information. To address these challenges, we propose a knowledge unlearning evaluation framework that more accurately captures the implicit structure of real-world knowledge by representing relevant factual contexts as knowledge graphs with associated confidence scores. We further develop an inference-based evaluation protocol leveraging powerful LLMs as judges; these judges reason over the extracted knowledge subgraph to determine unlearning success. Our LLM judges utilize carefully designed prompts and are calibrated against human evaluations to ensure their trustworthiness and stability. Extensive experiments on our newly constructed benchmark demonstrate that our framework provides a more realistic and rigorous assessment of unlearning performance. Moreover, our findings reveal that current evaluation strategies tend to overestimate unlearning effectiveness.

      Understanding the emotions in a dialogue usually requires external knowledge to accurately understand the contents. As the LLMs become more and more powerful, we do not want to settle on the limited ability of the pre-trained language model. However, the LLMs either can only process text modality or are too expensive to process the multimedia information. We aim to utilize both the power of LLMs and the supplementary features from the multimedia modalities. In this paper, we present a framework, Lantern, that can improve the performance of a certain vanilla model by prompting large language models with receptive-field-aware attention weighting. This framework trained a multi-task vanilla model to produce probabilities of emotion classes and dimension scores. These predictions are fed into the LLMs as references to adjust the predicted probabilities of each emotion class with its external knowledge and contextual understanding. We slice the dialogue into different receptive fields, and each sample is included in exactly t receptive fields. Finally, the predictions of LLMs are merged with a receptive-field-aware attention-driven weighting module. In the experiments, vanilla models CORECT and SDT are deployed in Lantern with GPT-4 or Llama-3.1-405B. The experiments in IEMOCAP with 4-way and 6-way settings demonstrated that the Lantern can significantly improve the performance of current vanilla models by up to 1.23% and 1.80%.

      Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in natural language to SQL (NL2SQL) tasks within general databases. However, extending to GeoSQL introduces additional complexity from spatial data types, function invocation, and coordinate systems, which greatly increases generation and execution difficulty. Existing benchmarks mainly target general SQL, and a systematic evaluation framework for GeoSQL is still lacking. To fill this gap, we present GeoSQL-Eval, the first end-to-end automated evaluation framework for PostGIS query generation, together with GeoSQL-Bench, a benchmark for assessing LLM performance in NL2GeoSQL tasks. GeoSQL-Bench defines three task categories-conceptual understanding, syntax-level SQL generation, and schema retrieval-comprising 14,178 instances, 340 PostGIS functions, and 82 thematic databases. GeoSQL-Eval is grounded in Webb's Depth of Knowledge (DOK) model, covering four cognitive dimensions, five capability levels, and twenty task types to establish a comprehensive process from knowledge acquisition and syntax generation to semantic alignment, execution accuracy, and robustness. We evaluate 24 representative models across six categories and apply the entropy weight method with statistical analyses to uncover performance differences, common error patterns, and resource usage. Finally, we release a public GeoSQL-Eval leaderboard platform for continuous testing and global comparison. This work extends the NL2GeoSQL paradigm and provides a standardized, interpretable, and extensible framework for evaluating LLMs in spatial database contexts, offering valuable references for geospatial information science and related applications.

      Zeroth-order optimizers have recently emerged as a practical approach for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), significantly reducing GPU memory consumption compared to traditional first-order methods. Yet, existing zeroth-order methods rely on hand-crafted, static sampling strategies that are not adaptable to model-specific structures. To address this, we propose ZO Fine-tuner, a learning-based zeroth-order optimizer for LLMs that automatically learns efficient perturbation strategies through a compact and memory-efficient design. Crucially, our approach is motivated by the observation that only a small number of foundation models and their derivatives are widely adopted in practice. Therefore, learning the optimizer once for a given LLM and reusing it across diverse downstream tasks is both feasible and highly desirable. Accordingly, ZO Fine-tuner is designed to scale learning to learn (L2L) to the foundation-model era by supporting one-time training per LLM with minimal overhead. Experiments on 4 LLMs and 7 datasets show that ZO Fine-tuner outperforms prior zeroth-order baselines in 82.1\% of task-model combinations, thereby demonstrating strong performance and scalability for efficient LLM fine-tuning.

      We draw inspiration from microsaccades, tiny involuntary eye movements that reveal hidden dynamics of human perception, to propose an analogous probing method for large language models (LLMs). Just as microsaccades expose subtle but informative shifts in vision, we show that lightweight position encoding perturbations elicit latent signals that indicate model misbehaviour. Our method requires no fine-tuning or task-specific supervision, yet detects failures across diverse settings including factuality, safety, toxicity, and backdoor attacks. Experiments on multiple state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that these perturbation-based probes surface misbehaviours while remaining computationally efficient. These findings suggest that pretrained LLMs already encode the internal evidence needed to flag their own failures, and that microsaccade-inspired interventions provide a pathway for detecting and mitigating undesirable behaviours.

      Embodied agents operating in household environments must interpret ambiguous and under-specified human instructions. A capable household robot should recognize ambiguity and ask relevant clarification questions to infer the user intent accurately, leading to more effective task execution. To study this problem, we introduce the Ask-to-Act task, where an embodied agent is tasked with a single or multi-object rearrangement task using an under-specified instruction in a home environment. The agent must strategically ask minimal, yet relevant, clarification questions to resolve ambiguity while navigating under partial observability. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that fine-tunes multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) as vision-language-action (VLA) policies using online reinforcement learning (RL) with LLM-generated rewards. Our method eliminates the need for large-scale human demonstrations or manually engineered rewards for training such agents. We benchmark against strong zero-shot baselines including GPT-4o as well as supervised fine-tuned MLLMs on our task. Our results show that our RL-finetuned MLLM outperforms all baselines by a significant margin (10.4-16.5%), generalizing well to novel scenes and tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of adapting MLLMs as VLA agents that can act and ask for help using LLM-generated rewards with online RL.

      Prompt injection attacks represent a major vulnerability in Large Language Model (LLM) deployments, where malicious instructions embedded in user inputs can override system prompts and induce unintended behaviors. This paper presents a novel multi-agent defense framework that employs specialized LLM agents in coordinated pipelines to detect and neutralize prompt injection attacks in real-time. We evaluate our approach using two distinct architectures: a sequential chain-of-agents pipeline and a hierarchical coordinator-based system. Our comprehensive evaluation on 55 unique prompt injection attacks, grouped into 8 categories and totaling 400 attack instances across two LLM platforms (ChatGLM and Llama2), demonstrates significant security improvements. Without defense mechanisms, baseline Attack Success Rates (ASR) reached 30% for ChatGLM and 20% for Llama2. Our multi-agent pipeline achieved 100% mitigation, reducing ASR to 0% across all tested scenarios. The framework demonstrates robustness across multiple attack categories including direct overrides, code execution attempts, data exfiltration, and obfuscation techniques, while maintaining system functionality for legitimate queries.

      As cyber threats continue to grow in scale and sophistication, blue team defenders increasingly require advanced tools to proactively detect and mitigate risks. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for enhancing threat analysis. However, their effectiveness in real-world blue team threat-hunting scenarios remains insufficiently explored. This paper presents CyberTeam, a benchmark designed to guide LLMs in blue teaming practice. CyberTeam constructs a standardized workflow in two stages. First, it models realistic threat-hunting workflows by capturing the dependencies among analytical tasks from threat attribution to incident response. Next, each task is addressed through a set of operational modules tailored to its specific analytical requirements. This transforms threat hunting into a structured sequence of reasoning steps, with each step grounded in a discrete operation and ordered according to task-specific dependencies. Guided by this framework, LLMs are directed to perform threat-hunting tasks through modularized steps. Overall, CyberTeam integrates 30 tasks and 9 operational modules to guide LLMs through standardized threat analysis. We evaluate both leading LLMs and state-of-the-art cybersecurity agents, comparing CyberTeam against open-ended reasoning strategies. Our results highlight the improvements enabled by standardized design, while also revealing the limitations of open-ended reasoning in real-world threat hunting.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are intensively used to assist security analysts in counteracting the rapid exploitation of cyber threats, wherein LLMs offer cyber threat intelligence (CTI) to support vulnerability assessment and incident response. While recent work has shown that LLMs can support a wide range of CTI tasks such as threat analysis, vulnerability detection, and intrusion defense, significant performance gaps persist in practical deployments. In this paper, we investigate the intrinsic vulnerabilities of LLMs in CTI, focusing on challenges that arise from the nature of the threat landscape itself rather than the model architecture. Using large-scale evaluations across multiple CTI benchmarks and real-world threat reports, we introduce a novel categorization methodology that integrates stratification, autoregressive refinement, and human-in-the-loop supervision to reliably analyze failure instances. Through extensive experiments and human inspections, we reveal three fundamental vulnerabilities: spurious correlations, contradictory knowledge, and constrained generalization, that limit LLMs in effectively supporting CTI. Subsequently, we provide actionable insights for designing more robust LLM-powered CTI systems to facilitate future research.

      Insider threats are a growing organizational problem due to the complexity of identifying their technical and behavioral elements. A large research body is dedicated to the study of insider threats from technological, psychological, and educational perspectives. However, research in this domain has been generally dependent on datasets that are static and limited access which restricts the development of adaptive detection models. This study introduces a novel, ethically grounded approach that uses the large language model (LLM) Claude Sonnet 3.7 to dynamically synthesize syslog messages, some of which contain indicators of insider threat scenarios. The messages reflect real-world data distributions by being highly imbalanced (1% insider threats). The syslogs were analyzed for insider threats by both Sonnet 3.7 and GPT-4o, with their performance evaluated through statistical metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1, specificity, FAR, MCC, and ROC AUC. Sonnet 3.7 consistently outperformed GPT-4o across nearly all metrics, particularly in reducing false alarms and improving detection accuracy. The results show strong promise for the use of LLMs in synthetic dataset generation and insider threat detection.

      Ambiguity in natural language is a significant obstacle for achieving accurate text to structured data mapping through large language models (LLMs), which affects the performance of tasks such as mapping text to agentic tool calling and text-to-SQL queries. Existing methods to ambiguity handling either rely on the ReACT framework to obtain correct mappings through trial and error, or on supervised fine-tuning to bias models toward specific tasks. In this paper, we adopt a different approach that characterizes representation differences of ambiguous text in the latent space and leverages these differences to identify ambiguity before mapping them to structured data. To detect sentence-level ambiguity, we focus on the relationship between ambiguous questions and their interpretations. Unlike distances calculated by dense embeddings, we introduce a new distance measure based on a path kernel over concepts. With this measurement, we identify patterns to distinguish ambiguous from unambiguous questions. Furthermore, we propose a method for improving LLM performance on ambiguous agentic tool calling through missing concept prediction. Both achieve state-of-the-art results.

      Watermarking for large language models (LLMs) embeds a statistical signal during generation to enable detection of model-produced text. While watermarking has proven effective in benign settings, its robustness under adversarial evasion remains contested. To advance a rigorous understanding and evaluation of such vulnerabilities, we propose the \emph{Bias-Inversion Rewriting Attack} (BIRA), which is theoretically motivated and model-agnostic. BIRA weakens the watermark signal by suppressing the logits of likely watermarked tokens during LLM-based rewriting, without any knowledge of the underlying watermarking scheme. Across recent watermarking methods, BIRA achieves over 99\% evasion while preserving the semantic content of the original text. Beyond demonstrating an attack, our results reveal a systematic vulnerability, emphasizing the need for stress testing and robust defenses.

      As Large Language Model (LLM) agents become more widespread, associated misalignment risks increase. While prior research has studied agents' ability to produce harmful outputs or follow malicious instructions, it remains unclear how likely agents are to spontaneously pursue unintended goals in realistic deployments. In this work, we approach misalignment as a conflict between the internal goals pursued by the model and the goals intended by its deployer. We introduce a misalignment propensity benchmark, \textsc{AgentMisalignment}, a benchmark suite designed to evaluate the propensity of LLM agents to misalign in realistic scenarios. Evaluations cover behaviours such as avoiding oversight, resisting shutdown, sandbagging, and power-seeking. Testing frontier models, we find that more capable agents tend to exhibit higher misalignment on average. We also systematically vary agent personalities through different system prompts and observe that persona characteristics can strongly and unpredictably influence misalignment, sometimes more than the choice of model itself. Our results reveal the limitations of current alignment methods for autonomous LLM agents and underscore the need to rethink misalignment in realistic deployment settings.

      Performing complex manipulation tasks in dynamic environments requires efficient Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) approaches that combine high-level symbolic plans with low-level motion control. Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, are transforming task planning by offering natural language as an intuitive and flexible way to describe tasks, generate symbolic plans, and reason. However, the effectiveness of LLM-based TAMP approaches is limited due to static and template-based prompting, which limits adaptability to dynamic environments and complex task contexts. To address these limitations, this work proposes a novel Onto-LLM-TAMP framework that employs knowledge-based reasoning to refine and expand user prompts with task-contextual reasoning and knowledge-based environment state descriptions. Integrating domain-specific knowledge into the prompt ensures semantically accurate and context-aware task plans. The proposed framework demonstrates its effectiveness by resolving semantic errors in symbolic plan generation, such as maintaining logical temporal goal ordering in scenarios involving hierarchical object placement. The proposed framework is validated through both simulation and real-world scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements over the baseline approach in terms of adaptability to dynamic environments and the generation of semantically correct task plans.

      Large language models (LLMs) are often modified after release through post-processing such as post-training or quantization, which makes it challenging to determine whether one model is derived from another. Existing provenance detection methods have two main limitations: (1) they embed signals into the base model before release, which is infeasible for already published models, or (2) they compare outputs across models using hand-crafted or random prompts, which are not robust to post-processing. In this work, we propose LLMPrint, a novel detection framework that constructs fingerprints by exploiting LLMs' inherent vulnerability to prompt injection. Our key insight is that by optimizing fingerprint prompts to enforce consistent token preferences, we can obtain fingerprints that are both unique to the base model and robust to post-processing. We further develop a unified verification procedure that applies to both gray-box and black-box settings, with statistical guarantees. We evaluate LLMPrint on five base models and around 700 post-trained or quantized variants. Our results show that LLMPrint achieves high true positive rates while keeping false positive rates near zero.

      Quantizing the weights of large language models (LLMs) from 16-bit to lower bitwidth is the de facto approach to deploy massive transformers onto more affordable accelerators. While GPTQ emerged as one of the standard methods for one-shot post-training quantization at LLM scale, its inner workings are described as a sequence of ad-hoc algebraic updates that obscure geometric meaning or worst-case guarantees. In this work, we show that, when executed back-to-front (from the last to first dimension) for a linear layer, GPTQ is mathematically identical to Babai's nearest plane algorithm for the classical closest vector problem (CVP) on a lattice defined by the Hessian matrix of the layer's inputs. This equivalence is based on a sophisticated mathematical argument, and has two analytical consequences: first, the GPTQ error propagation step gains an intuitive geometric interpretation; second, GPTQ inherits the error upper bound of Babai's algorithm under the assumption that no weights are clipped. Leveraging this bound, we design post-training quantization methods that avoid clipping, and outperform the original GPTQ. In addition, we provide efficient GPU inference kernels for the resulting representation. Taken together, these results place GPTQ on a firm theoretical footing and open the door to importing decades of progress in lattice algorithms towards the design of future quantization algorithms for billion-parameter models.

      Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) are gaining attention for their inherent capacity for parallel decoding, offering a compelling alternative to autoregressive LLMs. Among various decoding strategies, blockwise semi-autoregressive (semi-AR) approaches are widely adopted due to their natural support for KV caching and their favorable accuracy-speed trade-off. However, this paper identifies two fundamental limitations in the conventional semi-AR decoding approach that applies a fixed block size: i) late decoding overhead, where the unmasking of high-confidence tokens outside the current block is unnecessarily delayed, and ii) premature decoding error, where low-confidence tokens inside the current block are committed too early, leading to incorrect tokens. This paper presents the first systematic investigation challenging the fixed block size assumption in semi-AR decoding. Through a statistical analysis of confidence dynamics during the denoising process, we identify a volatility band (VB) region during dLLM decoding, which encodes local semantic structure and can be used to guide adaptive block sizing. Leveraging these insights, we introduce AdaBlock-dLLM, a training-free, plug-and-play scheduler that adaptively aligns block boundaries with semantic steps by adjusting block size during runtime. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks show that AdaBlock-dLLM achieves up to 5.3% accuracy improvement under the same throughput budget. Beyond inference-time optimization, we hope our semantics-aware adaptive scheduling approach and confidence-based analysis will inspire future training strategies for dLLMs.

However, using a different vocabulary often leads to a degradation of learned knowledge since many words are initially out-of-vocabulary (OOV) when training starts. Inspired by the vocabulary learning during Second Language (Arabic) Acquisition for humans, the released AraLLaMA employs progressive vocabulary expansion, which is implemented by a modified BPE algorithm that progressively extends the Arabic subwords in its dynamic vocabulary during training, thereby balancing the OOV ratio at every stage. The ablation study demonstrated the effectiveness of Progressive Vocabulary Expansion. Moreover, AraLLaMA achieves decent performance comparable to the best Arabic LLMs across a variety of Arabic benchmarks. Models, training data, benchmarks, and codes will be all open-sourced.

      LLM inference serving typically scales out with a two-tier architecture: a cluster router distributes requests to multiple inference engines, each of which then in turn performs its own internal scheduling. However, this commonly used paradigm suffers from critical, systemic inefficiency caused by the information gaps across two layers. At the cluster-layer, the router mainly relies on lagging, coarse-grained metrics, such as average latency and queue length to make decisions, resulting in "decision lag" that leads to suboptimal request routing. At the engine-layer, static heuristic scheduling policies cannot effectively handle the dynamic workloads, leading a poor balance between latency and throughput. Besides, these gaps may cause SLO violations and resource waste, especially in heterogeneous cloud environments. To bridge such gaps, we propose NexusSched, a cross-layer framework that shifts LLM serving system from reactive load balancing to predictive orchestration. The core of NexusSched lies in a structurally-informed online performance model that provides accurate, forward-looking per-step latency and capacity estimations. This model empowers two key components. At the engine-layer, LENS performs SLO-aware, adaptive scheduling, dynamically optimizing batching to meet SLOs under real-time loads. At the cluster-layer, PRISM uses predictive signals to perform state-driven routing, maximizing cluster-wide performance and SLO attainment. Performance evaluations show that NexusSched improves SLO attainment by 43% on average and achieves up to 3x throughput speedup in long-context and heterogeneous scenarios. Besides, we also deploy NexusSched on FlowGPT's clusters to demonstrate its advantages in production environment.

      The use of natural language (NL) test cases for validating graphical user interface (GUI) applications is emerging as a promising direction to manually written executable test scripts, which are costly to develop and difficult to maintain. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened the possibility of the direct execution of NL test cases by LLM agents. This paper investigates this direction, focusing on the impact on NL test case unsoundness and on test case execution consistency. NL test cases are inherently unsound, as they may yield false failures due to ambiguous instructions or unpredictable agent behaviour. Furthermore, repeated executions of the same NL test case may lead to inconsistent outcomes, undermining test reliability. To address these challenges, we propose an algorithm for executing NL test cases with guardrail mechanisms and specialised agents that dynamically verify the correct execution of each test step. We introduce measures to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in test execution and one measure to quantify execution consistency. We propose a definition of weak unsoundness to characterise contexts in which NL test case execution remains acceptable, with respect to the industrial quality levels Six Sigma. Our experimental evaluation with eight publicly available LLMs, ranging from 3B to 70B parameters, demonstrates both the potential and current limitations of current LLM agents for GUI testing. Our experiments show that Meta Llama 3.1 70B demonstrates acceptable capabilities in NL test case execution with high execution consistency (above the level 3-sigma). We provide prototype tools, test suites, and results.

      The prevailing approach to distilling reasoning from Large Language Models (LLMs)-behavioral cloning from textual rationales-is fundamentally limited. It teaches Small Language Models (SLMs) to mimic surface-level patterns rather than the underlying algorithmic structure of thought, resulting in a critical lack of logical robustness. We argue that instead of cloning text, distillation should transfer this algorithmic structure directly. We introduce Reasoning Scaffolding}, a framework that reframes reasoning as a structured generation process. Our method first abstracts the teacher's thought process into a sequence of discrete, interpretable semantic signals (e.g., Contrast, Addition) that act as a scaffold. The student model is then trained via a multi-task objective to both (1)predict the next semantic signal, anticipating the reasoning flow, and (2)generate the corresponding step, conditioned on that signal. This multi-task scheme acts as a powerful regularizer, compelling the student to internalize the computational patterns of coherent reasoning. On a suite of challenging reasoning benchmarks, our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art distillation in both accuracy and logical consistency, providing a path towards creating smaller models that are genuine reasoners, not just fluent mimics.

      We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can generate effective, user-facing explanations from a mathematically interpretable recommendation model. The model is based on constrained matrix factorization, where user types are explicitly represented and predicted item scores share the same scale as observed ratings, making the model's internal representations and predicted scores directly interpretable. This structure is translated into natural language explanations using carefully designed LLM prompts. Many works in explainable AI rely on automatic evaluation metrics, which often fail to capture users' actual needs and perceptions. In contrast, we adopt a user-centered approach: we conduct a study with 326 participants who assessed the quality of the explanations across five key dimensions-transparency, effectiveness, persuasion, trust, and satisfaction-as well as the recommendations themselves. To evaluate how different explanation strategies are perceived, we generate multiple explanation types from the same underlying model, varying the input information provided to the LLM. Our analysis reveals that all explanation types are generally well received, with moderate statistical differences between strategies. User comments further underscore how participants react to each type of explanation, offering complementary insights beyond the quantitative results.

      Classical planners are powerful systems, but modeling tasks in input formats such as PDDL is tedious and error-prone. In contrast, planning with Large Language Models (LLMs) allows for almost any input text, but offers no guarantees on plan quality or even soundness. In an attempt to merge the best of these two approaches, some work has begun to use LLMs to automate parts of the PDDL creation process. However, these methods still require various degrees of expert input or domain-specific adaptations. We present NL2Plan, the first fully automatic system for generating complete PDDL tasks from minimal natural language descriptions. NL2Plan uses an LLM to incrementally extract the necessary information from the short text input before creating a complete PDDL description of both the domain and the problem which is finally solved by a classical planner. We evaluate NL2Plan on seven planning domains, five of which are novel and thus not in the LLM training data, and find that NL2Plan outperforms directly generating the files with an LLM+validator combination. As such, NL2Plan is a powerful tool for assistive PDDL modeling and a step towards solving natural language planning task with interpretability and guarantees.

      Grounding large language models (LLMs) in domain-specific tasks like post-hoc dash-cam driving video analysis is challenging due to their general-purpose training and lack of structured inductive biases. As vision is often the sole modality available for such analysis (i.e., no LiDAR, GPS, etc.), existing video-based vision-language models (V-VLMs) struggle with spatial reasoning, causal inference, and explainability of events in the input video. To this end, we introduce iFinder, a structured semantic grounding framework that decouples perception from reasoning by translating dash-cam videos into a hierarchical, interpretable data structure for LLMs. iFinder operates as a modular, training-free pipeline that employs pretrained vision models to extract critical cues -- object pose, lane positions, and object trajectories -- which are hierarchically organized into frame- and video-level structures. Combined with a three-block prompting strategy, it enables step-wise, grounded reasoning for the LLM to refine a peer V-VLM's outputs and provide accurate reasoning. Evaluations on four public dash-cam video benchmarks show that iFinder's proposed grounding with domain-specific cues, especially object orientation and global context, significantly outperforms end-to-end V-VLMs on four zero-shot driving benchmarks, with up to 39% gains in accident reasoning accuracy. By grounding LLMs with driving domain-specific representations, iFinder offers a zero-shot, interpretable, and reliable alternative to end-to-end V-VLMs for post-hoc driving video understanding.

      Reliable evaluation of large language models is essential to ensure their applicability in practical scenarios. Traditional benchmark-based evaluation methods often rely on fixed reference answers, limiting their ability to capture important qualitative aspects of generated responses. To address these shortcomings, we propose an integrated evaluation framework called \textit{self-refining descriptive evaluation with expert-driven diagnostics}, SPEED, which utilizes specialized functional experts to perform comprehensive, descriptive analyses of model outputs. Unlike conventional approaches, SPEED actively incorporates expert feedback across multiple dimensions, including hallucination detection, toxicity assessment, and lexical-contextual appropriateness. Experimental results demonstrate that SPEED achieves robust and consistent evaluation performance across diverse domains and datasets. Additionally, by employing relatively compact expert models, SPEED demonstrates superior resource efficiency compared to larger-scale evaluators. These findings illustrate that SPEED significantly enhances fairness and interpretability in LLM evaluations, offering a promising alternative to existing evaluation methodologies.

      Controlling diversity in LLM-agent simulations is essential for balancing stability in structured tasks with variability in open-ended interactions. However, we observe that dialogue diversity tends to degrade over long-term simulations. To explore the role of prompt design in this phenomenon, we modularized the utterance generation prompt and found that reducing contextual information leads to more diverse outputs. Based on this insight, we propose Adaptive Prompt Pruning (APP), a novel method that allows users to control diversity via a single parameter, lambda. APP dynamically prunes prompt segments based on attention scores and is compatible with existing diversity control methods. We demonstrate that APP effectively modulates diversity through extensive experiments and propose a method to balance the control trade-offs. Our analysis reveals that all prompt components impose constraints on diversity, with the Memory being the most influential. Additionally, high-attention contents consistently suppress output diversity.

      Although LLMs have achieved remarkable performance, the inherent stochasticity of their reasoning process and varying conclusions present significant challenges. Majority voting or Best-of-N with external verification models has been explored to find the most promising solution among multiple LLM outputs. However, these approaches have certain limitations, such as limited applicability or the cost of an additional training step. To address this problem, we propose a novel and effective framework that Recycles Few-shot examples to verify LLM outputs (ReFeri). Our key idea is to additionally utilize the given few-shot examples to evaluate the candidate outputs of the target query, not only using them to generate outputs as the conventional few-shot prompting setup. Specifically, ReFeri evaluates the generated outputs by combining two different scores, designed motivated from Bayes' rule, and subsequently selects the candidate that is both confidently determined and contextually coherent through a few additional LLM inferences. Experiments with three different LLMs and across seven diverse tasks demonstrate that our framework significantly improves the accuracy of LLMs-achieving an average gain of 4.8%-through effective response selection, without additional training.

      Test-time scaling enables large language models (LLMs) to improve performance on long-horizon reasoning tasks by allocating additional compute at inference. Tree-search-based approaches achieve state-of-the-art results in this setting, but they are notoriously inefficient, often an order of magnitude slower than simpler iterative methods. We introduce Chain-in-Tree (CiT), a plug-in framework that adaptively decides when to branch during search rather than branching at every step. CiT relies on lightweight Branching Necessity (BN) evaluation methods: BN-DP (Direct Prompting), where an auxiliary LLM directly judges whether a step requires branching, and BN-SC (Self-Consistency), which clusters multiple candidate actions to estimate agreement. We integrate CiT into three representative LLM-in-the-loop tree search frameworks: Tree of Thoughts (ToT-BS), ReST-MCTS, and RAP, and evaluate across GSM8K and Math500. Our results show that: (1) BN-DP consistently reduces token generation, model invocations, and runtime by 75-85 percent across all settings, with negligible accuracy loss and sometimes accuracy gains; (2) BN-SC typically yields substantial savings (up to 80 percent) but shows instability in 1-4 out of 14 settings, caused by a small subset of examples that produce very long reasoning steps; (3) the quality of auxiliary LLMs is critical, not only the BN evaluator in BN-DP, but also the models used in BN-SC for clustering and equivalence checking. When these roles are filled by smaller LLMs, performance degrades. Importantly, BN-SC does not require LLMs in domains with deterministic action spaces, where clustering can be done programmatically. We also provide a theoretical guarantee that BN-DP never increases LLM invocations relative to the baseline and release a unified implementation of CiT across ToT-BS, ReST-MCTS, and RAP to facilitate reproducibility and extension.

      Standard human preference-based alignment methods, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), are a cornerstone technology for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values. However, these methods are all underpinned by a critical, yet flawed assumption: human preferences are homogeneous (representing a single, unified preference) and the collected data is noiseless (free from error). In reality, neither is true since human preference is pluralistic and annotators can make mistakes. This creates a discrepancy between the recorded data and the ground-truth preferences, which can misguide the model and degrade its performance. To address this challenge, we introduce Latent Collective Preference Optimization (LCPO). LCPO leverages an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to learn the latent collective consensus from noisy data. It operates by inferring the correctness of each preference label and using this probability as an adaptive weight to re-calibrate each data point's contribution to the training loss, thereby mitigating noise. We generalize this approach by establishing a theoretical link between arbitrary preference losses and their corresponding probabilistic models, elevating LCPO from a specific algorithm to a general framework for robust preference alignment. Theoretically, we prove that under the condition of a perfectly calibrated model, LCPO is guaranteed to converge to the true noise level of the dataset. Our experiments demonstrate LCPO's effectiveness as a general framework, consistently enhancing four state-of-the-art alignment algorithms (DPO, IPO, SimPO, and CPO). When applied to Mistral and Llama 3 models, the LCPO-enhanced methods achieve substantial win rate gains on AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard, with improvements of up to 7.0% on both benchmarks.

      Existing multi-agent learning approaches have developed interactive training environments to explicitly promote collaboration among multiple Large Language Models (LLMs), thereby constructing stronger multi-agent systems (MAS). However, during inference, they require re-executing the MAS to obtain final solutions, which diverges from human cognition that individuals can enhance their reasoning capabilities through interactions with others and resolve questions independently in the future. To investigate whether multi-agent interaction can enhance LLMs' independent problem-solving ability, we introduce ILR, a novel co-learning framework for MAS that integrates two key components: Dynamic Interaction and Perception Calibration. Specifically, Dynamic Interaction first adaptively selects either cooperative or competitive strategies depending on question difficulty and model ability. LLMs then exchange information through Idea3 (Idea Sharing, Idea Analysis, and Idea Fusion), an innovative interaction paradigm designed to mimic human discussion, before deriving their respective final answers. In Perception Calibration, ILR employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to train LLMs while integrating one LLM's reward distribution characteristics into another's reward function, thereby enhancing the cohesion of multi-agent interactions. We validate ILR on three LLMs across two model families of varying scales, evaluating performance on five mathematical benchmarks and one coding benchmark. Experimental results show that ILR consistently outperforms single-agent learning, yielding an improvement of up to 5% over the strongest baseline. We further discover that Idea3 can enhance the robustness of stronger LLMs during multi-agent inference, and dynamic interaction types can boost multi-agent learning compared to pure cooperative or competitive strategies.

      Moral competence is the ability to act in accordance with moral principles. As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in situations demanding moral competence, there is increasing interest in evaluating this ability empirically. We review existing literature and identify three significant shortcoming: (i) Over-reliance on prepackaged moral scenarios with explicitly highlighted moral features; (ii) Focus on verdict prediction rather than moral reasoning; and (iii) Inadequate testing of models' (in)ability to recognize when additional information is needed. Grounded in philosophical research on moral skill, we then introduce a novel method for assessing moral competence in LLMs. Our approach moves beyond simple verdict comparisons to evaluate five dimensions of moral competence: identifying morally relevant features, weighting their importance, assigning moral reasons to these features, synthesizing coherent moral judgments, and recognizing information gaps. We conduct two experiments comparing six leading LLMs against non-expert humans and professional philosophers. In our first experiment using ethical vignettes standard to existing work, LLMs generally outperformed non-expert humans across multiple dimensions of moral reasoning. However, our second experiment, featuring novel scenarios designed to test moral sensitivity by embedding relevant features among irrelevant details, revealed a striking reversal: several LLMs performed significantly worse than humans. Our findings suggest that current evaluations may substantially overestimate LLMs' moral reasoning capabilities by eliminating the task of discerning moral relevance from noisy information, which we take to be a prerequisite for genuine moral skill. This work provides a more nuanced framework for assessing AI moral competence and highlights important directions for improving moral competence in advanced AI systems.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as versatile foundation models for computational chemistry, handling bidirectional tasks like reaction prediction and retrosynthesis. However, these models often lack round-trip consistency. For instance, a state-of-the-art chemical LLM may successfully caption a molecule, yet be unable to accurately reconstruct the original structure from its own generated text. This inconsistency suggests that models are learning unidirectional memorization rather than flexible mastery. Indeed, recent work has demonstrated a strong correlation between a model's round-trip consistency and its performance on the primary tasks. This strong correlation reframes consistency into a direct target for model improvement. We therefore introduce Round-Trip Reinforcement Learning (RTRL), a novel framework that trains a model to improve its consistency by using the success of a round-trip transformation as a reward signal. We further propose an iterative variant where forward and reverse mappings alternately train each other in a self-improvement loop, a process that is highly data-efficient and notably effective with the massive amount of unlabelled data common in chemistry. Experiments demonstrate that RTRL significantly \textbf{boosts performance and consistency} over strong baselines across supervised, self-supervised, and synthetic data regimes. This work shows that round-trip consistency is not just a desirable property but a trainable objective, offering a new path toward more robust and reliable foundation models.

Large Language Model (LLM)-driven approaches avoid training a large supernet and can provide quick feedback, but we observe an exploration bias: the LLM repeatedly proposes neural network designs within limited search space and fails to discover architectures across different latency ranges in the entire search space. To address this issue, we propose PEL-NAS: a search space Partitioned, architecture prompt co-Evolutionary and LLM-driven Neural Architecture Search that can generate neural networks with high accuracy and low latency with reduced search cost. Our proposed PEL-NAS has three key components: 1) a complexity-driven partitioning engine that divides the search space by complexity to enforce diversity and mitigate exploration bias; 2) an LLM-powered architecture prompt co-evolution operator, in which the LLM first updates a knowledge base of design heuristics based on results from the previous round, then performs a guided evolution algorithm on architectures with prompts that incorporate this knowledge base. Prompts and designs improve together across rounds which avoids random guesswork and improve efficiency; 3) a zero-cost predictor to avoid training a large number of candidates from scratch. Experimental results show that on HW-NAS-Bench, PEL-NAS can achieve overall higher HV, lower IGD, and up to 54% lower latency than baselines at similar accuracy. Meanwhile, the search cost drops from days to minutes compared with traditional supernet baselines.

      A plethora of applications entail solving black-box optimization problems with high evaluation costs, including drug discovery, material design, as well as hyperparameter tuning. Toward finding the global optimum of such black-box optimization problems with sample efficiency, Bayesian optimization (BO) is a theoretically elegant framework that relies on a probabilistic surrogate model so as to iteratively select the query point with well-balanced exploration-exploitation tradeoffs. The Gaussian process (GP), as the de-facto choice for surrogate modeling, has achieved compelling performances for vanilla BO with low-dimensional continuous variables. However, GPs fall short in coping with high-dimensional counterparts with {\it irregular} variables (e.g., categorical, ordinal, etc.). To alleviate this, neural network-based surrogates have been explored. Inspired by the powerful capabilities of LLMs, we adopt the LLM as the surrogate to model the mapping from the high-dimensional input variables to the objective function. To adapt to the current problem, we leverage the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the LLM parameters together with the posterior of a linear regression head via the variational Bayesian last layer (VBLL) framework. The resulting LoRA-VBLL is not only computationally light compared to existing alternatives, but also admits recursive updates. To automate the critical selection of the LoRA rank as well as other hyperparameters, a weighted ensemble (ENS) of LoRA-VBLL surrogates has been devised, which further accommodates continual update of the per-model weight and individual LoRA-VBLL parameters via recursive Bayes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the compelling performance of the proposed (ENS-)LoRA-VBLL approaches on various high-dimensional benchmarks and the real-world molecular optimization tasks.

      Since the release of Deepseek-R1, reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a central approach for training large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks. Recent work has largely focused on modifying loss functions to make RLVR more efficient and effective. In this paper, motivated by studies of overthinking in LLMs, we propose Length-aware Sampling for Policy Optimization (LSPO), a novel meta-RLVR algorithm that dynamically selects training data at each step based on the average response length. We evaluate LSPO across multiple base models and datasets, demonstrating that it consistently improves learning effectiveness. In addition, we conduct a detailed ablation study to examine alternative ways of incorporating length signals into dynamic sampling, offering further insights and highlighting promising directions for future research.

      LLMs are increasingly used world-wide from daily tasks to agentic systems and data analytics, requiring significant GPU resources. LLM inference systems, however, are slow compared to database systems, and inference performance and mechanism have been often regarded as a black box, limiting the expansion of the use of LLMs inside databases and other performance-critical applications. This paper first analyzes the LLM inference performance and focuses on a data management issue inside LLM inference. We find that inference systems lack an adequate resource cost model and optimization strategy to schedule requests with their intermediate results in a cache reside in GPU memory when executing multiple concurrent inference requests. We adapt classic database techniques by building cost models for concurrent inference requests and a new cache replacement policy tailored for LLM inference, which can substantially save GPU costs.

      Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and biomedical foundation models (BioFMs) have achieved strong results in biological text reasoning, molecular modeling, and single-cell analysis, yet they remain siloed in disjoint embedding spaces, limiting cross-modal reasoning. We present BIOVERSE (Biomedical Vector Embedding Realignment for Semantic Engagement), a two-stage approach that adapts pretrained BioFMs as modality encoders and aligns them with LLMs through lightweight, modality-specific projection layers. The approach first aligns each modality to a shared LLM space through independently trained projections, allowing them to interoperate naturally, and then applies standard instruction tuning with multi-modal data to bring them together for downstream reasoning. By unifying raw biomedical data with knowledge embedded in LLMs, the approach enables zero-shot annotation, cross-modal question answering, and interactive, explainable dialogue. Across tasks spanning cell-type annotation, molecular description, and protein function reasoning, compact BIOVERSE configurations surpass larger LLM baselines while enabling richer, generative outputs than existing BioFMs, establishing a foundation for principled multi-modal biomedical reasoning.

      At the core of Deep Research is knowledge mining, the task of extracting structured information from massive unstructured text in response to user instructions. Large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting such instructions but are prohibitively expensive to deploy at scale, while traditional pipelines of classifiers and extractors remain efficient yet brittle and unable to generalize to new tasks. We introduce Falconer, a collaborative framework that combines the agentic reasoning of LLMs with lightweight proxy models for scalable knowledge mining. In Falconer, LLMs act as planners, decomposing user instructions into executable pipelines, and as annotators, generating supervision to train small proxies. The framework unifies classification and extraction into two atomic operations, get label and get span, enabling a single instruction-following model to replace multiple task-specific components. To evaluate the consistency between proxy models incubated by Falconer and annotations provided by humans and large models, we construct new benchmarks covering both planning and end-to-end execution. Experiments show that Falconer closely matches state-of-the-art LLMs in instruction-following accuracy while reducing inference cost by up to 90% and accelerating large-scale knowledge mining by more than 20x, offering an efficient and scalable foundation for Deep Research.

      While Large Language Models (LLMs) have become the predominant paradigm for automated code generation, current single-model approaches fundamentally ignore the heterogeneous computational strengths that different models exhibit across programming languages, algorithmic domains, and development stages. This paper challenges the single-model convention by introducing a multi-stage, performance-guided orchestration framework that dynamically routes coding tasks to the most suitable LLMs within a structured generate-fix-refine workflow. Our approach is grounded in a comprehensive empirical study of 17 state-of-the-art LLMs across five programming languages (Python, Java, C++, Go, and Rust) using HumanEval-X benchmark. The study, which evaluates both functional correctness and runtime performance metrics (execution time, mean/max memory utilization, and CPU efficiency), reveals pronounced performance heterogeneity by language, development stage, and problem category. Guided by these empirical insights, we present PerfOrch, an LLM agent that orchestrates top-performing LLMs for each task context through stage-wise validation and rollback mechanisms. Without requiring model fine-tuning, PerfOrch achieves substantial improvements over strong single-model baselines: average correctness rates of 96.22% and 91.37% on HumanEval-X and EffiBench-X respectively, surpassing GPT-4o's 78.66% and 49.11%. Beyond correctness gains, the framework delivers consistent performance optimizations, improving execution time for 58.76% of problems with median speedups ranging from 17.67% to 27.66% across languages on two benchmarks. The framework's plug-and-play architecture ensures practical scalability, allowing new LLMs to be profiled and integrated seamlessly, thereby offering a paradigm for production-grade automated software engineering that adapts to the rapidly evolving generative AI landscape.

      Large language model (LLM) agents deployed for multi-step tasks frequently fail in predictable ways: attempting actions with unmet preconditions, issuing redundant commands, or mishandling environment constraints. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can improve performance by providing runtime guidance, it requires maintaining external knowledge databases and adds computational overhead at every deployment. We propose a simple pipeline that converts inference-time retrieval into learned competence through distillation. Our approach: (1) extracts compact, reusable hints from agent failures, (2) uses these hints to generate improved teacher trajectories via one-shot retrieval at episode start, and (3) trains student models on these trajectories with hint strings removed, forcing internalization rather than memorization. Across two interactive benchmarks, ALFWorld (household tasks) and WebShop (online shopping), distilled students consistently outperform baseline agents, achieving up to 91% success on ALFWorld (vs. 79% for baselines) and improving WebShop scores to 72 (vs. 61 for baselines), while using 10-60% fewer tokens than retrieval-augmented teachers depending on the environment. The approach generalizes across model scales (7B/14B parameters) and agent architectures (ReAct/StateAct), demonstrating that retrieval benefits can be effectively internalized through targeted fine-tuning without permanent runtime dependencies.

      The increasing complexity of clinical decision-making, alongside the rapid expansion of electronic health records (EHR), presents both opportunities and challenges for delivering data-informed care. This paper proposes a clinical decision support system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist prescribing clinicians. The system generates therapeutic suggestions by analyzing historical EHR data, including patient demographics, presenting complaints, clinical symptoms, diagnostic information, and treatment histories. The framework integrates natural language processing with structured clinical inputs to produce contextually relevant recommendations. Rather than replacing clinician judgment, it is designed to augment decision-making by retrieving and synthesizing precedent cases with comparable characteristics, drawing on local datasets or federated sources where applicable. At its core, the system employs a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline that harmonizes unstructured narratives and codified data to support LLM-based inference. We outline the system's technical components, including representation representation alignment and generation strategies. Preliminary evaluations, conducted with de-identified and synthetic clinical datasets, examine the clinical plausibility and consistency of the model's outputs. Early findings suggest that LLM-based tools may provide valuable decision support in prescribing workflows when appropriately constrained and rigorously validated. This work represents an initial step toward integration of generative AI into real-world clinical decision-making with an emphasis on transparency, safety, and alignment with established practices.

We propose a framework that incorporates Meta-Cognitive and Arbitration Modules, enabling LLMs to evaluate and regulate their own outputs autonomously. Our approach is evaluated on seven state-of-the-art LLMs using two datasets: AdvBench and Prompt-Injection-Mixed-Techniques-2024. Experiment results demonstrate significant improvements in defense success rates across models and datasets, with some achieving perfect and near-perfect defense in Enhanced Mode. We also analyze the trade-off between defense success rate improvement and computational overhead. This self-consciousness method offers a lightweight, cost-effective solution for enhancing LLM ethics, particularly beneficial for GenAI use cases across various platforms.

      Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by using a smaller draft model to speculate tokens that a larger target model verifies. Verification is often the bottleneck (e.g. verification is $4\times$ slower than token generation when a 3B model speculates for a 70B target model), but most prior works focus only on accelerating drafting. $\textit{``Intermediate"}$ verification reduces verification time by discarding inaccurate draft tokens early, but existing methods incur substantial training overheads in incorporating the intermediate verifier, increase the memory footprint to orchestrate the intermediate verification step, and compromise accuracy by relying on approximate heuristics. We propose $\underline{\textit{Hi}}\textit{erarchical }\underline{\textit{Spec}}\textit{ulative Decoding (HiSpec)}$, a framework for high-throughput speculative decoding that exploits $\textit{early-exit (EE) models}$ for low-overhead intermediate verification. EE models allow tokens to exit early by skipping layer traversal and are explicitly trained so that hidden states at selected layers can be interpreted, making them uniquely suited for intermediate verification without drastically increasing compute and memory overheads. To improve resource-efficiency even further, we design a methodology that enables HiSpec to re-use key-value caches and hidden states between the draft, intermediate verifier, and target models. To maintain accuracy, HiSpec periodically validates the draft tokens accepted by the intermediate verifier against the target model. Our evaluations using various representative benchmarks and models show that HiSpec improves throughput by 1.28$\times$ on average and by up to 2.01$\times$ compared to the baseline single-layer speculation without compromising accuracy.

We empirically observe that the activations of pre-trained LLMs exhibit low-rank property. Motivated by such observations, we propose CoLA and its memory-efficient implementation, CoLA-M, to replace these full-size layers with compute-efficient auto-encoders that naturally enforce low-rank activations throughout training. This fundamental architectural change eliminates the activation redundancy and significantly boosts model capacity and training efficiency. Experiments on LLaMA models with 60 million to 7 billion parameters show that CoLA reduces the computing cost by $\bf 2\pmb{\times}$ and improves training throughput by $\bf 1.86\pmb{\times}$ while maintaining full-rank level performance. CoLA-M further squeezes memory cost without sacrificing throughput, offering a pre-training approach with collectively superior parameter, computing, and memory efficiency. The LLMs produced are also $\bf 2\pmb{\times}$ smaller, enabling faster inference with lower memory cost on resource-constrained platforms.

      Post-training alignment often reduces LLM diversity, leading to a phenomenon known as mode collapse. Unlike prior work that attributes this effect to algorithmic limitations, we identify a fundamental, pervasive data-level driver: typicality bias in preference data, whereby annotators systematically favor familiar text as a result of well-established findings in cognitive psychology. We formalize this bias theoretically, verify it on preference datasets empirically, and show that it plays a central role in mode collapse. Motivated by this analysis, we introduce Verbalized Sampling, a simple, training-free prompting strategy to circumvent mode collapse. VS prompts the model to verbalize a probability distribution over a set of responses (e.g., ``Generate 5 jokes about coffee and their corresponding probabilities''). Comprehensive experiments show that VS significantly improves performance across creative writing (poems, stories, jokes), dialogue simulation, open-ended QA, and synthetic data generation, without sacrificing factual accuracy and safety. For instance, in creative writing, VS increases diversity by 1.6-2.1x over direct prompting. We further observe an emergent trend that more capable models benefit more from VS. In sum, our work provides a new data-centric perspective on mode collapse and a practical inference-time remedy that helps unlock pre-trained generative diversity.

To address this, we introduce the Social Welfare Function (SWF) Benchmark, a dynamic simulation environment where an LLM acts as a sovereign allocator, distributing tasks to a heterogeneous community of recipients. The benchmark is designed to create a persistent trade-off between maximizing collective efficiency (measured by Return on Investment) and ensuring distributive fairness (measured by the Gini coefficient). We evaluate 20 state-of-the-art LLMs and present the first leaderboard for social welfare allocation. Our findings reveal three key insights: (i) A model's general conversational ability, as measured by popular leaderboards, is a poor predictor of its allocation skill. (ii) Most LLMs exhibit a strong default utilitarian orientation, prioritizing group productivity at the expense of severe inequality. (iii) Allocation strategies are highly vulnerable, easily perturbed by output-length constraints and social-influence framing. These results highlight the risks of deploying current LLMs as societal decision-makers and underscore the need for specialized benchmarks and targeted alignment for AI governance.

Since post-training LLMs via RL remains sensitive to batching and prompt selection strategies, we first conduct a series of systematic experiments where we (1) determine the optimal training batch size that balances generation efficiency and gradient quality and (2) establish the importance of focusing on prompts of intermediate difficulty for the policy. We build upon these results to design PCL, which identifies prompts of intermediate difficulty for the current policy in an on-policy manner by using a value model that is concurrently updated based on the current policy. By focusing on informative prompts that yield high effective ratios, PCL achieves either the highest performance or requires significantly less time to reach comparable performance to its counterparts. Compared to rollout-based filtering methods, PCL avoids costly rollouts and achieves $12.1\times$ and $16.9\times$ faster speed on identifying intermediate-difficulty prompts when training on MATH and DeepScaleR, respectively. We further demonstrate that our value model accurately predicts prompt difficulty and allows PCL to focus on progressively more challenging prompts during RL. Our results present a new methodology that delivers improved tradeoff between upper-bound performance and efficiency for reasoning-focused RL.

      Reasoning training incentivizes LLMs to produce long chains of thought (long CoT), which among other things, allows them to explore solution strategies with self-checking. This results in higher accuracy, but inflates context length, token/compute cost, and answer latency. We ask: Can current models leverage their metacognition to provide other combinations on this Pareto frontier, e.g., better accuracy with lower context length and/or latency? Abstractly, we view the model as an improvement operator on its own "thoughts" with a continuum of possible strategies. We identify an interesting inference family Parallel-Distill-Refine (PDR), which performs the following: (i) generate diverse drafts in parallel; (ii) distill them into a bounded, textual workspace; and (iii) refine conditioned on this workspace, producing an output that seeds the next round. Importantly, context length (hence compute cost) is controllable via degree of parallelism, and is no longer conflated with the total number of generated tokens. We report PDR instantiations of current models that give better accuracy than long CoT while incurring lower latency. Setting degree of parallelism to 1 yields an interesting subcase, Sequential Refinement (SR) (iteratively improve a single candidate answer) which provides performance superior to long CoT. Success of such model orchestrations raises the question whether further training could shift the Pareto frontier. To this end, we train an 8B thinking model with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to make it consistent with PDR as the inference method. On math tasks with verifiable answers, iterative pipelines surpass single-pass baselines at matched sequential budgets, with PDR delivering the largest gains (e.g., +11% on AIME 2024 and +9% on AIME 2025).

      Time series data is fundamental to decision-making in many crucial domains including healthcare, finance, and environmental science. However, analyzing this data often requires incorporating unstructured contextual information, answering domain-specific questions, and generating natural language explanations -- capabilities that traditional time series models lack due to their inability to process text. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at contextual reasoning and knowledge integration, they struggle with numerical time series due to inefficient text-based representations and limited exposure to temporal data during pretraining. We address this gap by augmenting an LLM with specialized time series perception through a patch-based encoder-decoder architecture. We train this Time Series-augmented LLM (TsLLM) on a large corpus of over 2 million interleaved time series and text examples spanning diverse analysis tasks: forecasting with contextual information, time series question-answering, pattern explanation, classification with natural language outputs, and report generation. This training enables TsLLM to leverage both its language understanding and newly acquired temporal reasoning capabilities. While not designed to surpass specialized models on traditional benchmarks, TsLLM demonstrates strong performance on tasks requiring the integration of time series analysis with natural language -- capabilities that existing approaches cannot provide. Our work establishes a new paradigm for time series analysis that bridges numerical computation and natural language understanding, democratizing access to sophisticated temporal reasoning through natural language interaction.

      Ensuring Large Language Model (LLM) safety remains challenging due to the absence of universal standards and reliable content validators, making it difficult to obtain effective training signals. We discover that aligned models already possess robust internal safety beliefs: they consistently produce high-confidence refusals to harmful requests while exhibiting high entropy when generating potentially dangerous content. This entropy gap reveals an untapped signal--models intrinsically "know" when to refuse. We introduce Safety Instincts Reinforcement Learning (SIRL), which transforms this internal confidence into a self-generated reward signal, eliminating dependence on external validators or human annotations. SIRL teaches models to trust their safety instincts by reinforcing low-entropy refusal behaviors. Evaluated on Llama and Qwen models, SIRL maintains 89%+ Defense Success Rates (DSRs) against 20+ jailbreak methods, from static prompts to adaptive attacks. Using only 15,000 unlabeled prompts, SIRL surpasses resource-intensive supervised methods while preserving performance on mathematics, coding, and conversation benchmarks.

Along with this, we also provide a set of baselines across 24 environments using REINFORCE with Return Batch Normalization (ReBN), which -- unlike GRPO -- is compatible with the full RL setting of dense per-turn rewards and offers better credit assignment. We further conduct apple-to-apple benchmarking of PPO, GRPO and REINFORCE in both single- and multi-turn settings using GEM to shed light on the algorithmic designs. Lastly, GEM also functions as a convenient evaluation toolkit besides a training environment. We hope this framework can help accelerate future agentic LLM research.

      Curriculum learning plays a crucial role in enhancing the training efficiency of large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks. However, existing methods often fail to adequately account for variations in prompt difficulty or rely on simplistic filtering mechanisms to select prompt datasets within a narrow criterion range, resulting in significant computational waste. In this work, we approach the problem from the perspective of reinforcement learning gradient optimization, offering a systematic and theoretical investigation into how to improve the training efficiency of LLMs. We identify two key factors influencing training efficiency: the selection of training prompts and the allocation of rollout quantities across different prompts. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the sampling distribution of prompts dictates the convergence rate of gradient descent, while the allocation of the rollout quantity influences the consistency and stability of overall gradient updates. Based on these insights, we propose CurES, an efficient training method that accelerates convergence and employs Bayesian posterior estimation to minimize computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that our CurES outperforms Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) by \textbf{+3.30} points and \textbf{+4.82} points with 1.5B and 7B models, respectively. Additionally, CurES exhibits faster convergence compared to baselines, including GRPO.

      Motivated by the puzzling observation that inserting long sequences of meaningless tokens before the query prompt can consistently enhance LLM reasoning performance, this work analyzes the underlying mechanism driving this phenomenon and based on these insights proposes a more principled method that allows for similar performance gains. First, we find that the improvements arise from a redistribution of activations in the LLM's MLP layers, where near zero activations become less frequent while large magnitude activations increase. This redistribution enhances the model's representational capacity by suppressing weak signals and promoting stronger, more informative ones. Building on this insight, we propose the Activation Redistribution Module (ARM), a lightweight inference-time technique that modifies activations directly without altering the input sequence. ARM adaptively identifies near-zero activations after the non-linear function and shifts them outward, implicitly reproducing the beneficial effects of meaningless tokens in a controlled manner. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and model architectures clearly show that ARM consistently improves LLM performance on reasoning tasks while requiring only a few lines of simple code to implement. Our findings deliver both a clear mechanistic explanation for the unexpected benefits of meaningless tokens and a simple yet effective technique that harnesses activation redistribution to further improve LLM performance.
