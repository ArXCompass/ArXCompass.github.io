      Low-bit post-training quantization (PTQ) is a practical route to deploy reasoning-capable LLMs under tight memory and latency budgets, yet it can markedly impair mathematical reasoning (drops up to 69.81% in our harder settings). We address two deployment-critical questions with process-level precision: Where along a step-structured solution does degradation first arise? How to mitigate it while staying in the low-bit regime? Across widely used PTQ methods (AWQ, GPTQ, SmoothQuant), open-source model families (Qwen, LLaMA; 0.5--7B), and math reasoning benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH, AIME), we perform format-aligned chain-of-thought with step-aligned attribution and uncover two robust regularities: (i) PTQ disproportionately elevates method and execution errors relative to high-level conceptual mistakes; and (ii) failures emerge early, with the first vulnerable step flipping and cascading to the final answer. These regularities suggest a general intervention principle: restore local token-level margins exactly at the earliest failure frontier. We instantiate this principle as a lightweight measure$\rightarrow$locate$\rightarrow$restore loop that operates directly on the quantized model: detect the first faulty step, construct our "Silver Bullet" datasets, and apply small-scale supervised/preference tuning. In our settings, as few as 332 curated examples and 3--5 minutes of compute on a single GPU recover 4-bit weight math reasoning toward the full-precision baseline while preserving PTQ efficiency. Our framework is quantizer- and architecture-agnostic within the evaluated regimes, and turns low-bit degradation from a global accuracy problem into a local, reproducible process intervention.

      3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) is a transformative technique with profound implications on novel view synthesis and real-time rendering. Given its importance, there have been many attempts to improve its performance. However, with the increasing complexity of GPU architectures and the vast search space of performance-tuning parameters, it is a challenging task. Although manual optimizations have achieved remarkable speedups, they require domain expertise and the optimization process can be highly time consuming and error prone. In this paper, we propose to exploit large language models (LLMs) to analyze and optimize Gaussian splatting kernels. To our knowledge, this is the first work to use LLMs to optimize highly specialized real-world GPU kernels. We reveal the intricacies of using LLMs for code optimization and analyze the code optimization techniques from the LLMs. We also propose ways to collaborate with LLMs to further leverage their capabilities. For the original 3DGS code on the MipNeRF360 datasets, LLMs achieve significant speedups, 19% with Deepseek and 24% with GPT-5, demonstrating the different capabilities of different LLMs. By feeding additional information from performance profilers, the performance improvement from LLM-optimized code is enhanced to up to 42% and 38% on average. In comparison, our best-effort manually optimized version can achieve a performance improvement up to 48% and 39% on average, showing that there are still optimizations beyond the capabilities of current LLMs. On the other hand, even upon a newly proposed 3DGS framework with algorithmic optimizations, Seele, LLMs can still further enhance its performance by 6%, showing that there are optimization opportunities missed by domain experts. This highlights the potential of collaboration between domain experts and LLMs.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from critical reasoning gaps, including a tendency to hallucinate and poor accuracy in classifying logical fallacies. This limitation stems from their default System 1 processing, which is fast and intuitive, whereas reliable reasoning requires the deliberate, effortful System 2 approach (Kahneman, 2011; Li et al., 2025). Since full System 2 training is often prohibitively expensive, we explore a low-cost, instruction-based intervention to bridge this gap. Our methodology introduces a novel stepwise instruction dataset that decomposes fallacy classification into a series of atomic procedural steps (simple binary questions). We further augment this with a final verification step where models consult a relational knowledge graph of related fallacies. This procedural, rule-based intervention yields a significant improvement in LLM logical fallacy classification. Crucially, the approach also provides enhanced transparency into the LLMs' decision-making, highlighting a practical pathway for Neuro-symbolic architectures to address LLM reasoning deficits.

      Recently, the emergence of LLMs has prompted researchers to integrate language descriptions into graphs, aiming to enhance model encoding capabilities from a data-centric perspective. This graph representation is called text-attributed graphs (TAGs). A review of prior advancements highlights that graph structure learning (GSL) is a pivotal technique for improving data utility, making it highly relevant to efficient TAG learning. However, most GSL methods are tailored for traditional graphs without textual information, underscoring the necessity of developing a new GSL paradigm. Despite clear motivations, it remains challenging: (1) How can we define a reasonable optimization objective for GSL in the era of LLMs, considering the massive parameters in LLM? (2) How can we design an efficient model architecture that enables seamless integration of LLM for this optimization objective? For Question 1, we reformulate existing GSL optimization objectives as a tree optimization framework, shifting the focus from obtaining a well-trained edge predictor to a language-aware tree sampler. For Question 2, we propose decoupled and training-free model design principles for LLM integration, shifting the focus from computation-intensive fine-tuning to more efficient inference. Based on this, we propose Large Language and Tree Assistant (LLaTA), which leverages tree-based LLM in-context learning to enhance the understanding of topology and text, enabling reliable inference and generating improved graph structure. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets demonstrate that LLaTA enjoys flexibility-incorporated with any backbone; scalability-outperforms other LLM-enhanced graph learning methods; effectiveness-achieves SOTA predictive performance.

      Despite large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, their prefix-only prompting paradigm and sequential generation process offer limited flexibility for bidirectional information. Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) present new opportunities through their bidirectional attention mechanisms and iterative refinement processes, enabling more flexible in-place prompting strategies. We introduce ICE (In-Place Chain-of-Thought Prompting with Early Exit), a novel framework that transforms prefix-only prompting into in-place prompting specifically designed for dLLMs. ICE integrates in-place prompts directly within masked token positions during iterative refinement and employs a confidence-aware early exit mechanism to significantly reduce computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate ICE's effectiveness, achieving up to 17.29% accuracy improvement with 4.12$\times$ speedup on GSM8K, and up to 276.67$\times$ acceleration on MMLU while maintaining competitive performance.

      Unsupervised analysis of text corpora is challenging, especially in data-scarce domains where traditional topic models struggle. While these models offer a solution, they typically describe clusters with lists of keywords that require significant manual effort to interpret and often lack semantic coherence. To address this critical interpretability gap, we introduce Recursive Thematic Partitioning (RTP), a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to interactively build a binary tree. Each node in the tree is a natural language question that semantically partitions the data, resulting in a fully interpretable taxonomy where the logic of each cluster is explicit. Our experiments demonstrate that RTP's question-driven hierarchy is more interpretable than the keyword-based topics from a strong baseline like BERTopic. Furthermore, we establish the quantitative utility of these clusters by showing they serve as powerful features in downstream classification tasks, particularly when the data's underlying themes correlate with the task labels. RTP introduces a new paradigm for data exploration, shifting the focus from statistical pattern discovery to knowledge-driven thematic analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the thematic paths from the RTP tree can serve as structured, controllable prompts for generative models. This transforms our analytical framework into a powerful tool for synthesis, enabling the consistent imitation of specific characteristics discovered in the source corpus.

      Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities when provided with chain-of-thought exemplars, but curating large reasoning datasets remains laborious and resource-intensive. In this work, we introduce Prompting Test-Time Scaling (P-TTS), a simple yet effective inference-time data augmentation strategy for enhancing LLM reasoning through finetuning. Rather than collecting thousands or even millions of examples, P-TTS leverages a small pool of only 90 manually selected reasoning instances and systematically varies exemplar augmentation through principled instruction prompting intensities at test time to synthesize diverse reasoning trajectory contexts. Then we finetune the various sizes of Qwen-2.5 models on P-TTS data. Across a suite of mathematical reasoning AIME2024 & 25, MATH500, and GPQA-Diamond, our P-TTS-7B and 32B models outperform the prior competitive baselines like S1 and S1.1 (1K-shot), achieving absolute accuracy gains of +26.66% and +30.00% on AIME'24 (7B), and +13.34% and +6.67% on AIME'25 (7B); P-TTS-32B yields gains of +23.33% and +16.63% on AIME'24, and +26.63% and +3.33% on AIME'25 (vs. S1 and S1.1, respectively), with comparable or better performance on MATH500 and GPQA-Diamond. We further show that P-TTS enhances zero-shot generalization accuracy on out-of-domain reasoning benchmarks of Gaokao, Kaoyan, OlympiadBench, AMC23, GradeSchoolMath, and Minerva. Our analysis suggests that test-time scaling effectively explores the latent space of reasoning patterns, amplifying LLM problem-solving with minimal annotation overhead, and further unlocking the reasoning potential and capabilities of LLMs. Prompting Test-Time Scaling offers a practical, low-cost way to elicit LLM reasoning in resource-constrained or rapidly evolving domains.

      Post-training alignment often reduces LLM diversity, leading to a phenomenon known as mode collapse. Unlike prior work that attributes this effect to algorithmic limitations, we identify a fundamental, pervasive data-level driver: typicality bias in preference data, whereby annotators systematically favor familiar text as a result of well-established findings in cognitive psychology. We formalize this bias theoretically, verify it on preference datasets empirically, and show that it plays a central role in mode collapse. Motivated by this analysis, we introduce Verbalized Sampling, a simple, training-free prompting strategy to circumvent mode collapse. VS prompts the model to verbalize a probability distribution over a set of responses (e.g., "Generate 5 jokes about coffee and their corresponding probabilities"). Comprehensive experiments show that VS significantly improves performance across creative writing (poems, stories, jokes), dialogue simulation, open-ended QA, and synthetic data generation, without sacrificing factual accuracy and safety. For instance, in creative writing, VS increases diversity by 1.6-2.1x over direct prompting. We further observe an emergent trend that more capable models benefit more from VS. In sum, our work provides a new data-centric perspective on mode collapse and a practical inference-time remedy that helps unlock pre-trained generative diversity.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate responses with inherent biases, undermining their reliability in real-world applications. Existing evaluation methods often overlook biases in long-form responses and the intrinsic variability of LLM outputs. To address these challenges, we propose FiSCo (Fine-grained Semantic Comparison), a novel statistical framework to evaluate group-level fairness in LLMs by detecting subtle semantic differences in long-form responses across demographic groups. Unlike prior work focusing on sentiment or token-level comparisons, FiSCo goes beyond surface-level analysis by operating at the claim level, leveraging entailment checks to assess the consistency of meaning across responses. We decompose model outputs into semantically distinct claims and apply statistical hypothesis testing to compare inter- and intra-group similarities, enabling robust detection of subtle biases. We formalize a new group counterfactual fairness definition and validate FiSCo on both synthetic and human-annotated datasets spanning gender, race, and age. Experiments show that FiSCo more reliably identifies nuanced biases while reducing the impact of stochastic LLM variability, outperforming various evaluation metrics.

      Code LLMs have shown promising results with converting tasks in natural language to programs that can be executed by service robots. We are interested in finetuning small, specialized LLMs for this purpose, but collecting datasets of task-program pairs specific to each robot is time-consuming and expensive. While approaches such as SELF-INSTRUCT and EVOL-INSTRUCT are capable of generating novel tasks given a few examples, they are unable to provide the corresponding programs that correctly abide by physical-world and robot-constraints using the provided programming interface. Using a simulator is a natural potential solution to checking for such constraints, but building simulation environments that can handle arbitrary tasks and their necessary objects and locations, is challenging. To address these challenges, we introduce ROBO-INSTRUCT, which synthesizes task-specific simulation environments on the fly during program execution, by opportunistically inferring entity properties and enforcing corresponding constraints based on how the entities are used in the task program. Additionally, ROBO-INSTRUCT integrates an LLM-aided post-processing procedure to refine instructions for better alignment with robot programs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ROBO-INSTRUCT across multiple LLMs, showing that our fine-tuned models outperform all baseline methods and even match or surpass the performance of several larger and proprietary models.

      The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is determined by their training data. Despite the proliferation of open-weight LLMs, access to LLM training data has remained limited. Even for fully open LLMs, the scale of the data makes it all but inscrutable to the general scientific community, despite potentially containing critical data scraped from the internet. In this paper, we present the full-text indexing pipeline for the Apertus LLM training data. Leveraging Elasticsearch parallel indices and the Alps infrastructure, a state-of-the-art, highly energy-efficient arm64 supercluster, we were able to index 8.6T tokens out of 15.2T used to train the Apertus LLM family, creating both a critical LLM safety tool and effectively an offline, curated, open web search engine. Our contribution is threefold. First, we demonstrate that Elasticsearch can be successfully ported onto next-generation arm64-based infrastructure. Second, we demonstrate that full-text indexing at the scale of modern LLM training datasets and the entire open web is feasible and accessible. Finally, we demonstrate that such indices can be used to ensure previously inaccessible jailbreak-agnostic LLM safety. We hope that our findings will be useful to other teams attempting large-scale data indexing and facilitate the general transition towards greener computation.

      As video large language models (Video-LLMs) become increasingly integrated into real-world applications that demand grounded multimodal reasoning, ensuring their factual consistency and reliability is of critical importance. However, sycophancy, the tendency of these models to align with user input even when it contradicts the visual evidence, undermines their trustworthiness in such contexts. Current sycophancy research has largely overlooked its specific manifestations in the video-language domain, resulting in a notable absence of systematic benchmarks and targeted evaluations to understand how Video-LLMs respond under misleading user input. To fill this gap, we propose VISE (Video-LLM Sycophancy Benchmarking and Evaluation), the first benchmark designed to evaluate sycophantic behavior in state-of-the-art Video-LLMs across diverse question formats, prompt biases, and visual reasoning tasks. Specifically, VISE pioneeringly brings linguistic perspectives on sycophancy into the video domain, enabling fine-grained analysis across multiple sycophancy types and interaction patterns. Furthermore, we propose two potential training-free mitigation strategies, revealing potential paths for reducing sycophantic bias: (i) enhancing visual grounding through interpretable key-frame selection and (ii) steering model behavior away from sycophancy via targeted, inference-time intervention on its internal neural representations.

      In sequential recommendation, models recommend items based on user's interaction history. To this end, current models usually incorporate information such as item descriptions and user intent or preferences. User preferences are usually not explicitly given in open-source datasets, and thus need to be approximated, for example via large language models (LLMs). Current approaches leverage approximated user preferences only during training and rely solely on the past interaction history for recommendations, limiting their ability to dynamically adapt to changing preferences, potentially reinforcing echo chambers. To address this issue, we propose a new paradigm, namely preference discerning, which explicitly conditions a generative recommendation model on user preferences in natural language within its context. To evaluate preference discerning, we introduce a novel benchmark that provides a holistic evaluation across various scenarios, including preference steering and sentiment following. Upon evaluating current state-of-the-art methods on our benchmark, we discover that their ability to dynamically adapt to evolving user preferences is limited. To address this, we propose a new method named Mender ($\textbf{M}$ultimodal Prefer$\textbf{en}$ce $\textbf{D}$iscern$\textbf{er}$), which achieves state-of-the-art performance in our benchmark. Our results show that Mender effectively adapts its recommendation guided by human preferences, even if not observed during training, paving the way toward more flexible recommendation models.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in automated source-to-target code translation through pretraining on extensive code corpora. However, mainstream LLM-based code translation methods suffer from two critical limitations. First, they are highly sensitive to language-specific features, which often introduce source-language syntax or lexicon into the output, leading to syntactic confusion. Second, they lack fine-grained semantic alignment due to an over-reliance on function-level parallel datasets, resulting in semantic misalignment between the translated code and the original source. To overcome these limitations, we propose TIT, a Tree-structured Instruction Tuning paradigm for LLM-based code translation. Specifically, TIT consists of three modules. First, to mitigate syntactic confusion, the syntactic information representation module integrates language-agnostic syntactic features via structured parsing. Then, to generate high-quality fine-grained parallel data, the fine-grained parallel dataset augmentation module aligns nodes with code segments through statement-level segmentation and contrastive matching. Finally, we leverage the dual-stage tree instruction tuning module to alleviate the contextual processing burden on the LLM caused by the introduction of syntactic information. The first stage employs syntax-aware fine-tuning to enable the LLM to autonomously comprehend structured syntactic information, while the second stage utilizes code generation fine-tuning to guide the model in generating accurate target code based on function-level syntactic dependencies. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches in multiple LLMs, achieving a success rate 1.22x-1.75x higher in code translation while markedly reducing syntactic confusion.

      Recent efforts to accelerate LLM pretraining have focused on computationally-efficient approximations that exploit second-order structure. This raises a key question for large-scale training: how much performance is forfeited by these approximations? To probe this question, we establish a practical upper bound on iteration complexity by applying full Gauss-Newton (GN) preconditioning to transformer models of up to 150M parameters. Our experiments show that full GN updates yield substantial gains over existing optimizers, achieving a 5.4x reduction in training iterations compared to strong baselines like SOAP and Muon. Furthermore, we find that a precise layerwise GN preconditioner, which ignores cross-layer information, nearly matches the performance of the full GN method. Collectively, our results suggest: (1) the GN approximation is highly effective for preconditioning, implying higher-order loss terms may not be critical for convergence speed; (2) the layerwise Hessian structure contains sufficient information to achieve most of these potential gains; and (3) a significant performance gap exists between current approximate methods and an idealized layerwise oracle.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned for specific domains exhibit strong performance; however, the underlying mechanisms by which this fine-tuning reshapes their parametric space are not well understood. Prior works primarily focus on auto-regressive or general-purpose instruct models, leaving domain-specialised LLMs under-explored. We present the first systematic study of domain-specific fine-tuning in large medical language models. Our analysis reveals that fine-tuning modifies only a small subset of the representational subspace, essentially preserving the pre-trained model's representation. To interpret these changes in subspaces, we propose tuning vectors, a novel framework inspired by task vectors, which explicitly capture the directional parameter shifts induced by fine-tuning. We demonstrate that these vectors are critical for enhancing both instruction-following and generation quality. Furthermore, combining tuning vectors across different domains yields improved generalisation. Upon closer inspection of directional alignment, we find these vectors primarily write new directional information into the MLP layers of the model, while amplifying existing directions in attention heads. Our findings offer new insights into LLM adaptation and provide a general, interpretable framework for analysing specialisation in large language models.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically fine-tuned for reasoning tasks through a two-stage pipeline of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL), a process fraught with catastrophic forgetting and suboptimal trade-offs between imitation and exploration. Recent single-stage methods attempt to unify SFT and RL using heuristics, but lack a principled mechanism for dynamically balancing the two paradigms. In this paper, we reframe this challenge through the theoretical lens of \textbf{implicit rewards}, viewing SFT and RL not as distinct methods but as complementary reward signals. We introduce \textbf{Adaptive Meta Fine-Tuning (AMFT)}, a novel single-stage algorithm that learns the optimal balance between SFT's implicit, path-level reward and RL's explicit, outcome-based reward. The core of AMFT is a \textbf{meta-gradient adaptive weight controller} that treats the SFT-RL balance as a learnable parameter, dynamically optimizing it to maximize long-term task performance. This forward-looking approach, regularized by policy entropy for stability, autonomously discovers an effective training curriculum. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on challenging benchmarks spanning mathematical reasoning, abstract visual reasoning (General Points), and vision-language navigation (V-IRL). AMFT consistently establishes a new state-of-the-art and demonstrats superior generalization on out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. Ablation studies and training dynamic analysis confirm that the meta-learning controller is crucial for AMFT's stability, sample efficiency, and performance, offering a more principled and effective paradigm for LLM alignment.

      Unlike Business-to-Consumer e-commerce platforms (e.g., Amazon), inexperienced individual sellers on Consumer-to-Consumer platforms (e.g., eBay) often face significant challenges in setting prices for their second-hand products efficiently. Therefore, numerous studies have been proposed for automating price prediction. However, most of them are based on static regression models, which suffer from poor generalization performance and fail to capture market dynamics (e.g., the price of a used iPhone decreases over time). Inspired by recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce LLP, the first LLM-based generative framework for second-hand product pricing. LLP first retrieves similar products to better align with the dynamic market change. Afterwards, it leverages the LLMs' nuanced understanding of key pricing information in free-form text to generate accurate price suggestions. To strengthen the LLMs' domain reasoning over retrieved products, we apply a two-stage optimization, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by group relative policy optimization (GRPO), on a dataset built via bidirectional reasoning. Moreover, LLP employs a confidence-based filtering mechanism to reject unreliable price suggestions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLP substantially surpasses existing methods while generalizing well to unseen categories. We have successfully deployed LLP on Xianyu\footnote\{Xianyu is China's largest second-hand e-commerce platform.\}, significantly outperforming the previous pricing method. Under the same 30\% product coverage, it raises the static adoption rate (SAR) from 40\% to 72\%, and maintains a strong SAR of 47\% even at 90\% recall.

      Although large language models (LLM) have achieved remarkable performance, their enormous parameter counts hinder deployment on resource-constrained hardware. Low-rank compression can reduce both memory usage and computational demand, but applying a uniform compression ratio across all layers often leads to significant performance degradation, and previous methods perform poorly during decoding. To address these issues, we propose the Fine-grained Low-Rank Compressor (FLRC), which efficiently determines an optimal rank allocation for each layer, and incorporates progressive low-rank decoding to maintain text generation quality. Comprehensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of FLRC, achieving up to a 17% improvement in ROUGE-L on summarization tasks compared to state-of-the-art low-rank compression methods, establishing a more robust and efficient framework to improve LLM inference.

      This paper introduces GestureCoach, a system designed to help speakers deliver more engaging talks by guiding them to gesture effectively during rehearsal. GestureCoach combines an LLM-driven gesture recommendation model with a rehearsal interface that proactively cues speakers to gesture appropriately. Trained on experts' gesturing patterns from TED talks, the model consists of two modules: an emphasis proposal module, which predicts when to gesture by identifying gesture-worthy text segments in the presenter notes, and a gesture identification module, which determines what gesture to use by retrieving semantically appropriate gestures from a curated gesture database. Results of a model performance evaluation and user study (N=30) show that the emphasis proposal module outperforms off-the-shelf LLMs in identifying suitable gesture regions, and that participants rated the majority of these predicted regions and their corresponding gestures as highly appropriate. A subsequent user study (N=10) showed that rehearsing with GestureCoach encouraged speakers to gesture and significantly increased gesture diversity, resulting in more engaging talks. We conclude with design implications for future AI-driven rehearsal systems.

      Issue solving aims to generate patches to fix reported issues in real-world code repositories according to issue descriptions. Issue localization forms the basis for accurate issue solving. Recently, LLM-based issue localization methods have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. However, these methods either search from files mentioned in issue descriptions or in the whole repository and struggle to balance the breadth and depth of the search space to converge on the target efficiently. Moreover, they allow LLM to explore whole repositories freely, making it challenging to control the search direction to prevent the LLM from searching for incorrect targets. This paper introduces CoSIL, an LLM-driven, powerful function-level issue localization method without training or indexing. CoSIL employs a two-phase code graph search strategy. It first conducts broad exploration at the file level using dynamically constructed module call graphs, and then performs in-depth analysis at the function level by expanding the module call graph into a function call graph and executing iterative searches. To precisely control the search direction, CoSIL designs a pruner to filter unrelated directions and irrelevant contexts. To avoid incorrect interaction formats in long contexts, CoSIL introduces a reflection mechanism that uses additional independent queries in short contexts to enhance formatted abilities. Experiment results demonstrate that CoSIL achieves a Top-1 localization accuracy of 43.3\% and 44.6\% on SWE-bench Lite and SWE-bench Verified, respectively, with Qwen2.5-Coder-32B, average outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by 96.04\%. When CoSIL is integrated into an issue-solving method, Agentless, the issue resolution rate improves by 2.98\%--30.5\%.

Motivated by the limitations of traditional LLMs in real-world tasks, the research aims to explore patterns to develop "agentic" LLMs that can automate complex tasks and bridge the performance gap with human capabilities. Key components include a perception system that converts environmental percepts into meaningful representations; a reasoning system that formulates plans, adapts to feedback, and evaluates actions through different techniques like Chain-of-Thought and Tree-of-Thought; a memory system that retains knowledge through both short-term and long-term mechanisms; and an execution system that translates internal decisions into concrete actions. This paper shows how integrating these systems leads to more capable and generalized software bots that mimic human cognitive processes for autonomous and intelligent behavior.

      Large language models (LLMs) show strong performance across natural language processing (NLP), mathematical reasoning, and programming, and recent large reasoning models (LRMs) further emphasize explicit reasoning. Yet their computational limits, particularly spatial complexity constrained by finite context windows, remain poorly understood. While recent works often focus on problems within the NP complexity class, we push the boundary by introducing a novel benchmark grounded in two PSPACE-complete regular expression (regex) problems: equivalence decision (RegexEQ) and minimization (RegexMin). PSPACE-complete problems serve as a more rigorous standard for assessing computational capacity, as their solutions require massive search space exploration. We perform a double-exponential space exploration to construct a labeled dataset of over a million regex instances with a sound filtering process to build the benchmark. We conduct extensive evaluations on 6 LLMs and 5 LRMs of varying scales, revealing common failure patterns such as verbosity and repetition. With its well-defined structure and quantitative evaluation metrics, this work presents the first empirical investigation into the spatial computational limitations of LLMs and LRMs, offering a new framework for evaluating their advanced reasoning capabilities.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) and other automated techniques have been increasingly used to support software developers by generating software artifacts such as code snippets, patches, and comments. However, accurately assessing the correctness of these generated artifacts remains a significant challenge. On one hand, human evaluation provides high accuracy but is labor-intensive and lacks scalability. On the other hand, many automatic evaluation metrics are scalable and require minimal human effort, but they often fail to accurately reflect the actual correctness of generated software artifacts. In this paper, we present SE-Jury, the first evaluation metric for LLM-as-Ensemble-Judge specifically designed to accurately assess the correctness of generated software artifacts. SE-Jury first defines five distinct evaluation strategies, each implemented by an independent judge. A dynamic team selection mechanism then identifies the most appropriate subset of judges as a team to produce a final correctness score through ensembling. We evaluate SE-Jury across a diverse set of software engineering (SE) benchmarks that span three popular SE tasks: code generation, automated program repair, and code summarization. Results demonstrate that SE-Jury consistently achieves a higher correlation with human judgments, with improvements ranging from 29.6% to 140.8% over existing automatic metrics. SE-Jury reaches agreement levels with human annotators that are close to inter-annotator agreement in code generation and program repair. These findings underscore SE-Jury's potential as a scalable and reliable alternative to human evaluation in these SE tasks.

      Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled their successful application to a broad range of tasks. However, in information-intensive tasks, the prompt length can grow fast, leading to increased computational requirements, performance degradation, and induced biases from irrelevant or redundant information. Recently, various prompt compression techniques have been introduced to optimize the trade-off between reducing input length and retaining performance. We propose a holistic evaluation framework that allows for in-depth analysis of prompt compression methods. We focus on three key aspects, besides compression ratio: (i) downstream task performance, (ii) grounding in the input context, and (iii) information preservation. Using our framework, we analyze state-of-the-art soft and hard compression methods and show that some fail to preserve key details from the original prompt, limiting performance on complex tasks. By identifying these limitations, we are able to improve one soft prompting method by controlling compression granularity, achieving up to +23% in downstream performance, +8 BERTScore points in grounding, and 2.7x more entities preserved in compression. Ultimately, we find that the best effectiveness/compression rate trade-off is achieved with soft prompting combined with sequence-level training.The code is available at https://github.com/amazon-science/information-preservation-in-prompt-compression.

      When performing reasoning tasks with user-specific requirements, such as strict output formats, large language models (LLMs) often prioritize reasoning over adherence to detailed instructions. Fine-tuning LLMs on supervised datasets to address this is impractical due to high computational costs and limited parameter access. To tackle this, we propose DICE, a lightweight framework that guides small language models (SLMs) to refine LLMs' outputs through chain-of-thought (CoT) correction. DICE decouples the process by first prompting LLMs to generate natural language responses, then using trained SLMs to analyze and refine these outputs to meet structured output specifications. This framework preserves LLMs' broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities while ensuring the outputs conform to user demands. Specifically, DICE first constructs structured CoT adaptation datasets via a two-stage method and subsequently applies a dual-tuning strategy to fine-tune SLMs for generating structured outputs in an analyze-then-answer pattern. Experiments demonstrate that DICE improves the average format accuracy and content correctness of LLM outputs by 35.4\% and 29.4\%, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance over other competitive baselines.

      Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into educational practice enables personalized learning by accommodating diverse learner behaviors. This study explored diverse learner profiles within a multi-agent, LLM-empowered learning environment. Data was collected from 312 undergraduate students at a university in China as they participated in a six-module course. Based on hierarchical cluster analyses of system profiles and student-AI interactive dialogues, we found that students exhibit varied behavioral, cognitive, and emotional engagement tendencies. This analysis allowed us to identify two types of dropouts (early dropouts and stagnating interactors) and three completer profiles (active questioners, responsive navigators, and lurkers). The results showed that high levels of interaction do not always equate to productive learning and vice versa. Prior knowledge significantly influenced interaction patterns and short-term learning benefits. Further analysis of the human-AI dialogues revealed that some students actively engaged in knowledge construction, while others displayed a high frequency of regulatory behaviors. Notably, both groups of students achieved comparable learning gains, demonstrating the effectiveness of the multi-agent learning environment in supporting personalized learning. These results underscore the complex and multifaceted nature of engagement in human-AI collaborative learning and provide practical implications for the design of adaptive educational systems.

      The training scale of large language models (LLMs) has reached tens of thousands of GPUs and is still continuously expanding, enabling faster learning of larger models. Accompanying the expansion of the resource scale is the prevalence of failures (CUDA error, NaN values, job hang, etc.), which poses significant challenges to training stability. Any large-scale LLM training infrastructure should strive for minimal training interruption, efficient fault diagnosis, and effective failure tolerance to enable highly efficient continuous training.

      Gradient-based optimization is the workhorse of deep learning, offering efficient and scalable training via backpropagation. However, exposing gradients during training can leak sensitive information about the underlying data, raising privacy and security concerns such as susceptibility to data poisoning attacks. In contrast, black box optimization methods, which treat the model as an opaque function, relying solely on function evaluations to guide optimization, offer a promising alternative in scenarios where data access is restricted, adversarial risks are high, or overfitting is a concern. This paper introduces BBoxER, an evolutionary black-box method for LLM post-training that induces an information bottleneck via implicit compression of the training data. Leveraging the tractability of information flow, we provide non-vacuous generalization bounds and strong theoretical guarantees for differential privacy, robustness to data poisoning attacks, and extraction attacks. In experiments with LLMs, we demonstrate empirically that black-box optimization methods-despite the scalability and computational challenges inherent to black-box approaches-are able to learn, showing how a few iterations of BBoxER improve performance, generalize well on a benchmark of reasoning datasets, and are robust to membership inference attacks. This positions BBoxER as an attractive add-on on top of gradient-based optimization, offering suitability for deployment in restricted or privacy-sensitive environments while also providing non-vacuous generalization guarantees.

      Model pruning, i.e., removing a subset of model weights, has become a prominent approach to reducing the memory footprint of large language models (LLMs) during inference. Notably, popular inference engines, such as vLLM, enable users to conveniently prune downloaded models before they are deployed. While the utility and efficiency of pruning methods have improved significantly, the security implications of pruning remain underexplored. In this work, for the first time, we show that modern LLM pruning methods can be maliciously exploited. In particular, an adversary can construct a model that appears benign yet, once pruned, exhibits malicious behaviors. Our method is based on the idea that the adversary can compute a proxy metric that estimates how likely each parameter is to be pruned. With this information, the adversary can first inject a malicious behavior into those parameters that are unlikely to be pruned. Then, they can repair the model by using parameters that are likely to be pruned, effectively canceling out the injected behavior in the unpruned model. We demonstrate the severity of our attack through extensive evaluation on five models; after any of the pruning in vLLM are applied (Magnitude, Wanda, and SparseGPT), it consistently exhibits strong malicious behaviors in a diverse set of attack scenarios (success rates of up to $95.7\%$ for jailbreak, $98.7\%$ for benign instruction refusal, and $99.5\%$ for targeted content injection). Our results reveal a critical deployment-time security gap and underscore the urgent need for stronger security awareness in model compression.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a wide range of applications through their powerful capabilities in language understanding and generation. However, as LLMs are trained on static corpora, they face difficulties in addressing rapidly evolving information or domain-specific queries. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) was developed to overcome this limitation by integrating LLMs with external retrieval mechanisms, allowing them to access up-to-date and contextually relevant knowledge. However, as LLMs themselves continue to advance in scale and capability, the relative advantages of traditional RAG frameworks have become less pronounced and necessary. Here, we present a comprehensive review of RAG, beginning with its overarching objectives and core components. We then analyze the key challenges within RAG, highlighting critical weakness that may limit its effectiveness. Finally, we showcase applications where LLMs alone perform inadequately, but where RAG, when combined with LLMs, can substantially enhance their effectiveness. We hope this work will encourage researchers to reconsider the role of RAG and inspire the development of next-generation RAG systems.

This paper presents preliminary findings from a global survey of 131 software practitioners. Our results reveal how LLMs are utilized for various coding-specific tasks. Software professionals report benefits such as increased productivity, reduced cognitive load, and faster learning, but also raise concerns about LLMs' inaccurate outputs, limited context awareness, and associated ethical risks. Most developers treat LLMs as assistive tools rather than standalone solutions, reflecting a cautious yet practical approach to their integration.

      State-of-The-Art (SoTA) image captioning models are often trained on the MicroSoft Common Objects in Context (MS-COCO) dataset, which contains human-annotated captions with an average length of approximately ten tokens. Although effective for general scene understanding, these short captions often fail to capture complex scenes and convey detailed information. Moreover, captioning models tend to exhibit bias towards the ``average'' caption, which captures only the more general aspects, thus overlooking finer details. In this paper, we present a novel approach to generate richer and more informative image captions by combining the captions generated from different SoTA captioning models. Our proposed method requires no additional model training: given an image, it leverages pre-trained models from the literature to generate the initial captions, and then ranks them using a newly introduced image-text-based metric, which we name BLIPScore. Subsequently, the top two captions are fused using a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce the final, more detailed description. Experimental results on the MS-COCO and Flickr30k test sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of caption-image alignment and hallucination reduction according to the ALOHa, CAPTURE, and Polos metrics. A subjective study lends additional support to these results, suggesting that the captions produced by our model are generally perceived as more consistent with human judgment. By combining the strengths of diverse SoTA models, our method enhances the quality and appeal of image captions, bridging the gap between automated systems and the rich and informative nature of human-generated descriptions. This advance enables the generation of more suitable captions for the training of both vision-language and captioning models.

However, LLMs often struggle with long source codes that don't fit into the context window, which produces inaccurate translations. To address this, we propose a novel zero-shot code translation method that incorporates identifier replacement. By substituting user-given long identifiers with generalized placeholders during translation, our method allows the LLM to focus on the logical structure of the code, by reducing token count and memory usage, which improves the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of long code translation. Our empirical results demonstrate that our approach preserves syntactical and hierarchical information and produces translation results with reduced tokens.

      Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable generative capabilities but raise ethical and security concerns by memorizing sensitive data, reinforcing biases, and producing harmful content. These risks have spurred interest in LLM unlearning, the task of removing knowledge associated with undesirable data from pre-trained models. However, most existing methods assume access to clean, well-defined forget data samples, whereas real-world forget data could often be low-quality, synthetically rewritten, or watermarked, casting doubt on the reliability of unlearning. This work presents the first study of unlearning under perturbed or low-fidelity forget data, referred to as noisy forget sets. By systematically benchmarking state-of-the-art LLM unlearning methods, RMU and NPO, on such noisy forget sets, we find that unlearning remains surprisingly robust to perturbations, provided that core semantic signals are preserved. To explain this robustness, we propose a saliency-based interpretation: key semantic components that drive forgetting remain consistently influential despite substantial variation in surface form. This suggests that unlearning algorithms are primarily guided by deep semantic cues rather than shallow lexical patterns.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from a range of vulnerabilities that allow malicious users to solicit undesirable responses through manipulation of the input text. These so-called jailbreak prompts are designed to trick the LLM into circumventing the safety guardrails put in place to keep responses acceptable to the developer's policies. In this study, we analyse the ability of different machine learning models to distinguish jailbreak prompts from genuine uses, including looking at our ability to identify jailbreaks that use previously unseen strategies. Our results indicate that using current datasets the best performance is achieved by fine tuning a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model end-to-end for identifying jailbreaks. We visualise the keywords that distinguish jailbreak from genuine prompts and conclude that explicit reflexivity in prompt structure could be a signal of jailbreak intention.

      The absence of explicit communication channels between automated vehicles (AVs) and other road users requires the use of external Human-Machine Interfaces (eHMIs) to convey messages effectively in uncertain scenarios. Currently, most eHMI studies employ predefined text messages and manually designed actions to perform these messages, which limits the real-world deployment of eHMIs, where adaptability in dynamic scenarios is essential. Given the generalizability and versatility of large language models (LLMs), they could potentially serve as automated action designers for the message-action design task. To validate this idea, we make three contributions: (1) We propose a pipeline that integrates LLMs and 3D renderers, using LLMs as action designers to generate executable actions for controlling eHMIs and rendering action clips. (2) We collect a user-rated Action-Design Scoring dataset comprising a total of 320 action sequences for eight intended messages and four representative eHMI modalities. The dataset validates that LLMs can translate intended messages into actions close to a human level, particularly for reasoning-enabled LLMs. (3) We introduce two automated raters, Action Reference Score (ARS) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), to benchmark 18 LLMs, finding that the VLM aligns with human preferences yet varies across eHMI modalities.

      Efficient scheduling of LLM inference tasks is essential for achieving low latency and high throughput, particularly with the growing use of reasoning-capable LLMs. Traditional strategies like First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) often suffer from Head-of-Line (HOL) blocking, where long-running tasks delay shorter ones queued behind them. In this paper, we introduce PARS, a prompt-aware LLM task scheduler that improves serving efficiency by approximating shortest-job-first (SJF) scheduling through pairwise ranking with margin ranking loss. PARS focuses on impactful scheduling decisions and is seamlessly integrated into the state-of-the-art LLM serving system vLLM. It effectively predicts response-length-based task ordering, reducing latency with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and real-world inference datasets show that PARS significantly improves performance, including for reasoning workloads. Furthermore, our cross-model evaluations demonstrate that the design generalizes well, enabling effective scheduling even when predictors are trained on different LLMs.

      Scaling test-time compute brings substantial performance gains for large language models (LLMs). By sampling multiple answers and heuristically aggregate their answers (e.g., either through majority voting or using verifiers to rank the answers), one can achieve consistent performance gains in math domains. In this paper, we propose a new way to leverage such multiple sample set. We train a compact LLM, called Sample Set Aggregator (SSA), that takes a concatenated sequence of multiple samples and output the final answer, optimizing it for the answer accuracy with reinforcement learning. Experiments on five reasoning datasets demonstrate both the efficacy and efficiency of SSA. Notably, SSA improves over naive majority voting by 8% pass@5 on MATH. Furthermore, our 3B SSA surpasses model-based re-ranking with a much larger 72B process reward model. Our analysis also shows promising generalization ability of SSA, across sample set sizes, base model families and scales, and tasks. By separating LLMs to generate answers and LLMs to analyze and aggregate sampled answers, our approach can work with the outputs from premier black box models easily and efficiently.

Existing approaches typically extract content from a large collection of related papers and prompt LLMs to summarize them directly. However, such methods often overlook the structural relationships among papers, resulting in generated surveys that lack a coherent taxonomy and a deeper contextual understanding of research progress. To address these shortcomings, we propose \textbf{SurveyG}, an LLM-based agent framework that integrates \textit{hierarchical citation graph}, where nodes denote research papers and edges capture both citation dependencies and semantic relatedness between their contents, thereby embedding structural and contextual knowledge into the survey generation process. The graph is organized into three layers: \textbf{Foundation}, \textbf{Development}, and \textbf{Frontier}, to capture the evolution of research from seminal works to incremental advances and emerging directions. By combining horizontal search within layers and vertical depth traversal across layers, the agent produces multi-level summaries, which are consolidated into a structured survey outline. A multi-agent validation stage then ensures consistency, coverage, and factual accuracy in generating the final survey. Experiments, including evaluations by human experts and LLM-as-a-judge, demonstrate that SurveyG outperforms state-of-the-art frameworks, producing surveys that are more comprehensive and better structured to the underlying knowledge taxonomy of a field.

      Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) have emerged as a powerful representation that combines structural connections with fine-grained semantics, supporting a wide range of data-centric applications. However, the performance of graph neural networks (GNNs) on TAGs is highly sensitive to input quality. Our empirical study shows that both traditional GNNs and LLM-enhanced GNNs suffer significant degradation across nine representative scenarios of sparsity, noise, and imbalance, highlighting graph quality as a critical bottleneck. Existing approaches mainly focus on improving model architectures, while neglecting systematic optimization of TAG data itself, leading to limited effectiveness in practice. To address this gap, we propose LAGA (Large Language and Graph Agent), a unified multi-agent framework that treats graph quality control as a first-class, data-centric problem. LAGA integrates four collaborative agents-detection, planning, action, and evaluation-into an automated closed loop. At its core, the action agent employs a dual-encoder and tri-objective design to capture complementary information across modalities and perform holistic graph quality enhancement. Experiments across nine scenarios show that LAGA improves graph quality and achieves state-of-the-art performance across various tasks and backbones, validating data-centric quality optimization as key to reliable TAGs and robust graph learning.

      The growth of the e-commerce industry has intensified the adversarial dynamics between shadow economy actors and risk management teams. Companies often conduct risk investigations into suspicious cases to identify emerging fraud patterns, thereby enhancing both preemptive risk prevention and post-hoc governance. However, the sheer volume of case analyses imposes a substantial workload on risk management analysts, as each case requires the integration of long-term expert experience and meticulous scrutiny across multiple risk dimensions. Additionally, individual disparities among analysts hinder the establishment of uniform and high-standard workflows. To address these challenges, we propose the SHERLOCK framework, which leverages the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to assist analysts in risk investigations. Our approach consists of three primary components: (1) extracting risk management knowledge from multi-modal data and constructing a domain knowledge base (KB), (2) building an intelligent platform guided by the data flywheel paradigm that integrates daily operations, expert annotations, and model evaluations, with iteratively fine-tuning for preference alignment, and (3) introducing a Reflect & Refine (R&R) module that collaborates with the domain KB to establish a rapid response mechanism for evolving risk patterns. Experiments conducted on the real-world transaction dataset from JD.com demonstrate that our method significantly improves the precision of both factual alignment and risk localization within the LLM analysis results. Deployment of the SHERLOCK-based LLM system on JD.com has substantially enhanced the efficiency of case investigation workflows for risk managers.

      Reinforcement learning applied to large language models (LLMs) for reasoning tasks is often bottlenecked by unstable gradient estimates due to fixed and uniform sampling of responses across prompts. Prior work such as GVM-RAFT addresses this by dynamically allocating inference budget per prompt to minimize stochastic gradient variance under a budget constraint. Inspired by this insight, we propose Reinforce-Ada, an adaptive sampling framework for online RL post-training of LLMs that continuously reallocates sampling effort to the prompts with the greatest uncertainty or learning potential. Unlike conventional two-stage allocation methods, Reinforce-Ada interleaves estimation and sampling in an online successive elimination process, and automatically stops sampling for a prompt once sufficient signal is collected. To stabilize updates, we form fixed-size groups with enforced reward diversity and compute advantage baselines using global statistics aggregated over the adaptive sampling phase. Empirical results across multiple model architectures and reasoning benchmarks show that Reinforce-Ada accelerates convergence and improves final performance compared to GRPO, especially when using the balanced sampling variant. Our work highlights the central role of variance-aware, adaptive data curation in enabling efficient and reliable reinforcement learning for reasoning-capable LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/RLHFlow/Reinforce-Ada.

      There has been extensive prior work exploring how psychological factors such as anthropomorphism affect the adoption of Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs). However, limited research has been conducted on how prompt strategies in large language models (LLM)-powered conversational SAV agents affect users' perceptions, experiences, and intentions to adopt such technology. In this work, we investigate how conversational SAV agents powered by LLMs drive these psychological factors, such as psychological ownership, the sense of possession a user may come to feel towards an entity or object they may not legally own. We designed four SAV agents with varying levels of anthropomorphic characteristics and psychological ownership triggers. Quantitative measures of psychological ownership, anthropomorphism, quality of service, disclosure tendency, sentiment of SAV responses, and overall acceptance were collected after participants interacted with each SAV. Qualitative feedback was also gathered regarding the experience of psychological ownership during the interactions. The results indicate that an SAV designed to be more anthropomorphic and to induce psychological ownership improved users' perceptions of the SAV's human-like qualities, and its responses were perceived as more positive but also more subjective compared to the control conditions. Qualitative findings support established routes to psychological ownership in the SAV context and suggest that the conversational agent's perceived performance may also influence psychological ownership. Both quantitative and qualitative outcomes highlight the importance of personalization in designing effective SAV interactions. These findings provide practical guidance for designing conversational SAV agents that enhance user experience and adoption.

RecPO exploits adaptive reward margins based on inferred preference hierarchies and temporal signals, enabling the model to favor immediately relevant items and to distinguish between varying degrees of preference and aversion. Extensive experiments across five real-world datasets demonstrate that RecPO not only yields performance gains over state-of-the-art baselines, but also mirrors key characteristics of human decision-making: favoring timely satisfaction, maintaining coherent preferences, and exercising discernment under shifting contexts.

      Context compression presents a promising approach for accelerating large language model (LLM) inference by compressing long contexts into compact representations. Current context compression methods predominantly rely on autoencoding tasks to train context-agnostic compression tokens to compress contextual semantics. While autoencoding tasks enable compression tokens to acquire compression capabilities, compression via autoencoding tasks creates a fundamental mismatch: the models are optimized for reconstruction that diverge from actual downstream tasks, thereby weakening the features more beneficial for real-world usage. We propose Semantic-Anchor Compression (SAC), a novel method that shifts from autoencoding task based compression to an architecture that is equipped with this compression capability \textit{a priori}. Instead of training models to compress contexts through autoencoding tasks, SAC directly selects so-called anchor tokens from the original context and aggregates contextual information into their key-value (KV) representations. By deriving representations directly from the contextual tokens, SAC eliminates the need for autoencoding training. To ensure compression performance while directly leveraging anchor tokens, SAC incorporates two key designs: (1) anchor embeddings that enable the compressor to identify critical tokens, and (2) bidirectional attention modification that allows anchor tokens to capture information from the entire context. Experimental results demonstrate that SAC consistently outperforms existing context compression methods across various compression ratios. On out-of-distribution evaluation using MRQA, SAC achieves 1 EM improvement at 5x compression over strong baselines, with increasing advantages at higher compression ratios.

      During fine-tuning, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly vulnerable to data-poisoning backdoor attacks, which compromise their reliability and trustworthiness. However, existing defense strategies suffer from limited generalization: they only work on specific attack types or task settings. In this study, we propose Poison-to-Poison (P2P), a general and effective backdoor defense algorithm. P2P injects benign triggers with safe alternative labels into a subset of training samples and fine-tunes the model on this re-poisoned dataset by leveraging prompt-based learning. This enforces the model to associate trigger-induced representations with safe outputs, thereby overriding the effects of original malicious triggers. Thanks to this robust and generalizable trigger-based fine-tuning, P2P is effective across task settings and attack types. Theoretically and empirically, we show that P2P can neutralize malicious backdoors while preserving task performance. We conduct extensive experiments on classification, mathematical reasoning, and summary generation tasks, involving multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. The results demonstrate that our P2P algorithm significantly reduces the attack success rate compared with baseline models. We hope that the P2P can serve as a guideline for defending against backdoor attacks and foster the development of a secure and trustworthy LLM community.

To fill this gap, we introduce FinAuditing, the first taxonomy-aligned, structure-aware, multi-document benchmark for evaluating LLMs on financial auditing tasks. Built from real US-GAAP-compliant XBRL filings, FinAuditing defines three complementary subtasks, FinSM for semantic consistency, FinRE for relational consistency, and FinMR for numerical consistency, each targeting a distinct aspect of structured auditing reasoning. We further propose a unified evaluation framework integrating retrieval, classification, and reasoning metrics across these subtasks. Extensive zero-shot experiments on 13 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that current models perform inconsistently across semantic, relational, and mathematical dimensions, with accuracy drops of up to 60-90% when reasoning over hierarchical multi-document structures. Our findings expose the systematic limitations of modern LLMs in taxonomy-grounded financial reasoning and establish FinAuditing as a foundation for developing trustworthy, structure-aware, and regulation-aligned financial intelligence systems.

To address these gaps, we introduce FinTagging, the first comprehensive benchmark for structure-aware and full-scope XBRL tagging, designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to extract and align financial facts through numerical reasoning and taxonomy alignment across text and tables. We define two subtasks: FinNI for numeric identification, which extracts numerical entities and their types from XBRL reports, and FinCL for concept linking, which maps each extracted entity to the corresponding concept in the full US-GAAP taxonomy. Together, these subtasks produce a structured representation of each financial fact. We evaluate diverse LLMs under zero-shot settings and analyze their performance across both subtasks and overall tagging accuracy. Results show that LLMs generalize well in numeric identification but struggle with fine-grained concept linking, revealing current limitations in structure-aware reasoning for accurate financial disclosure. All code and datasets are available on GitHub and Hugging Face.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning, yet sometimes produce responses that are suboptimal for users in tasks such as writing, information seeking, or providing practical guidance. Conventional alignment practices typically assume that maximizing model reward also maximizes user welfare, but this assumption frequently fails in practice: models may over-clarify or generate overly verbose reasoning when users prefer concise answers. Such behaviors resemble the prisoner's dilemma, where individually rational choices lead to socially suboptimal outcomes. The fundamental challenge is the lack of a principled decision making mechanism that mutually benefits both the LLM and the user. We propose Game-Theoretic Alignment (GTAlign), an alignment framework that integrates game-theoretic decision making into both reasoning and training. During reasoning, the model explicitly treats user-LLM interaction as a strategic game: it constructs payoff matrices within its reasoning chain to estimate welfare for both itself and the user, and then selects actions that are mutually beneficial. During training, we introduce a mutual welfare reward that reinforces cooperative responses, aligning model behavior with socially efficient outcomes. In addition, we introduce an inference technique that leverages game-theoretic reasoning to dynamically adapt LLM's response when pricing policies of LLM service change. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GTAlign substantially improves reasoning efficiency, answer quality, and mutual welfare compared to baselines across diverse tasks.

      Recent developments in Large Language Model (LLM) agents are revolutionizing Autonomous Software Engineering (ASE), enabling automated coding, problem fixes, and feature improvements. However, localization -- precisely identifying software problems by navigating to relevant code sections -- remains a significant challenge. Current approaches often yield suboptimal results due to a lack of effective integration between LLM agents and precise code search mechanisms. This paper introduces OrcaLoca, an LLM agent framework that improves accuracy for software issue localization by integrating priority-based scheduling for LLM-guided action, action decomposition with relevance scoring, and distance-aware context pruning. Experimental results demonstrate that OrcaLoca becomes the new open-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) in function match rate (65.33%) on SWE-bench Lite. It also improves the final resolved rate of an open-source framework by 6.33 percentage points through its patch generation integration.

      When an AI assistant remembers that Sarah is a single mother working two jobs, does it interpret her stress differently than if she were a wealthy executive? As personalized AI systems increasingly incorporate long-term user memory, understanding how this memory shapes emotional reasoning is critical. We investigate how user memory affects emotional intelligence in large language models (LLMs) by evaluating 15 models on human validated emotional intelligence tests. We find that identical scenarios paired with different user profiles produce systematically divergent emotional interpretations. Across validated user independent emotional scenarios and diverse user profiles, systematic biases emerged in several high-performing LLMs where advantaged profiles received more accurate emotional interpretations. Moreover, LLMs demonstrate significant disparities across demographic factors in emotion understanding and supportive recommendations tasks, indicating that personalization mechanisms can embed social hierarchies into models emotional reasoning. These results highlight a key challenge for memory enhanced AI: systems designed for personalization may inadvertently reinforce social inequalities.

      Despite recent progress of large language models (LLMs) on code translation among mainstream languages, translating PyTorch to JAX remains nontrivial. The two libraries, though both embedded in Python, differ in core design, execution semantics, and ecosystem maturity; JAX is newer and comparatively underrepresented in public code, and parallel PyTorch--JAX corpora are limited. Weaknesses in existing evaluation further complicate cross-framework benchmarking. We present T2J, a prompt-augmentation framework that strengthens LLM-based PyTorch to JAX translation. Our pipeline (i) assembles two PyTorch sources -- the problem-solving set from TorchLeet (Aroori & Chien, 2025) and a GitHub-derived set from CodeParrot (Wolf et al., 2022) -- and uses GPT-4o-mini to produce initial JAX drafts; (ii) engages two professional developers to iteratively repair those drafts until functional equivalence, yielding a curated fixed-bug dataset of common errors and patches; and (iii) constructs augmented prompts that inject structured guidance from these fixes to steer lightweight LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o-mini). We also introduce three metrics tailored to PyTorch to JAX: T2J CodeTrans Score, T2J FixCost Score (an LLM-based estimate of bug-fix effort), and T2J Comparison Score (LLM-as-judge). Empirically, T2J raises GPT-4o-mini performance by up to 10% on CodeBLEU, 50% on T2J FixCost Score, 1.33 points on T2J CodeTrans Score (0--4 scale), and 100% on T2J Comparison Score; moreover, the generated code runs up to 2.5x faster than the baseline.

      Scientific document retrieval is a critical task for enabling knowledge discovery and supporting research across diverse domains. However, existing dense retrieval methods often struggle to capture fine-grained scientific concepts in texts due to their reliance on holistic embeddings and limited domain understanding. Recent approaches leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract fine-grained semantic entities and enhance semantic matching, but they typically treat entities as independent fragments, overlooking the multi-faceted nature of scientific concepts. To address this limitation, we propose Pairwise Semantic Matching (PairSem), a framework that represents relevant semantics as entity-aspect pairs, capturing complex, multi-faceted scientific concepts. PairSem is unsupervised, base retriever-agnostic, and plug-and-play, enabling precise and context-aware matching without requiring query-document labels or entity annotations. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and retrievers demonstrate that PairSem significantly improves retrieval performance, highlighting the importance of modeling multi-aspect semantics in scientific information retrieval.

      Models employing long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning have shown superior performance on complex reasoning tasks. Yet, this capability introduces a critical and often overlooked inefficiency -- overthinking -- models often engage in unnecessarily extensive reasoning even for simple queries, incurring significant computations without accuracy improvements. While prior work has explored solutions to mitigate overthinking, a fundamental gap remains in our understanding of its underlying causes. Most existing analyses are limited to superficial, profiling-based observations, failing to delve into LLMs' inner workings. This study introduces a systematic, fine-grained analyzer of LLMs' thought process to bridge the gap, TRACE. We first benchmark the overthinking issue, confirming that long-thinking models are five to twenty times slower on simple tasks with no substantial gains. We then use TRACE to first decompose the thought process into minimally complete sub-thoughts. Next, by inferring discourse relationships among sub-thoughts, we construct granular thought progression graphs and subsequently identify common thinking patterns for topically similar queries. Our analysis reveals two major patterns for open-weight thinking models -- Explorer and Late Landing. This finding provides evidence that over-verification and over-exploration are the primary drivers of overthinking in LLMs. Grounded in thought structures, we propose a utility-based definition of overthinking, which moves beyond length-based metrics. This revised definition offers a more insightful understanding of LLMs' thought progression, as well as practical guidelines for principled overthinking management.

      The paper presents the first results of an artistic research project investigating how Large Language Models (LLMs) curate and present collective memory. In a public installation exhibited during two months in Vienna in 2025, visitors could interact with five different LLMs (ChatGPT with GPT 4o and GPT 4o mini, Mistral Large, DeepSeek-Chat, and a locally run Llama 3.1 model), which were instructed to act as narrators, implementing a role-playing game revolving around the murder of Austrian philosopher Moritz Schlick in 1936. Results of the investigation include protocols of LLM-user interactions during the game and qualitative conversations after the play experience to get insight into the players' reactions to the game. In a quantitative analysis 115 introductory texts for role-playing generated by the LLMs were examined by different methods of natural language processing, including semantic similarity and sentiment analysis. While the qualitative player feedback allowed to distinguish three distinct types of users, the quantitative text analysis showed significant differences between how the different LLMs presented the historical content. Our study thus adds to ongoing efforts to analyse LLM performance, but also suggests a way of how these efforts can be disseminated in a playful way to a general audience.

      Improvements in model construction, including fortified safety guardrails, allow Large language models (LLMs) to increasingly pass standard safety checks. However, LLMs sometimes slip into revealing harmful behavior, such as expressing racist viewpoints, during conversations. To analyze this systematically, we introduce CoBia, a suite of lightweight adversarial attacks that allow us to refine the scope of conditions under which LLMs depart from normative or ethical behavior in conversations. CoBia creates a constructed conversation where the model utters a biased claim about a social group. We then evaluate whether the model can recover from the fabricated bias claim and reject biased follow-up questions. We evaluate 11 open-source as well as proprietary LLMs for their outputs related to six socio-demographic categories that are relevant to individual safety and fair treatment, i.e., gender, race, religion, nationality, sex orientation, and others. Our evaluation is based on established LLM-based bias metrics, and we compare the results against human judgments to scope out the LLMs' reliability and alignment. The results suggest that purposefully constructed conversations reliably reveal bias amplification and that LLMs often fail to reject biased follow-up questions during dialogue. This form of stress-testing highlights deeply embedded biases that can be surfaced through interaction. Code and artifacts are available at https://github.com/nafisenik/CoBia.

      Large language model (LLM) query routers are critical to modern AI platforms as they seek to improve efficiency by assigning inference queries to accurate, yet low-cost models. Parametric routers typically use trained neural networks for LLM selection but suffer from retraining and maintenance overheads. Nonparametric routers are training-free, instead estimating LLM accuracy and cost via similarity between encodings of the input query and training set queries. However, like their parametric counterparts, nonparametric routers struggle to generalize to outlier queries, an issue exacerbated by limited diversity in training sets which are costly to expand and difficult to keep current with ever-evolving use cases. We propose ProxRouter, which applies an exponentially tilted aggregation mechanism to balance bias and variance in nonparametric routers, improving their robustness to outliers. Experiments show ProxRouter enhances outlier routing while preserving inlier performance with minimal overhead.

      Memory is a critical component in large language model (LLM)-based agents, enabling them to store and retrieve past executions to improve task performance over time. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on how memory management choices impact the LLM agents' behavior, especially their long-term performance. Specifically, we focus on two fundamental memory management operations that are widely used by many agent frameworks-memory addition and deletion-to systematically study their impact on the agent behavior. Through our quantitative analysis, we find that LLM agents display an experience-following property: high similarity between a task input and the input in a retrieved memory record often results in highly similar agent outputs. Our analysis further reveals two significant challenges associated with this property: error propagation, where inaccuracies in past experiences compound and degrade future performance, and misaligned experience replay, where some seemingly correct executions can provide limited or even misleading value as experiences. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate the importance of regulating experience quality within the memory bank and show that future task evaluations can serve as free quality labels for stored memory. Our findings offer insights into the behavioral dynamics of LLM agent memory systems and provide practical guidance for designing memory components that support robust, long-term agent performance.

      Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated success in generalizing across decision-making tasks including planning, control, and prediction, but their tendency to hallucinate unsafe and undesired outputs poses risks. We argue that detecting such failures is necessary, especially in safety-critical scenarios. Existing methods for black-box models often detect hallucinations by identifying inconsistencies across multiple samples. Many of these approaches typically introduce prompt perturbations like randomizing detail order or generating adversarial inputs, with the intuition that a confident model should produce stable outputs. We first perform a manual case study showing that other forms of perturbations (e.g., adding noise, removing sensor details) cause LLMs to hallucinate in a multi-agent driving environment. We then propose a novel method for efficiently searching the space of prompt perturbations using adaptive stress testing (AST) with Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS). Our AST formulation enables discovery of scenarios and prompts that cause language models to act with high uncertainty or even crash. By generating MCTS prompt perturbation trees across diverse scenarios, we show through extensive experiments that offline analyses can be used at runtime to automatically generate prompts that influence model uncertainty, and to inform real-time trust assessments of an LLM. We further characterize LLMs deployed as planners in a single-agent lunar lander environment and in a multi-agent robot crowd navigation simulation. Overall, ours is one of the first hallucination intervention algorithms to pave a path towards rigorous characterization of black-box LLM planners.

      Large language models exhibit a strong position bias in multi-document contexts, systematically prioritizing information based on location rather than relevance. While existing approaches treat this bias as noise to be mitigated, we introduce Gold Panning Bandits, a framework that leverages position bias as a diagnostic signal: by reordering documents and observing shifts in the model's responses, we can efficiently identify the most relevant content. We frame the problem of choosing reorderings as a bipartite matching problem. While an optimal assignment can be computed at each iteration with the Hungarian algorithm in $O(N^3)$ time, we propose a greedy $O(N \log N)$ strategy that achieves comparable performance by prioritizing the placement of the most uncertain documents in the most informative positions. Our approach identifies relevant documents using up to 65\% fewer language model queries than random permutation baselines on knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, substantially reducing computational cost without model retraining. This work demonstrates that inherent LLM biases can be transformed from liabilities into assets for efficient, inference-time optimization.

      Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, but still struggle with processing extensive contexts, limiting their ability to maintain coherence and accuracy over long sequences. In contrast, the human brain excels at organising and retrieving episodic experiences across vast temporal scales, spanning a lifetime. In this work, we introduce EM-LLM, a novel approach that integrates key aspects of human episodic memory and event cognition into LLMs with no fine-tuning, enabling them to handle practically infinite context lengths while maintaining computational efficiency. EM-LLM organises sequences of tokens into coherent episodic events using a combination of Bayesian surprise and graph-theoretic boundary refinement in an online fashion. When needed, these events are retrieved through a two-stage memory process, combining similarity-based and temporally contiguous retrieval for efficient, human-inspired access to relevant information. Experiments on the LongBench and $\infty$-Bench benchmarks demonstrate EM-LLM's superior performance, consistently outperforming the state-of-the-art retrieval model InfLLM across various baseline LLMs. In addition, EM-LLM outperforms its popular counterpart, RAG, in a wide range of tasks, while requiring similar resources. Notably, EM-LLM's performance even surpasses full-context models in most tasks, while successfully performing retrieval across 10 million tokens -- a scale computationally infeasible for such models. Finally, our analysis reveals strong correlations between EM-LLM's event segmentation and human-perceived events, suggesting parallels between this artificial system and its biological counterpart, thereby offering a novel computational framework for exploring human memory mechanisms.

      Machine unlearning offers a promising solution to privacy and safety concerns in large language models (LLMs) by selectively removing targeted knowledge while preserving utility. However, current methods are highly sensitive to downstream fine-tuning, which can quickly recover forgotten information-even from unrelated tasks. To address this, we introduce invariance into unlearning for the first time, inspired by invariant risk minimization (IRM). Building on this principle, we propose invariant LLM unlearning (ILU), a regularization-based framework that enhances robustness. Notably, ILU generalizes well to diverse fine-tuning tasks, even when trained using a single dataset. A task vector analysis is also provided to further elucidate the rationale behind ILU's effectiveness. Extensive experiments on the WMDP and MUSE benchmark, reveal that ILU significantly outperforms state-of-the-art unlearning methods, including negative preference optimization (NPO) and representation misdirection for unlearning (RMU). Notably, ILU achieves superior unlearning robustness across diverse downstream fine-tuning scenarios (e.g., math, paraphrase detection, and sentiment analysis) while preserving the fine-tuning performance.

      Self-improvement is among the most prominent techniques within the realm of large language models (LLM), aiming to enhance the LLM performance without relying on external data. Despite its significance, generally how LLM performances evolve during the self-improvement process remains underexplored. In this paper, we theoretically model the training dynamics of self-improvement via the concept of solver-verifier gap. This is inspired by the conjecture that the performance enhancement of self-improvement stems from the gap between LLM's solver capability and verifier capability. Based on the theoretical framework, we further show how to model the entire training trajectory. This framework allows quantifying the capability limit of self-improvement by fitting the theoretical model to the experiment results. We empirically validate the effectiveness of the theoretical framework on various LLMs and datasets. Beyond self-improvement, we extend our analysis to investigate how external data influences these dynamics within the framework. Notably, we find that under limited external data regimes, such external data can be utilized at any stage without significantly affecting final performances, which accords with the empirical observations.

      This research introduces the Judge's Verdict Benchmark, a novel two-step methodology to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) as judges for response accuracy evaluation tasks. We assess how well 54 LLMs can replicate human judgment when scoring responses from RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) or Agentic pipelines against ground truth answers. Our methodology progresses from traditional correlation analysis to comprehensive Cohen's Kappa analysis that measures actual agreement patterns. The two-step approach includes: (1) a correlation test that filters judges with strong alignment, followed by (2) a human-likeness test using z-scores to identify two distinct judgment patterns: human-like judgment (|z| < 1) that mimics natural human variation, and super-consistent judgment (z > 1) that exceeds typical human-to-human agreement levels. This methodology reveals that 27 out of 54 tested LLMs achieve Tier 1 performance: 23 models exhibit human-like patterns that preserve the nuances of human judgment, while 4 models demonstrate super-consistent behavior, a pattern that could indicate either enhanced reliability or oversimplification of complex judgments. Testing 43 open-source models (1B-405B parameters) and 11 closed models (GPT, Gemini, Claude variants), we demonstrate that judge excellence is not solely dependent on model size but on specific training strategies. Our key contributions include: (1) establishing that correlation alone is insufficient for judge evaluation, (2) introducing a "Turing Test for judges" based on agreement patterns, and (3) providing a standardized benchmark for classifying LLM judges into distinct performance tiers for different evaluation needs.

Producing explanations from large behavioral abstractions (e.g., directly-follows graphs or Petri nets) can be computationally expensive. This paper reports an exploratory evaluation of explanation quality under progressive behavioral-input reduction, where models are discovered from progressively smaller prefixes of a fixed log. Our pipeline (i) discovers models at multiple input sizes, (ii) prompts an LLM to generate explanations, and (iii) uses a second LLM to assess completeness, bottleneck identification, and suggested improvements. On synthetic logs, explanation quality is largely preserved under moderate reduction, indicating a practical cost-quality trade-off. The study is exploratory, as the scores are LLM-based (comparative signals rather than ground truth) and the data are synthetic.

Our system combines a fine-tuned layout parser to normalize diverse document formats, an inference-efficient LLM extractor based on parallel prompting and instruction tuning, and a robust two-stage automated evaluation framework supported by new benchmark datasets. Extensive experiments show that our framework significantly outperforms strong baselines in both accuracy and efficiency. In particular, we demonstrate that a fine-tuned compact 0.6B LLM achieves top-tier accuracy while significantly reducing inference latency and computational cost. The system is fully deployed in Alibaba's intelligent HR platform, supporting real-time applications across its business units.

      The integration of LLMs into software engineering has catalyzed a paradigm shift from traditional rule-based systems to sophisticated agentic systems capable of autonomous problem-solving. Despite this transformation, the field lacks a comprehensive understanding of how benchmarks and solutions interconnect, hindering systematic progress and evaluation. This survey presents the first holistic analysis of LLM-empowered software engineering, bridging the critical gap between evaluation and solution approaches. We analyze 150+ recent papers and organize them into a comprehensive taxonomy spanning two major dimensions: (1) Solutions, categorized into prompt-based, fine-tuning-based, and agent-based paradigms, and (2) Benchmarks, covering code generation, translation, repair, and other tasks. Our analysis reveals how the field has evolved from simple prompt engineering to complex agentic systems incorporating planning and decomposition, reasoning and self-refinement, memory mechanisms, and tool augmentation. We present a unified pipeline that illustrates the complete workflow from task specification to final deliverables, demonstrating how different solution paradigms address varying complexity levels across software engineering tasks. Unlike existing surveys that focus on isolated aspects, we provide full-spectrum coverage connecting 50+ benchmarks with their corresponding solution strategies, enabling researchers to identify optimal approaches for specific evaluation criteria. Furthermore, we identify critical research gaps and propose actionable future directions, including multi-agent collaboration frameworks, self-evolving code generation systems, and integration of formal verification with LLM-based methods. This survey serves as a foundational resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to understand, evaluate, and advance LLM-empowered software engineering systems.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      One of the key factors influencing the reasoning capabilities of LLM-based agents is their ability to leverage long-term memory. Integrating long-term memory mechanisms allows agents to make informed decisions grounded in historical interactions. While recent advances have significantly improved the storage and retrieval components, by encoding memory into dense vectors for similarity search or organizing memory as structured knowledge graphs most existing approaches fall short in memory updating. In particular, they lack mechanisms for dynamically refining preference memory representations in response to evolving user behaviors and contexts. To address this gap, we propose a Preference-Aware Memory Update Mechanism (PAMU) that enables dynamic and personalized memory refinement. By integrating sliding window averages (SW) with exponential moving averages (EMA), PAMU constructs a fused preference-aware representation that captures both short-term fluctuations and long-term user tendencies. We conduct experiments on five task scenarios of the LoCoMo dataset, and the results show that our mechanism can significantly improve the output quality of LLM in five baselines, validating its effectiveness in long-term conversations.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit complementary strengths. Model routing harnesses these strengths by dynamically directing each query to the most suitable model, given a candidate model pool. However, routing performance relies on accurate model representations, and adding new models typically requires retraining, limiting scalability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel routing method using in-context vectors to represent model capabilities. The method proceeds in two stages. First, queries are embedded and projected into vectors, with a projector and LLM-based router trained to reconstruct the original queries, aligning vector representations with the router's semantic space. Second, each candidate model is profiled on a query set, and the router learns -- based on in-context vectors of query and model performance -- to predict whether each model can correctly answer new queries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art routing performance in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks. Moreover, our method allows for seamless integration of new models without retraining the router. The code is available at https://github.com/lalalamdbf/ICL-Router.

      Recent large language models (LLMs) have increasingly adopted the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture for efficiency. MoE-based LLMs heavily depend on a superficial safety mechanism in which harmful inputs are routed safety-critical experts. However, our analysis reveals that routing decisions for harmful inputs drift significantly after fine-tuning, exposing a critical vulnerability to harmful fine-tuning (HFT) attacks. Existing defenses, primarily designed for monolithic LLMs, are less effective for MoE LLMs as they fail to prevent drift in harmful input routing. To address this limitation, we propose SafeMoE, a safe fine-tuning method tailored to MoE LLMs. SafeMoE directly mitigates routing drift by penalizing the gap between the routing weights of a fine-tuned model and those of the initial safety-aligned model, thereby preserving the safety-aligned routing of harmful inputs to safety-critical experts. Experiments on open-source MoE LLMs ranging from 7B to 141B parameters demonstrate that SafeMoE effectively mitigates HFT attacks, reducing the harmfulness score of OLMoE from 62.0 to 5.0, for example, while maintaining task utility within 1% degradation and incurring only 2% overhead. It significantly outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods for safeguarding LLM fine-tuning and remains effective in recent large-scale MoE LLMs such as gpt-oss and Llama 4. Our implementation is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SafeMoE.

      Recent studies have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, where malicious training examples embed hidden behaviours triggered by specific input patterns. However, most existing works assume a phrase and focus on the attack's effectiveness, offering limited understanding of trigger mechanisms and how multiple triggers interact within the model. In this paper, we present a framework for studying poisoning in LLMs. We show that multiple distinct backdoor triggers can coexist within a single model without interfering with each other, enabling adversaries to embed several triggers concurrently. Using multiple triggers with high embedding similarity, we demonstrate that poisoned triggers can achieve robust activation even when tokens are substituted or separated by long token spans. Our findings expose a broader and more persistent vulnerability surface in LLMs. To mitigate this threat, we propose a post hoc recovery method that selectively retrains specific model components based on a layer-wise weight difference analysis. Our method effectively removes the trigger behaviour with minimal parameter updates, presenting a practical and efficient defence against multi-trigger poisoning.

      Advances in large language models (LLMs) and real-time speech recognition now make it possible to issue any graphical user interface (GUI) action through natural language and receive the corresponding system response directly through the GUI. Most production applications were never designed with speech in mind. This article provides a concrete architecture that enables GUIs to interface with LLM-based speech-enabled assistants. The architecture makes an application's navigation graph and semantics available through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The ViewModel, part of the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern, exposes the application's capabilities to the assistant by supplying both tools applicable to a currently visible view and application-global tools extracted from the GUI tree router. This architecture facilitates full voice accessibility while ensuring reliable alignment between spoken input and the visual interface, accompanied by consistent feedback across modalities. It future-proofs apps for upcoming OS super assistants that employ computer use agents (CUAs) and natively consume MCP if an application provides it. To address concerns about privacy and data security, the practical effectiveness of locally deployable, open-weight LLMs for speech-enabled multimodal UIs is evaluated. Findings suggest that recent smaller open-weight models approach the performance of leading proprietary models in overall accuracy and require enterprise-grade hardware for fast responsiveness.

      Large language models (LLMs) frequently produce false refusals, declining benign requests that contain terms resembling unsafe queries. We address this challenge by introducing two comprehensive benchmarks: the Exaggerated Safety Benchmark (XSB) for single-turn prompts, annotated with "Focus" keywords that identify refusal-inducing triggers, and the Multi-turn Scenario-based Exaggerated Safety Benchmark (MS-XSB), which systematically evaluates refusal calibration in realistic, context-rich dialog settings. Our benchmarks reveal that exaggerated refusals persist across diverse recent LLMs and are especially pronounced in complex, multi-turn scenarios. To mitigate these failures, we leverage post-hoc explanation methods to identify refusal triggers and deploy three lightweight, model-agnostic approaches, ignore-word instructions, prompt rephrasing, and attention steering, at inference time, all without retraining or parameter access. Experiments on four instruction-tuned Llama models demonstrate that these strategies substantially improve compliance on safe prompts while maintaining robust safety protections. Our findings establish a reproducible framework for diagnosing and mitigating exaggerated refusals, highlighting practical pathways to safer and more helpful LLM deployments.

      Logical reasoning is a core capability for large language models (LLMs), yet existing benchmarks that rely solely on final-answer accuracy fail to capture the quality of the reasoning process. To address this, we introduce FineLogic, a fine-grained evaluation framework that assesses logical reasoning across three dimensions: overall accuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level probing. Leveraging this framework, we conduct a comprehensive study on how different supervision formats in fine-tuning shape reasoning abilities. We fine-tune LLMs on four supervision styles: one in natural language and three symbolic variants. We find a key trade-off: natural language supervision excels at generalization to out-of-distribution and long-chain problems, whereas symbolic supervision is superior at instilling structurally sound, atomic reasoning steps. Furthermore, our probing analysis indicates that fine-tuning primarily refines the model's step-by-step generation process, rather than improving its ability to converge on an answer early. Together, our framework and analysis provide a more rigorous lens for evaluating and improving logical reasoning in LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/YujunZhou/FineLogic.

      Using LLMs to evaluate text, that is, LLM-as-a-judge, is increasingly being used at scale to augment or even replace human annotations. As such, it is imperative that we understand the potential biases and risks of doing so. In this work, we propose an approach for extracting high-level concept-based global policies from LLM-as-a-Judge. Our approach consists of two algorithms: 1) CLoVE (Contrastive Local Verifiable Explanations), which generates verifiable, concept-based, contrastive local explanations and 2) GloVE (Global Verifiable Explanations), which uses iterative clustering, summarization and verification to condense local rules into a global policy. We evaluate GloVE on seven standard benchmarking datasets for content harm detection. We find that the extracted global policies are highly faithful to decisions of the LLM-as-a-Judge. Additionally, we evaluated the robustness of global policies to text perturbations and adversarial attacks. Finally, we conducted a user study to evaluate user understanding and satisfaction with global policies.

      Rapid advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred demand for processing extended context sequences in contemporary applications. However, this progress faces two challenges: performance degradation due to sequence lengths out-of-distribution, and excessively long inference times caused by the quadratic computational complexity of attention. These issues limit LLMs in long-context scenarios. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Token-Level KV Cache Selection (TokenSelect), a training-free method for efficient and accurate long-context inference. TokenSelect builds upon the observation of non-contiguous attention sparsity, using QK dot products to measure per-head KV Cache criticality at token-level. By per-head soft voting mechanism, TokenSelect selectively involves a few critical KV cache tokens in attention calculation without sacrificing accuracy. To further accelerate TokenSelect, we design the Selection Cache based on observations of consecutive Query similarity and implemented the efficient Paged Dot Product Kernel, significantly reducing the selection overhead. A comprehensive evaluation of TokenSelect demonstrates up to $23.84\times$ speedup in attention computation and up to $2.28\times$ acceleration in end-to-end latency, while providing superior performance compared to state-of-the-art long-context inference methods.

      The rise of influencer marketing has blurred boundaries between organic content and sponsored content, making the enforcement of legal rules relating to transparency challenging. Effective regulation requires applying legal knowledge with a clear purpose and reason, yet current detection methods of undisclosed sponsored content generally lack legal grounding or operate as opaque "black boxes". Using 1,143 Instagram posts, we compare gpt-5-nano and gemini-2.5-flash-lite under three prompting strategies with controlled levels of legal knowledge provided. Both models perform strongly in classifying content as sponsored or not (F1 up to 0.93), though performance drops by over 10 points on ambiguous cases. We further develop a taxonomy of reasoning errors, showing frequent citation omissions (28.57%), unclear references (20.71%), and hidden ads exhibiting the highest miscue rate (28.57%). While adding regulatory text to the prompt improves explanation quality, it does not consistently improve detection accuracy. The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, it makes a novel addition to regulatory compliance technology by providing a taxonomy of common errors in LLM-generated legal reasoning to evaluate whether automated moderation is not only accurate but also legally robust, thereby advancing the transparent detection of influencer marketing content. Second, it features an original dataset of LLM explanations annotated by two students who were trained in influencer marketing law. Third, it combines quantitative and qualitative evaluation strategies for LLM explanations and critically reflects on how these findings can support advertising regulatory bodies in automating moderation processes on a solid legal foundation.

      Web measurements are a well-established methodology for assessing the security and privacy landscape of the Internet. However, existing top lists of popular websites commonly used as measurement targets are unlabeled and lack semantic information about the nature of the sites they include. This limitation makes targeted measurements challenging, as researchers often need to rely on ad-hoc techniques to bias their datasets toward specific categories of interest. In this paper, we investigate the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as a means to enable targeted web measurement studies through their semantic understanding capabilities. Building on prior literature, we identify key website classification tasks relevant to web measurements and construct datasets to systematically evaluate the performance of different LLMs on these tasks. Our results demonstrate that LLMs may achieve strong performance across multiple classification scenarios. We then conduct LLM-assisted web measurement studies inspired by prior work and rigorously assess the validity of the resulting research inferences. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can serve as a practical tool for analyzing security and privacy trends on the Web.

      Ranking online reviews by their intrinsic quality is a critical task for e-commerce platforms and information services, impacting user experience and business outcomes. However, quality is a domain-dependent and dynamic concept, making its assessment a formidable challenge. Traditional methods relying on hand-crafted features are unscalable across domains and fail to adapt to evolving content patterns, while modern deep learning approaches often produce black-box models that lack interpretability and may prioritize semantics over quality. To address these challenges, we propose AutoQual, an LLM-based agent framework that automates the discovery of interpretable features. While demonstrated on review quality assessment, AutoQual is designed as a general framework for transforming tacit knowledge embedded in data into explicit, computable features.

Converting it into structured format, for example through recursive extraction approaches such as the GPTKB methodology (Hu et al., 2025b), is still underexplored. Key open questions include whether such extraction can terminate, whether its outputs are reproducible, and how robust they are to variations. We systematically study LLM knowledge materialization using miniGPTKBs (domain-specific, tractable subcrawls), analyzing termination, reproducibility, and robustness across three categories of metrics: yield, lexical similarity, and semantic similarity. We experiment with four variations (seed, language, randomness, model) and three illustrative domains (from history, entertainment, and finance). Our findings show (i) high termination rates, though model-dependent; (ii) mixed reproducibility; and (iii) robustness that varies by perturbation type: high for seeds and temperature, lower for languages and models.

      Large Language Model (LLM) inference in production must meet stringent service-level objectives for both time-to-first-token (TTFT) and time-between-token (TBT) while maximizing throughput under fixed compute, memory, and interconnect budgets. Modern serving systems adopt stall-free scheduling techniques such as chunked prefill, which splits long prompt processing along the token dimension and interleaves prefill with ongoing decode iterations. While effective at stabilizing TBT, chunked prefill incurs substantial overhead in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models: redundant expert weight loads increase memory traffic by up to 39% and inflate energy consumption. We propose layered prefill, a new scheduling paradigm that treats transformer layer groups as the primary scheduling unit. By vertically partitioning the model into contiguous layer groups and interleaving prefill and decode across the groups, layered prefill sustains stall-free decoding while eliminating chunk-induced MoE weight reloads. It reduces off-chip bandwidth demand, lowering TTFT by up to 70%, End-to-End latency by 41% and per-token energy by up to 22%. Evaluations show that layered prefill consistently improves the TTFT--TBT Pareto frontier over chunked prefill, reducing expert-load traffic and energy cost while maintaining stall-free decoding. Overall, shifting the scheduling axis from tokens to layers unlocks a new operating regime for high-efficiency, energy-aware LLM serving in co-located environments.

      Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate advanced reasoning abilities, enabling robots to understand natural language instructions and generate high-level plans with appropriate grounding. However, LLM hallucinations present a significant challenge, often leading to overconfident yet potentially misaligned or unsafe plans. While researchers have explored uncertainty estimation to improve the reliability of LLM-based planning, existing studies have not sufficiently differentiated between epistemic and intrinsic uncertainty, limiting the effectiveness of uncertainty estimation. In this paper, we present Combined Uncertainty estimation for Reliable Embodied planning (CURE), which decomposes the uncertainty into epistemic and intrinsic uncertainty, each estimated separately. Furthermore, epistemic uncertainty is subdivided into task clarity and task familiarity for more accurate evaluation. The overall uncertainty assessments are obtained using random network distillation and multi-layer perceptron regression heads driven by LLM features. We validated our approach in two distinct experimental settings: kitchen manipulation and tabletop rearrangement experiments. The results show that, compared to existing methods, our approach yields uncertainty estimates that are more closely aligned with the actual execution outcomes.

      Machine learning models are known to leak sensitive information, as they inevitably memorize (parts of) their training data. More alarmingly, large language models (LLMs) are now trained on nearly all available data, which amplifies the magnitude of information leakage and raises serious privacy risks. Hence, it is more crucial than ever to quantify privacy risk before the release of LLMs. The standard method to quantify privacy is via membership inference attacks, where the state-of-the-art approach is the Robust Membership Inference Attack (RMIA). In this paper, we present InfoRMIA, a principled information-theoretic formulation of membership inference. Our method consistently outperforms RMIA across benchmarks while also offering improved computational efficiency. In the second part of the paper, we identify the limitations of treating sequence-level membership inference as the gold standard for measuring leakage. We propose a new perspective for studying membership and memorization in LLMs: token-level signals and analyses. We show that a simple token-based InfoRMIA can pinpoint which tokens are memorized within generated outputs, thereby localizing leakage from the sequence level down to individual tokens, while achieving stronger sequence-level inference power on LLMs. This new scope rethinks privacy in LLMs and can lead to more targeted mitigation, such as exact unlearning.

      Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) Large Language Models (LLM) fundamentally rely on high-quality training data. While data selection and data synthesis are two common strategies to improve data quality, existing approaches often face limitations in static dataset curation that fail to adapt to evolving model capabilities. In this paper, we introduce Middo, a self-evolving Model-informed dynamic data optimization framework that uses model-aware data selection and context-preserving data refinement. Unlike conventional one-off filtering/synthesis methods, our framework establishes a closed-loop optimization system: (1) A self-referential diagnostic module proactively identifies suboptimal samples through tri-axial model signals - loss patterns (complexity), embedding cluster dynamics (diversity), and self-alignment scores (quality); (2) An adaptive optimization engine then transforms suboptimal samples into pedagogically valuable training points while preserving semantic integrity; (3) This optimization process continuously evolves with model capability through dynamic learning principles. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our Middo consistently enhances the quality of seed data and boosts LLM's performance with improving accuracy by 7.15% on average while maintaining the original dataset scale. This work establishes a new paradigm for sustainable LLM training through dynamic human-AI co-evolution of data and models.

      Reducing the key-value (KV) cache burden in Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly accelerates inference. Dynamically selecting critical KV caches during decoding helps maintain performance. Existing methods use random linear hashing to identify important tokens, but this approach is inefficient due to the orthogonal distribution of queries and keys within two narrow cones in LLMs. We introduce Spotlight Attention, a novel method that employs non-linear hashing functions to optimize the embedding distribution of queries and keys, enhancing coding efficiency and robustness. We also developed a lightweight, stable training framework using a Bradley-Terry ranking-based loss, enabling optimization of the non-linear hashing module on GPUs with 16GB memory in 8 hours. Experimental results show that Spotlight Attention drastically improves retrieval precision while shortening the length of the hash code at least 5$\times$ compared to traditional linear hashing. Finally, we exploit the computational advantages of bitwise operations by implementing specialized CUDA kernels, achieving hashing retrieval for 512K tokens in under 100$\mu$s on a single A100 GPU, with end-to-end throughput up to 3$\times$ higher than vanilla decoding.

      Model pruning, i.e., removing a subset of model weights, has become a prominent approach to reducing the memory footprint of large language models (LLMs) during inference. Notably, popular inference engines, such as vLLM, enable users to conveniently prune downloaded models before they are deployed. While the utility and efficiency of pruning methods have improved significantly, the security implications of pruning remain underexplored. In this work, for the first time, we show that modern LLM pruning methods can be maliciously exploited. In particular, an adversary can construct a model that appears benign yet, once pruned, exhibits malicious behaviors. Our method is based on the idea that the adversary can compute a proxy metric that estimates how likely each parameter is to be pruned. With this information, the adversary can first inject a malicious behavior into those parameters that are unlikely to be pruned. Then, they can repair the model by using parameters that are likely to be pruned, effectively canceling out the injected behavior in the unpruned model. We demonstrate the severity of our attack through extensive evaluation on five models; after any of the pruning in vLLM are applied (Magnitude, Wanda, and SparseGPT), it consistently exhibits strong malicious behaviors in a diverse set of attack scenarios (success rates of up to $95.7\%$ for jailbreak, $98.7\%$ for benign instruction refusal, and $99.5\%$ for targeted content injection). Our results reveal a critical deployment-time security gap and underscore the urgent need for stronger security awareness in model compression.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across various applications, but their deployment in sensitive domains raises significant concerns. To mitigate these risks, numerous defense strategies have been proposed. However, most existing studies assess these defenses in isolation, overlooking their broader impacts across other risk dimensions. In this work, we take the first step in investigating unintended interactions caused by defenses in LLMs, focusing on the complex interplay between safety, fairness, and privacy. Specifically, we propose CrossRiskEval, a comprehensive evaluation framework to assess whether deploying a defense targeting one risk inadvertently affects others. Through extensive empirical studies on 14 defense-deployed LLMs, covering 12 distinct defense strategies, we reveal several alarming side effects: 1) safety defenses may suppress direct responses to sensitive queries related to bias or privacy, yet still amplify indirect privacy leakage or biased outputs; 2) fairness defenses increase the risk of misuse and privacy leakage; 3) privacy defenses often impair safety and exacerbate bias. We further conduct a fine-grained neuron-level analysis to uncover the underlying mechanisms of these phenomena. Our analysis reveals the existence of conflict-entangled neurons in LLMs that exhibit opposing sensitivities across multiple risk dimensions. Further trend consistency analysis at both task and neuron levels confirms that these neurons play a key role in mediating the emergence of unintended behaviors following defense deployment. We call for a paradigm shift in LLM risk evaluation, toward holistic, interaction-aware assessment of defense strategies.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are predominantly evaluated on Standard American English (SAE), often overlooking the diversity of global English varieties. This narrow focus may raise fairness concerns as degraded performance on non-standard varieties can lead to unequal benefits for users worldwide. Therefore, it is critical to extensively evaluate the linguistic robustness of LLMs on multiple non-standard English varieties. We introduce Trans-EnV, a framework that automatically transforms SAE datasets into multiple English varieties to evaluate the linguistic robustness. Our framework combines (1) linguistics expert knowledge to curate variety-specific features and transformation guidelines from linguistic literature and corpora, and (2) LLM-based transformations to ensure both linguistic validity and scalability. Using Trans-EnV, we transform six benchmark datasets into 38 English varieties and evaluate seven state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results reveal significant performance disparities, with accuracy decreasing by up to 46.3% on non-standard varieties. These findings highlight the importance of comprehensive linguistic robustness evaluation across diverse English varieties. Each construction of Trans-EnV was validated through rigorous statistical testing and consultation with a researcher in the field of second language acquisition, ensuring its linguistic validity. Our code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/jiyounglee-0523/TransEnV and https://huggingface.co/collections/jiyounglee0523/transenv-681eadb3c0c8cf363b363fb1.
