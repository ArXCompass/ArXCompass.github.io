      Despite the significant potential of FP8 data formats for large language model (LLM) pre-training, their adoption has been limited due to challenges in maintaining stability at scale. Existing approaches often rely on suboptimal fine-grained FP8 kernels or fall back to higher-precision matrix multiplications (GEMMs) in sensitive components, such as attention projections, compromising potential throughput gains. We introduce a new class of LLM architectures that, for the first time, support FP8 computation for all GEMMs within transformer blocks during both forward and backward passes. This enables unprecedented throughput gains, particularly at scale, while matching the downstream performance of standard BF16 training. Our architecture design reduces large outlier activations, promoting stable long-term FP8 training. In addition, we identify key metrics to monitor low-precision training and predict potential future divergences.

      Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on reasoning benchmarks like math and logic. While many works have largely assumed well-defined tasks, real-world queries are often underspecified and only solvable by acquiring missing information. We formalize this information-gathering problem as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) with missing variable assignments. Using a special case where only one necessary variable assignment is missing, we can evaluate an LLM's ability to identify the minimal necessary question to ask. We present QuestBench, a set of underspecified reasoning tasks solvable by asking at most one question, which includes: (1) Logic-Q: logical reasoning tasks with one missing proposition, (2) Planning-Q: PDDL planning problems with partially-observed initial states, (3) GSM-Q: human-annotated grade school math problems with one unknown variable, and (4) GSME-Q: equation-based version of GSM-Q. The LLM must select the correct clarification question from multiple options. While current models excel at GSM-Q and GSME-Q, they achieve only 40-50% accuracy on Logic-Q and Planning-Q. Analysis shows that the ability to solve well-specified reasoning problems is not sufficient for success on our benchmark: models struggle to identify the right question even when they can solve the fully specified version. This highlights the need for specifically optimizing models' information acquisition capabilities.

      Although Rust ensures memory safety by default, it also permits the use of unsafe code, which can introduce memory safety vulnerabilities if misused. Unfortunately, existing tools for detecting memory bugs in Rust typically exhibit limited detection capabilities, inadequately handle Rust-specific types, or rely heavily on manual intervention. To address these limitations, we present deepSURF, a tool that integrates static analysis with Large Language Model (LLM)-guided fuzzing harness generation to effectively identify memory safety vulnerabilities in Rust libraries, specifically targeting unsafe code. deepSURF introduces a novel approach for handling generics by substituting them with custom types and generating tailored implementations for the required traits, enabling the fuzzer to simulate user-defined behaviors within the fuzzed library. Additionally, deepSURF employs LLMs to augment fuzzing harnesses dynamically, facilitating exploration of complex API interactions and significantly increasing the likelihood of exposing memory safety vulnerabilities. We evaluated deepSURF on 63 real-world Rust crates, successfully rediscovering 30 known memory safety bugs and uncovering 12 previously-unknown vulnerabilities (out of which 11 have been assigned RustSec IDs and 3 have been patched), demonstrating clear improvements over state-of-the-art tools.

      Large language models (LLMs) can already identify patterns and reason effectively, yet their variable accuracy hampers adoption in high-stakes decision-making applications. In this paper, we study this issue from a venture capital perspective by predicting idea-stage startup success based on founder traits. (i) To build a reliable prediction model, we introduce LLM-AR, a pipeline inspired by neural-symbolic systems that distils LLM-generated heuristics into probabilistic rules executed by the ProbLog automated-reasoning engine. (ii) An iterative policy-evolution loop incorporates association-rule mining to progressively refine the prediction rules. On unseen folds, LLM-AR achieves 59.5% precision and 8.7% recall, 5.9x the random baseline precision, while exposing every decision path for human inspection. The framework is interpretable and tunable via hyperparameters, showing promise to extend into other domains.

      Despite their many successes, transformer-based large language models (LLMs) continue to struggle with tasks that require complex reasoning over large parts of their input. We argue that these failures arise due to capacity limits on the accurate flow of information within LLMs. To formalize this issue, we introduce the bounded attention prefix oracle (BAPO) model, a new computational framework that models bandwidth constraints on attention heads, the mechanism for internal communication in LLMs. We show that several important reasoning problems like graph reachability require high communication bandwidth for BAPOs to solve; we call these problems BAPO-hard. Our experiments corroborate our theoretical predictions: GPT-4o, Claude, and Gemini succeed on BAPO-easy tasks and fail even on relatively small BAPO-hard tasks. BAPOs also reveal another benefit of chain of thought (CoT): we prove that breaking down a task using CoT can turn any BAPO-hard problem into a BAPO-easy one. Our results offer principled explanations for key LLM failures and suggest directions for architectures and inference methods that mitigate bandwidth limits.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Large Language Models (LLMs) are now integral across various domains and have demonstrated impressive performance. Progress, however, rests on the premise that benchmark scores are both accurate and reproducible. We demonstrate that the reproducibility of LLM performance is fragile: changing system configuration, such as evaluation batch size, GPU count, and GPU version, can introduce significant differences in the generated responses. This issue is especially pronounced in reasoning models, where minor rounding differences in early tokens can cascade into divergent chains of thought, ultimately affecting accuracy. For instance, under bfloat16 precision with greedy decoding, a reasoning model like DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B can exhibit up to 9% variation in accuracy and 9,000 tokens difference in response length due to differences in GPU count, type, and evaluation batch size. We trace the root cause of this variability to the non-associative nature of floating-point arithmetic under limited numerical precision. This work presents the first systematic investigation into how numerical precision affects reproducibility in LLM inference. Through carefully controlled experiments across various hardware, software, and precision settings, we quantify when and how model outputs diverge. Our analysis reveals that floating-point precision - while critical for reproducibility - is often neglected in evaluation practices. Inspired by this, we develop a lightweight inference pipeline, dubbed LayerCast, that stores weights in 16-bit precision but performs all computations in FP32, balancing memory efficiency with numerical stability.

      Natural Language Recommendation (NLRec) generates item suggestions based on the relevance between user-issued NL requests and NL item description passages. Existing NLRec approaches often use Dense Retrieval (DR) to compute item relevance scores from aggregation of inner products between user request embeddings and relevant passage embeddings. However, DR views the request as the sole relevance label, thus leading to a unimodal scoring function centered on the query embedding that is often a weak proxy for query relevance. To better capture the potential multimodal distribution of the relevance scoring function that may arise from complex NLRec data, we propose GPR-LLM that uses Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with LLM relevance judgments for a subset of candidate passages. Experiments on four NLRec datasets and two LLM backbones demonstrate that GPR-LLM with an RBF kernel, capable of modeling multimodal relevance scoring functions, consistently outperforms simpler unimodal kernels (dot product, cosine similarity), as well as baseline methods including DR, cross-encoder, and pointwise LLM-based relevance scoring by up to 65%. Overall, GPR-LLM provides an efficient and effective approach to NLRec within a minimal LLM labeling budget.

      Curriculum learning (CL) - ordering training data from easy to hard - has become a popular strategy for improving reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Yet prior work employs disparate difficulty metrics and training setups, leaving open fundamental questions: When does curriculum help? Which direction - forward or reverse - is better? And does the answer depend on what we measure? We address these questions through a unified offline evaluation framework that decomposes curriculum difficulty into five complementary dimensions: Problem Difficulty, Model Surprisal, Confidence Margin, Predictive Uncertainty, and Decision Variability. Through controlled post-training experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks with Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, and Gemma3-4B, we find that (i) no curriculum strategy dominates universally - the relative effectiveness of forward versus reverse CL depends jointly on model capability and task complexity; (ii) even within a single metric, samples at different difficulty levels produce distinct gains depending on task demands; and (iii) task-aligned curricula focus on shaping the model's final representations and generalization, whereas inner-state curricula modulate internal states such as confidence and uncertainty. Our findings challenge the notion of a universal curriculum strategy and offer actionable guidance across model and task regimes, with some metrics indicating that prioritizing decision-uncertain samples can further enhance learning outcomes.

      Agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in a wide range of complex, real-world applications. However, LLM agents with a compromised memory bank may easily produce harmful outputs when the past records retrieved for demonstration are malicious. In this paper, we propose a novel Memory INJection Attack, MINJA, without assuming that the attacker can directly modify the memory bank of the agent. The attacker injects malicious records into the memory bank by only interacting with the agent via queries and output observations. These malicious records are designed to elicit a sequence of malicious reasoning steps corresponding to a different target query during the agent's execution of the victim user's query. Specifically, we introduce a sequence of bridging steps to link victim queries to the malicious reasoning steps. During the memory injection, we propose an indication prompt that guides the agent to autonomously generate similar bridging steps, with a progressive shortening strategy that gradually removes the indication prompt, such that the malicious record will be easily retrieved when processing later victim queries. Our extensive experiments across diverse agents demonstrate the effectiveness of MINJA in compromising agent memory. With minimal requirements for execution, MINJA enables any user to influence agent memory, highlighting the risk.

      Large language models (LLMs) have recently transformed from text-based assistants to autonomous agents capable of planning, reasoning, and iteratively improving their actions. While numerical reward signals and verifiers can effectively rank candidate actions, they often provide limited contextual guidance. In contrast, natural language feedback better aligns with the generative capabilities of LLMs, providing richer and more actionable suggestions. However, parsing and implementing this feedback effectively can be challenging for LLM-based agents. In this work, we introduce Critique-Guided Improvement (CGI), a novel two-player framework, comprising an actor model that explores an environment and a critic model that generates detailed nature language feedback. By training the critic to produce fine-grained assessments and actionable revisions, and the actor to utilize these critiques, our approach promotes more robust exploration of alternative strategies while avoiding local optima. Experiments in three interactive environments show that CGI outperforms existing baselines by a substantial margin. Notably, even a small critic model surpasses GPT-4 in feedback quality. The resulting actor achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating the power of explicit iterative guidance to enhance decision-making in LLM-based agents.

      Despite recent advances, Large Language Models remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass alignment safeguards and elicit harmful outputs. While prior research has proposed various attack strategies differing in human readability and transferability, little attention has been paid to the linguistic and psychological mechanisms that may influence a model's susceptibility to such attacks. In this paper, we examine an interdisciplinary line of research that leverages foundational theories of persuasion from the social sciences to craft adversarial prompts capable of circumventing alignment constraints in LLMs. Drawing on well-established persuasive strategies, we hypothesize that LLMs, having been trained on large-scale human-generated text, may respond more compliantly to prompts with persuasive structures. Furthermore, we investigate whether LLMs themselves exhibit distinct persuasive fingerprints that emerge in their jailbreak responses. Empirical evaluations across multiple aligned LLMs reveal that persuasion-aware prompts significantly bypass safeguards, demonstrating their potential to induce jailbreak behaviors. This work underscores the importance of cross-disciplinary insight in addressing the evolving challenges of LLM safety. The code and data are available.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising way to simulate human survey responses, potentially reducing the cost of large-scale data collection. However, existing zero-shot methods suffer from prompt sensitivity and low accuracy, while conventional fine-tuning approaches mostly fit the training set distributions and struggle to produce results more accurate than the training set itself, which deviates from the original goal of using LLMs to simulate survey responses. Building on this observation, we introduce Distribution Shift Alignment (DSA), a two-stage fine-tuning method that aligns both the output distributions and the distribution shifts across different backgrounds. By learning how these distributions change rather than fitting training data, DSA can provide results substantially closer to the true distribution than the training data. Empirically, DSA consistently outperforms other methods on five public survey datasets. We further conduct a comprehensive comparison covering accuracy, robustness, and data savings. DSA reduces the required real data by 53.48-69.12%, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency in survey simulation.

      Designing institutions for social-ecological systems requires models that capture heterogeneity, uncertainty, and strategic interaction. Multiple modeling approaches have emerged to meet this challenge, including empirical game-theoretic analysis (EGTA), which merges ABM's scale and diversity with game-theoretic models' formal equilibrium analysis. The newly popular class of LLM-driven simulations provides yet another approach, and it is not clear how these approaches can be integrated with one another, nor whether the resulting simulations produce a plausible range of behaviours for real-world social-ecological governance. To address this gap, we compare four LLM-augmented frameworks: procedural ABMs, generative ABMs, LLM-EGTA, and expert guided LLM-EGTA, and evaluate them on a real-world case study of irrigation and fishing in the Amu Darya basin under centralized and decentralized governance. Our results show: first, procedural ABMs, generative ABMs, and LLM-augmented EGTA models produce strikingly different patterns of collective behaviour, highlighting the value of methodological diversity. Second, inducing behaviour through system prompts in LLMs is less effective than shaping behaviour through parameterized payoffs in an expert-guided EGTA-based model.

      Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities across various tasks. However, their deployment introduces significant risks related to intellectual property. In this context, we focus on model stealing attacks, where adversaries replicate the behaviors of these models to steal services. These attacks are highly relevant to proprietary LLMs and pose serious threats to revenue and financial stability. To mitigate these risks, the watermarking solution embeds imperceptible patterns in LLM outputs, enabling model traceability and intellectual property verification. In this paper, we study the vulnerability of LLM service providers by introducing $\delta$-STEAL, a novel model stealing attack that bypasses the service provider's watermark detectors while preserving the adversary's model utility. $\delta$-STEAL injects noise into the token embeddings of the adversary's model during fine-tuning in a way that satisfies local differential privacy (LDP) guarantees. The adversary queries the service provider's model to collect outputs and form input-output training pairs. By applying LDP-preserving noise to these pairs, $\delta$-STEAL obfuscates watermark signals, making it difficult for the service provider to determine whether its outputs were used, thereby preventing claims of model theft. Our experiments show that $\delta$-STEAL with lightweight modifications achieves attack success rates of up to $96.95\%$ without significantly compromising the adversary's model utility. The noise scale in LDP controls the trade-off between attack effectiveness and model utility. This poses a significant risk, as even robust watermarks can be bypassed, allowing adversaries to deceive watermark detectors and undermine current intellectual property protection methods.

      DeFi (Decentralized Finance) is one of the most important applications of today's cryptocurrencies and smart contracts. It manages hundreds of billions in Total Value Locked (TVL) on-chain, yet it remains susceptible to common DeFi price manipulation attacks. Despite state-of-the-art (SOTA) systems like DeFiRanger and DeFort, we found that they are less effective to non-standard price models in custom DeFi protocols, which account for 44.2% of the 95 DeFi price manipulation attacks reported over the past three years. In this paper, we introduce the first LLM-based approach, DeFiScope, for detecting DeFi price manipulation attacks in both standard and custom price models. Our insight is that large language models (LLMs) have certain intelligence to abstract price calculation from smart contract source code and infer the trend of token price changes based on the extracted price models. To further strengthen LLMs in this aspect, we leverage Foundry to synthesize on-chain data and use it to fine-tune a DeFi price-specific LLM. Together with the high-level DeFi operations recovered from low-level transaction data, DeFiScope detects various DeFi price manipulations according to systematically mined patterns. Experimental results show that DeFiScope achieves a high recall of 80% on real-world attacks, a precision of 96% on suspicious transactions, and zero false alarms on benign transactions, significantly outperforming SOTA approaches. Moreover, we evaluate DeFiScope's cost-effectiveness and demonstrate its practicality by helping our industry partner confirm 147 real-world price manipulation attacks, including discovering 81 previously unknown historical incidents.

      Despite their remarkable reasoning capabilities across diverse domains, large language models (LLMs) face fundamental challenges in natively functioning as generative reasoning recommendation models (GRRMs), where the intrinsic modeling gap between textual semantics and collaborative filtering signals, combined with the sparsity and stochasticity of user feedback, presents significant obstacles. This work explores how to build GRRMs by adapting pre-trained LLMs, which achieves a unified understanding-reasoning-prediction manner for recommendation tasks. We propose GREAM, an end-to-end framework that integrates three components: (i) Collaborative-Semantic Alignment, which fuses heterogeneous textual evidence to construct semantically consistent, discrete item indices and auxiliary alignment tasks that ground linguistic representations in interaction semantics; (ii) Reasoning Curriculum Activation, which builds a synthetic dataset with explicit Chain-of-Thought supervision and a curriculum that progresses through behavioral evidence extraction, latent preference modeling, intent inference, recommendation formulation, and denoised sequence rewriting; and (iii) Sparse-Regularized Group Policy Optimization (SRPO), which stabilizes post-training via Residual-Sensitive Verifiable Reward and Bonus-Calibrated Group Advantage Estimation, enabling end-to-end optimization under verifiable signals despite sparse successes. GREAM natively supports two complementary inference modes: Direct Sequence Recommendation for high-throughput, low-latency deployment, and Sequential Reasoning Recommendation that first emits an interpretable reasoning chain for causal transparency. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate consistent gains over strong baselines, providing a practical path toward verifiable-RL-driven LLM recommenders.

      With the widespread use of large language models (LLMs), many researchers have turned their attention to detecting text generated by them. However, there is no consistent or precise definition of their target, namely "LLM-generated text". Differences in usage scenarios and the diversity of LLMs further increase the difficulty of detection. What is commonly regarded as the detecting target usually represents only a subset of the text that LLMs can potentially produce. Human edits to LLM outputs, together with the subtle influences that LLMs exert on their users, are blurring the line between LLM-generated and human-written text. Existing benchmarks and evaluation approaches do not adequately address the various conditions in real-world detector applications. Hence, the numerical results of detectors are often misunderstood, and their significance is diminishing. Therefore, detectors remain useful under specific conditions, but their results should be interpreted only as references rather than decisive indicators.

      Recently, Sharma et al. suggested a method called Layer-SElective-Rank reduction (LASER) which demonstrated that pruning high-order components of carefully chosen LLM's weight matrices can boost downstream accuracy -- without any gradient-based fine-tuning. Yet LASER's exhaustive, per-matrix search (each requiring full-dataset forward passes) makes it impractical for rapid deployment. We demonstrate that this overhead can be removed and find that: (i) Only a small, carefully chosen subset of matrices needs to be inspected -- eliminating the layer-by-layer sweep, (ii) The gradient of each matrix's singular values pinpoints which matrices merit reduction, (iii) Increasing the factorization search space by allowing matrices rows to cluster around multiple subspaces and then decomposing each cluster separately further reduces overfitting on the original training data and further lifts accuracy by up to 24.6 percentage points, and finally, (iv) we discover that evaluating on just 100 samples rather than the full training data -- both for computing the indicative gradients and for measuring the final accuracy -- suffices to further reduce the search time; we explain that as adaptation to downstream tasks is dominated by prompting style, not dataset size. As a result, we show that combining these findings yields a fast and robust adaptation algorithm for downstream tasks. Overall, with a single gradient step on 100 examples and a quick scan of the top candidate layers and factorization techniques, we can adapt LLMs to new datasets -- entirely without fine-tuning.

      Current methods for evaluating large language models (LLMs) typically focus on high-level tasks such as text generation, without targeting a particular AI application. This approach is not sufficient for evaluating LLMs for Responsible AI dimensions like fairness, since protected attributes that are highly relevant in one application may be less relevant in another. In this work, we construct a dataset that is driven by a real-world application (generate a plain-text product description, given a list of product features), parameterized by fairness attributes intersected with gendered adjectives and product categories, yielding a rich set of labeled prompts. We show how to use the data to identify quality, veracity, safety, and fairness gaps in LLMs, contributing a proposal for LLM evaluation paired with a concrete resource for the research community.

      Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the dominant architectural pattern to operationalize Large Language Model (LLM) usage in Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) systems. However, this design is susceptible to poisoning attacks, and previously proposed defenses can fail for CTI contexts as cyber threat information is often completely new for emerging attacks, and sophisticated threat actors can mimic legitimate formats, terminology, and stylistic conventions. To address this issue, we propose that the robustness of modern RAG defenses can be accelerated by applying source credibility algorithms on corpora, using PageRank as an example. In our experiments, we demonstrate quantitatively that our algorithm applies a lower authority score to malicious documents while promoting trusted content, using the standardized MS MARCO dataset. We also demonstrate proof-of-concept performance of our algorithm on CTI documents and feeds.

      We present Empathic Prompting, a novel framework for multimodal human-AI interaction that enriches Large Language Model (LLM) conversations with implicit non-verbal context. The system integrates a commercial facial expression recognition service to capture users' emotional cues and embeds them as contextual signals during prompting. Unlike traditional multimodal interfaces, empathic prompting requires no explicit user control; instead, it unobtrusively augments textual input with affective information for conversational and smoothness alignment. The architecture is modular and scalable, allowing integration of additional non-verbal modules. We describe the system design, implemented through a locally deployed DeepSeek instance, and report a preliminary service and usability evaluation (N=5). Results show consistent integration of non-verbal input into coherent LLM outputs, with participants highlighting conversational fluidity. Beyond this proof of concept, empathic prompting points to applications in chatbot-mediated communication, particularly in domains like healthcare or education, where users' emotional signals are critical yet often opaque in verbal exchanges.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Large language models (LLMs) have seen rapid adoption for tasks such as drafting emails, summarizing meetings, and answering health questions. In such uses, users may need to share private information (e.g., health records, contact details). To evaluate LLMs' ability to identify and redact such private information, prior work developed benchmarks (e.g., ConfAIde, PrivacyLens) with real-life scenarios. Using these benchmarks, researchers have found that LLMs sometimes fail to keep secrets private when responding to complex tasks (e.g., leaking employee salaries in meeting summaries). However, these evaluations rely on LLMs (proxy LLMs) to gauge compliance with privacy norms, overlooking real users' perceptions. Moreover, prior work primarily focused on the privacy-preservation quality of responses, without investigating nuanced differences in helpfulness. To understand how users perceive the privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of LLM responses to privacy-sensitive scenarios, we conducted a user study with 94 participants using 90 scenarios from PrivacyLens. We found that, when evaluating identical responses to the same scenario, users showed low agreement with each other on the privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of the LLM response. Further, we found high agreement among five proxy LLMs, while each individual LLM had low correlation with users' evaluations. These results indicate that the privacy and helpfulness of LLM responses are often specific to individuals, and proxy LLMs are poor estimates of how real users would perceive these responses in privacy-sensitive scenarios. Our results suggest the need to conduct user-centered studies on measuring LLMs' ability to help users while preserving privacy. Additionally, future research could investigate ways to improve the alignment between proxy LLMs and users for better estimation of users' perceived privacy and utility.

      Tabular prediction has traditionally relied on gradient-boosted decision trees and specialized deep learning models, which excel within tasks but provide limited interpretability and weak transfer across tables. Reasoning large language models (LLMs) promise cross-task adaptability with trans- parent reasoning traces, yet their potential has not been fully realized for tabular data. This paper presents TabR1, the first reasoning LLM for tabular prediction with multi-step reasoning. At its core is Permutation Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO), a simple yet efficient reinforcement learning method that encodes column-permutation invariance as a structural prior. By construct- ing multiple label-preserving permutations per sample and estimating advantages both within and across permutations, PRPO transforms sparse rewards into dense learning signals and improves generalization. With limited supervision, PRPO activates the reasoning ability of LLMs for tabular prediction, enhancing few-shot and zero-shot performance as well as interpretability. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TabR1 achieves performance comparable to strong baselines under full-supervision fine-tuning. In the zero-shot setting, TabR1 approaches the performance of strong baselines under the 32-shot setting. Moreover, TabR1 (8B) substantially outperforms much larger LLMs across various tasks, achieving up to 53.17% improvement over DeepSeek-R1 (685B).

      DeepSeek-R1 has successfully enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning capabilities through its rule-based reward system. While it's a ''perfect'' reward system that effectively mitigates reward hacking, such reward functions are often discrete. Our experimental observations suggest that discrete rewards can lead to gradient anomaly, unstable optimization, and slow convergence. To address this issue, we propose ReDit (Reward Dithering), a method that dithers the discrete reward signal by adding simple random noise. With this perturbed reward, exploratory gradients are continuously provided throughout the learning process, enabling smoother gradient updates and accelerating convergence. The injected noise also introduces stochasticity into flat reward regions, encouraging the model to explore novel policies and escape local optima. Experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of ReDit. On average, ReDit achieves performance comparable to vanilla GRPO with only approximately 10% the training steps, and furthermore, still exhibits a 4% performance improvement over vanilla GRPO when trained for a similar duration. Visualizations confirm significant mitigation of gradient issues with ReDit. Moreover, theoretical analyses are provided to further validate these advantages.

      Recent studies show that LLMs possess different skills and specialize in different tasks. In fact, we observe that their varied performance occur in several levels of granularity. For example, in the code optimization task, code LLMs excel at different optimization categories and no one dominates others. This observation prompts the question of how one leverages multiple LLM agents to solve a coding problem without knowing their complementary strengths a priori. We argue that a team of agents can learn from each other's successes and failures so as to improve their own performance. Thus, a lesson is the knowledge produced by an agent and passed on to other agents in the collective solution process. We propose a lesson-based collaboration framework, design the lesson solicitation--banking--selection mechanism, and demonstrate that a team of small LLMs with lessons learned can outperform a much larger LLM and other multi-LLM collaboration methods.

      As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to evolve, practitioners face increasing options for enhancing inference-time performance without model retraining, including budget tuning and multi-step techniques like self-reflection. While these methods improve output quality, they create complex trade-offs among accuracy, cost, and latency that remain poorly understood across different domains. This paper systematically compares self-reflection and budget tuning across mathematical reasoning and translation tasks. We evaluate prominent LLMs, including Anthropic Claude, Amazon Nova, and Mistral families, along with other models under varying reflection depths and compute budgets to derive Pareto optimal performance frontiers. Our analysis reveals substantial domain dependent variation in self-reflection effectiveness, with performance gains up to 220\% in mathematical reasoning. We further investigate how reflection round depth and feedback mechanism quality influence performance across model families. To validate our findings in a real-world setting, we deploy a self-reflection enhanced marketing content localisation system at Lounge by Zalando, where it shows market-dependent effectiveness, reinforcing the importance of domain specific evaluation when deploying these techniques. Our results provide actionable guidance for selecting optimal inference strategies given specific domains and resource constraints.

      Recent work has demonstrated state-of-the-art results in large language model (LLM) hallucination detection and mitigation through consistency-based approaches which involve aggregating multiple responses sampled from a single LLM for a given prompt. These approaches help offset limitations stemming from the imperfect data on which LLMs are trained, which includes biases and under-representation of information required at deployment time among other limitations which can lead to hallucinations. We show that extending these single-model consistency methods to combine responses from multiple LLMs with different training data, training schemes and model architectures can result in substantial further improvements in hallucination detection and mitigation capabilities beyond their single-model consistency counterparts. We evaluate this "consortium consistency" approach across many model teams from a pool of 15 LLMs and explore under what conditions it is beneficial to team together different LLMs in this manner. Further, we show that these performance improvements often come with reduced inference costs, offsetting a significant drawback with single-model consistency methods.

      Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently demonstrated notable success in enhancing the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), particularly on mathematics and programming tasks. Similar to how traditional RL helps agents explore and learn new strategies, RLVR is believed to enable LLMs to continuously self-improve, thus acquiring novel reasoning abilities beyond those of the corresponding base models. In this study we critically examine the current state of RLVR by systematically probing the reasoning capability boundaries of RLVR-trained LLMs across various model families, RL algorithms, and math, coding, and visual reasoning benchmarks, using pass@k at large k values as the evaluation metric. Surprisingly, we find that the current training setup does not elicit fundamentally new reasoning patterns. While RLVR-trained models outperform their base models at small k (e.g., k = 1), the base models achieve a higher pass@k score when k is large. Coverage and perplexity analyses show that the observed reasoning abilities originate from and are bounded by the base model. Treating the base model as an upper bound, our quantitative analysis shows that six popular RLVR algorithms perform similarly and remain far from optimal in leveraging the potential of the base model. By contrast, we find that distillation can introduce new reasoning patterns from the teacher and genuinely expand the model's reasoning capabilities. Overall, our findings suggest that current RLVR methods have not yet realized the potential of RL to elicit truly novel reasoning abilities in LLMs. This highlights the need for improved RL paradigms, such as continual scaling and multi-turn agent-environment interaction, to unlock this potential.

      Large Language Models are increasingly adopted as critical tools for accelerating innovation. This paper identifies and formalizes a systemic risk inherent in this paradigm: \textbf{Black Box Absorption}. We define this as the process by which the opaque internal architectures of LLM platforms, often operated by large-scale service providers, can internalize, generalize, and repurpose novel concepts contributed by users during interaction. This mechanism threatens to undermine the foundational principles of innovation economics by creating severe informational and structural asymmetries between individual creators and platform operators, thereby jeopardizing the long-term sustainability of the innovation ecosystem. To analyze this challenge, we introduce two core concepts: the idea unit, representing the transportable functional logic of an innovation, and idea safety, a multidimensional standard for its protection. This paper analyzes the mechanisms of absorption and proposes a concrete governance and engineering agenda to mitigate these risks, ensuring that creator contributions remain traceable, controllable, and equitable.

      Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on final-answer correctness is the dominant paradigm. This approach, however, provides a coarse signal for model improvement and overlooks the quality of the underlying reasoning process. We argue that a more granular evaluation of reasoning offers a more effective path to building robust models. We decompose reasoning quality into two dimensions: relevance and coherence. Relevance measures if a step is grounded in the problem; coherence measures if it follows logically from prior steps. To measure these aspects reliably, we introduce causal stepwise evaluation (CaSE). This method assesses each reasoning step using only its preceding context, which avoids hindsight bias. We validate CaSE against human judgments on our new expert-annotated benchmarks, MRa-GSM8K and MRa-MATH. More importantly, we show that curating training data with CaSE-evaluated relevance and coherence directly improves final task performance. Our work provides a scalable framework for analyzing, debugging, and improving LLM reasoning, demonstrating the practical value of moving beyond validity checks.

      Large language models (LLMs) are now ubiquitous in user-facing applications, yet they still generate undesirable toxic outputs, including profanity, vulgarity, and derogatory remarks. Although numerous detoxification methods exist, most apply broad, surface-level fixes and can therefore easily be circumvented by jailbreak attacks. In this paper we leverage sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to identify toxicity-related directions in the residual stream of models and perform targeted activation steering using the corresponding decoder vectors. We introduce three tiers of steering aggressiveness and evaluate them on GPT-2 Small and Gemma-2-2B, revealing trade-offs between toxicity reduction and language fluency. At stronger steering strengths, these causal interventions surpass competitive baselines in reducing toxicity by up to 20%, though fluency can degrade noticeably on GPT-2 Small depending on the aggressiveness. Crucially, standard NLP benchmark scores upon steering remain stable, indicating that the model's knowledge and general abilities are preserved. We further show that feature-splitting in wider SAEs hampers safety interventions, underscoring the importance of disentangled feature learning. Our findings highlight both the promise and the current limitations of SAE-based causal interventions for LLM detoxification, further suggesting practical guidelines for safer language-model deployment.

      Recent advances such as self-consistency and test-time reinforcement learning (TTRL) improve the reliability of large language models (LLMs) without additional supervision, yet their underlying mechanisms and statistical guarantees remain poorly understood. We present a unified framework for certifiable inference in LLMs, showing that majority voting provides a statistical certificate of self-consistency: under mild assumptions, the aggregated answer coincides with the mode of the model's terminal distribution with high probability. We derive finite-sample and anytime-valid concentration bounds that quantify this confidence, and introduce the Martingale Majority Certificate (MMC), a sequential stopping rule that adaptively determines when sufficient samples have been drawn. We further prove that label-free post-training methods such as TTRL implicitly sharpen the answer distribution by exponentially tilting it toward its mode, thereby reducing the number of samples required for certification. Building on this insight, we propose new post-training objectives that explicitly optimise this trade-off between sharpness and bias. Together, these results explain and connect two central test-time scaling strategies, self-consistency and TTRL, within a single statistical framework for label-free, certifiable reliability in reasoning LLMs.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have inherent limitations of faithfulness and factuality, commonly referred to as hallucinations. Several benchmarks have been developed that provide a test bed for factuality evaluation within the context of English-centric datasets, while relying on supplementary informative context like web links or text passages but ignoring the available structured factual resources. To this end, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have been identified as a useful aid for hallucination mitigation, as they provide a structured way to represent the facts about entities and their relations with minimal linguistic overhead. We bridge the lack of KG paths and multilinguality for factual language modeling within the existing hallucination evaluation benchmarks and propose a KG-based multilingual, multihop benchmark called MultiHal framed for generative text evaluation. As part of our data collection pipeline, we mined 140k KG-paths from open-domain KGs, from which we pruned noisy KG-paths, curating a high-quality subset of 25.9k. Our baseline evaluation shows an absolute scale improvement by approximately 0.12 to 0.36 points for the semantic similarity score, 0.16 to 0.36 for NLI entailment and 0.29 to 0.42 for hallucination detection in KG-RAG over vanilla QA across multiple languages and multiple models, demonstrating the potential of KG integration. We anticipate MultiHal will foster future research towards several graph-based hallucination mitigation and fact-checking tasks.

Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that Zhyper achieves competitive performance with up to 26x fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art baselines.

      Reward model (RM) plays a pivotal role in reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, classical RMs trained on human preferences are vulnerable to reward hacking and generalize poorly to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. By contrast, strong LLM judges equipped with reasoning capabilities demonstrate superior generalization, even without additional training, but incur significantly higher inference costs, limiting their applicability in online RLHF. In this work, we propose an uncertainty-based routing framework that efficiently complements a fast RM with a strong but costly LLM judge. Our approach formulates advantage estimation in policy gradient (PG) methods as pairwise preference classification, enabling principled uncertainty quantification to guide routing. Uncertain pairs are forwarded to the LLM judge, while confident ones are evaluated by the RM. Experiments on RM benchmarks demonstrate that our uncertainty-based routing strategy significantly outperforms random judge calling at the same cost, and downstream alignment results showcase its effectiveness in improving online RLHF.

      Post-training of large language models is essential for adapting pre-trained language models (PLMs) to align with human preferences and downstream tasks. While PLMs typically exhibit well-calibrated confidence, post-trained language models (PoLMs) often suffer from over-confidence, assigning high confidence to both correct and incorrect outputs, which can undermine reliability in critical applications. A major obstacle in calibrating PoLMs is the scarcity of labeled data for individual downstream tasks. To address this, we propose Disagreement-Aware Confidence Alignment (DACA), a novel unsupervised method to optimize the parameters (e.g., temperature $\tau$) in post-hoc confidence calibration. Our method is motivated by the under-confidence issue caused by prediction disagreement between the PLM and PoLM while aligning their confidence via temperature scaling. Theoretically, the PLM's confidence underestimates PoLM's prediction accuracy on disagreement examples, causing a larger $\tau$ and producing under-confident predictions. DACA mitigates this by selectively using only agreement examples for calibration, effectively decoupling the influence of disagreement. In this manner, our method avoids an overly large $\tau$ in temperature scaling caused by disagreement examples, improving calibration performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, improving the average ECE of open-sourced and API-based LLMs (e.g. GPT-4o) by up to 15.08$\%$ on common benchmarks.

      As large language models (LLMs) transition from static tools to fully agentic systems, their potential for transforming social science research has become increasingly evident. This paper introduces a structured framework for understanding the diverse applications of LLM-based agents, ranging from simple data processors to complex, multi-agent systems capable of simulating emergent social dynamics. By mapping this developmental continuum across six levels, the paper clarifies the technical and methodological boundaries between different agentic architectures, providing a comprehensive overview of current capabilities and future potential. It highlights how lower-tier systems streamline conventional tasks like text classification and data annotation, while higher-tier systems enable novel forms of inquiry, including the study of group dynamics, norm formation, and large-scale social processes. However, these advancements also introduce significant challenges, including issues of reproducibility, ethical oversight, and the risk of emergent biases. The paper critically examines these concerns, emphasizing the need for robust validation protocols, interdisciplinary collaboration, and standardized evaluation metrics. It argues that while LLM-based agents hold transformative potential for the social sciences, realizing this promise will require careful, context-sensitive deployment and ongoing methodological refinement. The paper concludes with a call for future research that balances technical innovation with ethical responsibility, encouraging the development of agentic systems that not only replicate but also extend the frontiers of social science, offering new insights into the complexities of human behavior.

      Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have long served as a fundamental infrastructure for structured knowledge representation and reasoning. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), the construction of KGs has entered a new paradigm-shifting from rule-based and statistical pipelines to language-driven and generative frameworks. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of recent progress in LLM-empowered knowledge graph construction, systematically analyzing how LLMs reshape the classical three-layered pipeline of ontology engineering, knowledge extraction, and knowledge fusion. We first revisit traditional KG methodologies to establish conceptual foundations, and then review emerging LLM-driven approaches from two complementary perspectives: schema-based paradigms, which emphasize structure, normalization, and consistency; and schema-free paradigms, which highlight flexibility, adaptability, and open discovery. Across each stage, we synthesize representative frameworks, analyze their technical mechanisms, and identify their limitations. Finally, the survey outlines key trends and future research directions, including KG-based reasoning for LLMs, dynamic knowledge memory for agentic systems, and multimodal KG construction. Through this systematic review, we aim to clarify the evolving interplay between LLMs and knowledge graphs, bridging symbolic knowledge engineering and neural semantic understanding toward the development of adaptive, explainable, and intelligent knowledge systems.

      Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to recognize novel concepts from only a few labeled support samples. Recent studies enhance support features by incorporating additional semantic information or designing complex semantic fusion modules. However, they still suffer from hallucinating semantics that contradict the visual evidence due to the lack of grounding in actual instances, resulting in noisy guidance and costly corrections. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework, bridging Vision and Text with LLMs for Few-Shot Learning (VT-FSL), which constructs precise cross-modal prompts conditioned on Large Language Models (LLMs) and support images, seamlessly integrating them through a geometry-aware alignment. It mainly consists of Cross-modal Iterative Prompting (CIP) and Cross-modal Geometric Alignment (CGA). Specifically, the CIP conditions an LLM on both class names and support images to generate precise class descriptions iteratively in a single structured reasoning pass. These descriptions not only enrich the semantic understanding of novel classes but also enable the zero-shot synthesis of semantically consistent images. The descriptions and synthetic images act respectively as complementary textual and visual prompts, providing high-level class semantics and low-level intra-class diversity to compensate for limited support data. Furthermore, the CGA jointly aligns the fused textual, support, and synthetic visual representations by minimizing the kernelized volume of the 3-dimensional parallelotope they span. It captures global and nonlinear relationships among all representations, enabling structured and consistent multimodal integration. The proposed VT-FSL method establishes new state-of-the-art performance across ten diverse benchmarks, including standard, cross-domain, and fine-grained few-shot learning scenarios.

      As large language models (LLMs) advance, the ultimate vision for their role in science is emerging: we could build an AI collaborator to effectively assist human beings throughout the entire scientific research process. We refer to this envisioned system as ResearchGPT. Given that scientific research progresses through multiple interdependent phases, achieving this vision requires rigorous benchmarks that evaluate the end-to-end workflow rather than isolated sub-tasks. To this end, we contribute CS-54k, a high-quality corpus of scientific Q&A pairs in computer science, built from 14k CC-licensed papers. It is constructed through a scalable, paper-grounded pipeline that combines retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with multi-stage quality control to ensure factual grounding. From this unified corpus, we derive two complementary subsets: CS-4k, a carefully curated benchmark for evaluating AI's ability to assist scientific research, and CS-50k, a large-scale training dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CS-4k stratifies state-of-the-art LLMs into distinct capability tiers. Open models trained on CS-50k with supervised training and reinforcement learning demonstrate substantial improvements. Even 7B-scale models, when properly trained, outperform many larger proprietary systems, such as GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. This indicates that making AI models better research assistants relies more on domain-aligned training with high-quality data than on pretraining scale or general benchmark performance. We release CS-4k and CS-50k in the hope of fostering AI systems as reliable collaborators in CS research.

      While chain-of-thought prompting with Best-of-N (BoN) selection has become popular for mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs), its linear structure fails to capture the branching and exploratory nature of complex problem-solving. In this work, we propose an adaptive algorithm to maximize process reward model (PRM) scores over the intractable action space, and investigate whether PRM-guided tree search can improve mathematical reasoning by exploring multiple partial solution paths. Across $23$ diverse mathematical problems using Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct with its associated PRM as a case study, we find that: (1) PRM-guided tree search shows no statistically significant improvements over BoN despite higher costs, (2) Monte Carlo tree search and beam search outperform other PRM-guided tree search methods, (3) PRMs poorly approximate state values and their reliability degrades with reasoning depth, and (4) PRMs generalize poorly out of distribution. This underperformance stems from tree search's greater reliance on unreliable PRM scores, suggesting different reward modeling is necessary before tree search can effectively enhance mathematical reasoning in LLMs.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      The tendency to find and exploit "shortcuts" to complete tasks poses significant risks for reliable assessment and deployment of large language models (LLMs). For example, an LLM agent with access to unit tests may delete failing tests rather than fix the underlying bug. Such behavior undermines both the validity of benchmark results and the reliability of real-world LLM coding assistant deployments. To quantify, study, and mitigate such behavior, we introduce ImpossibleBench, a benchmark framework that systematically measures LLM agents' propensity to exploit test cases. ImpossibleBench creates "impossible" variants of tasks from existing benchmarks like LiveCodeBench and SWE-bench by introducing direct conflicts between the natural-language specification and the unit tests. We measure an agent's "cheating rate" as its pass rate on these impossible tasks, where any pass necessarily implies a specification-violating shortcut. As a practical framework, ImpossibleBench is not just an evaluation but a versatile tool. We demonstrate its utility for: (1) studying model behaviors, revealing more fine-grained details of cheating behaviors from simple test modification to complex operator overloading; (2) context engineering, showing how prompt, test access and feedback loop affect cheating rates; and (3) developing monitoring tools, providing a testbed with verified deceptive solutions. We hope ImpossibleBench serves as a useful framework for building more robust and reliable LLM systems. Our implementation can be found at https://github.com/safety-research/impossiblebench.

We systematically evaluate prompting strategies for six multilingual LLMs (0.5B-9B parameters) on the MedEV dataset, comparing zero-shot, few-shot, and dictionary-augmented prompting with Meddict, an English-Vietnamese medical lexicon. Results show that model scale is the primary driver of performance: larger LLMs achieve strong zero-shot results, while few-shot prompting yields only marginal improvements. In contrast, terminology-aware cues and embedding-based example retrieval consistently improve domain-specific translation. These findings underscore both the promise and the current limitations of multilingual LLMs for medical En-Vi MT.

      Hidden LLM prompts have appeared in online documents with increasing frequency. Their goal is to trigger indirect prompt injection attacks while remaining undetected from human oversight, to manipulate LLM-powered automated document processing systems, against applications as diverse as r\'esum\'e screeners through to academic peer review processes. Detecting hidden LLM prompts is therefore important for ensuring trust in AI-assisted human decision making. This paper presents the first principled approach to hidden LLM prompt detection in structured documents. We implement our approach in a prototype tool called PhantomLint. We evaluate PhantomLint against a corpus of 3,402 documents, including both PDF and HTML documents, and covering academic paper preprints, CVs, theses and more. We find that our approach is generally applicable against a wide range of methods for hiding LLM prompts from visual inspection, has a very low false positive rate (approx. 0.092%), is practically useful for detecting hidden LLM prompts in real documents, while achieving acceptable performance.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) empower recommendation systems through their advanced reasoning and planning capabilities. However, the dynamic nature of user interests and content poses a significant challenge: While initial fine-tuning aligns LLMs with domain knowledge and user preferences, it fails to capture such real-time changes, necessitating robust update mechanisms. This paper investigates strategies for updating LLM-powered recommenders, focusing on the trade-offs between ongoing fine-tuning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Using an LLM-powered user interest exploration system as a case study, we perform a comparative analysis of these methods across dimensions like cost, agility, and knowledge incorporation. We propose a hybrid update strategy that leverages the long-term knowledge adaptation of periodic fine-tuning with the agility of low-cost RAG. We demonstrate through live A/B experiments on a billion-user platform that this hybrid approach yields statistically significant improvements in user satisfaction, offering a practical and cost-effective framework for maintaining high-quality LLM-powered recommender systems.

      The evolution of cooperation has been extensively studied using abstract mathematical models and simulations. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and the rise of LLM agents have demonstrated their ability to perform social reasoning, thus providing an opportunity to test the emergence of norms in more realistic agent-based simulations with human-like reasoning using natural language. In this research, we investigate whether the cooperation dynamics presented in Boyd and Richerson's model persist in a more realistic simulation of the Diner's Dilemma using LLM agents compared to the abstract mathematical nature in the work of Boyd and Richerson. Our findings indicate that agents follow the strategies defined in the Boyd and Richerson model, and explicit punishment mechanisms drive norm emergence, reinforcing cooperative behaviour even when the agent strategy configuration varies. Our results suggest that LLM-based Multi-Agent System simulations, in fact, can replicate the evolution of cooperation predicted by the traditional mathematical models. Moreover, our simulations extend beyond the mathematical models by integrating natural language-driven reasoning and a pairwise imitation method for strategy adoption, making them a more realistic testbed for cooperative behaviour in MASs.

      The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into software engineering has driven a transition from traditional rule-based systems to autonomous agentic systems capable of solving complex problems. However, systematic progress is hindered by a lack of comprehensive understanding of how benchmarks and solutions interconnect. This survey addresses this gap by providing the first holistic analysis of LLM-powered software engineering, offering insights into evaluation methodologies and solution paradigms. We review over 150 recent papers and propose a taxonomy along two key dimensions: (1) Solutions, categorized into prompt-based, fine-tuning-based, and agent-based paradigms, and (2) Benchmarks, including tasks such as code generation, translation, and repair. Our analysis highlights the evolution from simple prompt engineering to sophisticated agentic systems incorporating capabilities like planning, reasoning, memory mechanisms, and tool augmentation. To contextualize this progress, we present a unified pipeline illustrating the workflow from task specification to deliverables, detailing how different solution paradigms address various complexity levels. Unlike prior surveys that focus narrowly on specific aspects, this work connects 50+ benchmarks to their corresponding solution strategies, enabling researchers to identify optimal approaches for diverse evaluation criteria. We also identify critical research gaps and propose future directions, including multi-agent collaboration, self-evolving systems, and formal verification integration.

      Modern language models operate on subword-tokenized text in order to make a trade-off between model size, inference speed, and vocabulary coverage. A side effect of this is that, during inference, models are evaluated by measuring the probability of only the specific tokenization produced as the output, despite there being many possible ways to represent the same text with a subword vocabulary. Recent studies have argued instead for evaluating LLMs by marginalization - the probability mass of all tokenizations of a given text. Marginalization is difficult due to the number of possible tokenizations of a text, so often approximate marginalization is done via sampling. However, a downside of sampling is that an expensive generation step must be performed by the LLM for each sample, which limits the number of samples that can be acquired given a runtime budget, and therefore also the accuracy of the approximation. Since computing the probability of a sequence given the tokenization is relatively cheap compared to actually generating it, we investigate sampling strategies that are decoding-free - they require no generation from the LLM, instead relying entirely on extremely cheap sampling strategies that are model and tokenizer agnostic. We investigate the approximation quality and speed of decoding-free sampling strategies for a number of open models to find that they provide sufficiently accurate marginal estimates at a small fraction of the runtime cost and demonstrate its use on a set of downstream inference tasks.

      The ability to recognize patterns from examples and apply them to new ones is a primal ability for general intelligence, and is widely studied by psychology and AI researchers. Many benchmarks have been proposed to measure such ability for Large Language Models (LLMs); however, they focus on few-shot (usually <10) setting and lack evaluation for aggregating many pieces of information from long contexts. On the other hand, the ever-growing context length of LLMs have brought forth the novel paradigm of many-shot In-Context Learning (ICL), which addresses new tasks with hundreds to thousands of examples without expensive and inefficient fine-tuning. However, many-shot evaluations often focus on classification, and popular long-context LLM tasks such as Needle-In-A-Haystack (NIAH) seldom require complicated intelligence for integrating many pieces of information. To fix the issues from both worlds, we propose MIR-Bench, the first many-shot in-context reasoning benchmark for pattern recognition that asks LLM to predict output via input-output examples from underlying functions with diverse data format. Based on MIR-Bench, we study many novel problems for many-shot in-context reasoning, and acquired many insightful findings including scaling effect, robustness, inductive vs. transductive reasoning, retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), coding for inductive reasoning, cross-domain generalizability, etc.

      This paper investigates Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM) agents in long-horizon, multi-turn scenarios. Although RL algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) have been widely applied to train multi-turn LLM agents, they typically rely only on sparse outcome rewards and lack dense intermediate signals across multiple decision steps, limiting their performance on complex reasoning tasks. To bridge this gap, we present the first systematic study of \textit{turn-level reward design} for multi-turn RL algorithms and agent applications. By integrating turn-level rewards, we extend GRPO and PPO to their respective multi-turn variants, enabling fine-grained credit assignment. We conduct case studies on multi-turn reasoning-augmented search agents, where we carefully design two types of turn-level rewards: verifiable and LLM-as-judge. Our experiments on multi-turn search tasks demonstrate that incorporating well-designed turn-level rewards enables RL algorithms to significantly outperform baseline methods with trajectory-level rewards. Both training and validation reward curves illustrate that our method achieves \textit{greater stability}, \textit{faster convergence}, and \textit{higher accuracy}. Numerical results across diverse question-answering datasets further show that our approach consistently delivers highest answer correctness and 100\% format correctness.

      Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a compelling way to strengthen the multi step reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, prevalent RL paradigms still lean on sparse outcome-based rewards and limited exploration, which often drives LLMs toward repetitive and suboptimal reasoning patterns. In this paper, we study the central question of how to design exploration for LLM reasoning and introduce MERCI (Motivating Exploration in LLM Reasoning with Count-based Intrinsic Rewards), a novel RL algorithm that augments policy optimization with a principled intrinsic reward. Building on the idea of count-based exploration, MERCI leverages a lightweight Coin Flipping Network (CFN) to estimate the pseudo count and further epistemic uncertainty over reasoning trajectories, and converts them into an intrinsic reward that values novelty while preserving the learning signal from task rewards. We integrate MERCI into some advanced RL frameworks like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments on complex reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MERCI encourages richer and more varied chains of thought, significantly improves performance over strong baselines, and helps the policy escape local routines to discover better solutions. It indicates that our targeted intrinsic motivation can make exploration reliable for language model reasoning.

Existing data selection methods aim to curate smaller, high-quality subsets but often rely on costly external models or opaque heuristics. In this work, we shift the focus from external heuristics to the model's internal mechanisms. We find that complex reasoning tasks consistently activate a sparse, specialized subset of attention heads, forming core reasoning circuits. Building on this insight, we propose CircuitSeer, a novel data selection method that quantifies the reasoning complexity of data by measuring its influence on these crucial circuits. Extensive experiments on 4 models and 9 datasets demonstrate CircuitSeer's superiority.

      Existing safety evaluation methods for large language models (LLMs) suffer from inherent limitations, including evaluator bias and detection failures arising from model homogeneity, which collectively undermine the robustness of risk evaluation processes. This paper seeks to re-examine the risk evaluation paradigm by introducing a theoretical framework that reconstructs the underlying risk concept space. Specifically, we decompose the latent risk concept space into three mutually exclusive subspaces: the explicit risk subspace (encompassing direct violations of safety guidelines), the implicit risk subspace (capturing potential malicious content that requires contextual reasoning for identification), and the non-risk subspace. Furthermore, we propose RADAR, a multi-agent collaborative evaluation framework that leverages multi-round debate mechanisms through four specialized complementary roles and employs dynamic update mechanisms to achieve self-evolution of risk concept distributions. This approach enables comprehensive coverage of both explicit and implicit risks while mitigating evaluator bias. To validate the effectiveness of our framework, we construct an evaluation dataset comprising 800 challenging cases. Extensive experiments on our challenging testset and public benchmarks demonstrate that RADAR significantly outperforms baseline evaluation methods across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, stability, and self-evaluation risk sensitivity. Notably, RADAR achieves a 28.87% improvement in risk identification accuracy compared to the strongest baseline evaluation method.

The models are trained to improve the score of the original judge using its rationale and score. We present four quantitative judges for different types of absolute and relative feedback, which showcases the generality and versatility of our framework. Our framework is more computationally efficient than supervised fine-tuning and can be more statistically efficient when human feedback is limited, which is expected in practice. We validate these claims empirically on four datasets using two base judges. Our experiments show that quantitative judges can improve the predictive power of existing judges through post-hoc modeling.

      Technical debt refers to suboptimal code that degrades software quality. When developers intentionally introduce such debt, it is called self-admitted technical debt (SATD). Since SATD hinders maintenance, identifying its categories is key to uncovering quality issues. Traditionally, constructing such taxonomies requires manually inspecting SATD comments and surrounding code, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often inconsistent due to annotator subjectivity. In this study, we investigated to what extent large language models (LLMs) could generate SATD taxonomies. We designed a structured, LLM-driven pipeline that mirrors the taxonomy construction steps researchers typically follow. We evaluated it on SATD datasets from three domains: quantum software, smart contracts, and machine learning. It successfully recovered domain-specific categories reported in prior work, such as Layer Configuration in machine learning. It also completed taxonomy generation in under two hours and for less than $1, even on the largest dataset. These results suggest that, while full automation remains challenging, LLMs can support semi-automated SATD taxonomy construction. Furthermore, our work opens up avenues for future work, such as automated taxonomy generation in other areas.

      Large Language Models inherit stereotypes from their pretraining data, leading to biased behavior toward certain social groups in many Natural Language Processing tasks, such as hateful speech detection or sentiment analysis. Surprisingly, the evaluation of this kind of bias in stance detection methods has been largely overlooked by the community. Stance Detection involves labeling a statement as being against, in favor, or neutral towards a specific target and is among the most sensitive NLP tasks, as it often relates to political leanings. In this paper, we focus on the bias of Large Language Models when performing stance detection in a zero-shot setting. We automatically annotate posts in pre-existing stance detection datasets with two attributes: dialect or vernacular of a specific group and text complexity/readability, to investigate whether these attributes influence the model's stance detection decisions. Our results show that LLMs exhibit significant stereotypes in stance detection tasks, such as incorrectly associating pro-marijuana views with low text complexity and African American dialect with opposition to Donald Trump.

In Stage 1, we construct a behavioral-cloning dataset with a Remap-Reflect-Adjust pipeline, which produces high-quality, catalog-grounded demonstrations from powerful blackbox LLMs to warm-start the RL training. In Stage 2, we propose Rank-GRPO, a principled extension of group relative policy optimization (GRPO) tailored to tasks with rank-style outputs. Rank-GRPO treats each rank in the recommendation list as the unit instead of token (too fine-grained) or sequence (too coarse), redefining rewards to remove non-causal credit assignment and introducing a rank-level importance ratio based on the geometric mean of rank-wise token probabilities to stabilize policy updates. Experiments on the public Reddit-v2 dataset show that ConvRec-R1 converges faster and achieves higher Recall and NDCG than GRPO-style baselines.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Large language models (LLMs) have advanced the automation of data science workflows. Yet it remains unclear whether they can critically leverage external domain knowledge as human data scientists do in practice. To answer this question, we introduce AssistedDS (Assisted Data Science), a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate how LLMs handle domain knowledge in tabular prediction tasks. AssistedDS features both synthetic datasets with explicitly known generative mechanisms and real-world Kaggle competitions, each accompanied by curated bundles of helpful and adversarial documents. These documents provide domain-specific insights into data cleaning, feature engineering, and model selection. We assess state-of-the-art LLMs on their ability to discern and apply beneficial versus harmful domain knowledge, evaluating submission validity, information recall, and predictive performance. Our results demonstrate three key findings: (1) LLMs frequently exhibit an uncritical adoption of provided information, significantly impairing their predictive performance when adversarial content is introduced, (2) helpful guidance is often insufficient to counteract the negative influence of adversarial information, and (3) in Kaggle datasets, LLMs often make errors in handling time-series data, applying consistent feature engineering across different folds, and interpreting categorical variables correctly. These findings highlight a substantial gap in current models' ability to critically evaluate and leverage expert knowledge, underscoring an essential research direction for developing more robust, knowledge-aware automated data science systems.

      Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown outstanding potential for role-playing applications. Evaluating these capabilities is becoming crucial yet remains challenging. Existing benchmarks mostly adopt a \textbf{character-centric} approach, simplify user-character interactions to isolated Q&A tasks, and fail to reflect real-world applications. To address this limitation, we introduce RMTBench, a comprehensive \textbf{user-centric} bilingual role-playing benchmark featuring 80 diverse characters and over 8,000 dialogue rounds. RMTBench includes custom characters with detailed backgrounds and abstract characters defined by simple traits, enabling evaluation across various user scenarios. Our benchmark constructs dialogues based on explicit user motivations rather than character descriptions, ensuring alignment with practical user applications. Furthermore, we construct an authentic multi-turn dialogue simulation mechanism. With carefully selected evaluation dimensions and LLM-based scoring, this mechanism captures the complex intention of conversations between the user and the character. By shifting focus from character background to user intention fulfillment, RMTBench bridges the gap between academic evaluation and practical deployment requirements, offering a more effective framework for assessing role-playing capabilities in LLMs. All code and datasets will be released soon.

      Recent research has shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to automated jailbreak attacks, where adversarial suffixes crafted by algorithms appended to harmful queries bypass safety alignment and trigger unintended responses. Current methods for generating these suffixes are computationally expensive and have low Attack Success Rates (ASR), especially against well-aligned models like Llama2 and Llama3. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ADV-LLM, an iterative self-tuning process that crafts adversarial LLMs with enhanced jailbreak ability. Our framework significantly reduces the computational cost of generating adversarial suffixes while achieving nearly 100\% ASR on various open-source LLMs. Moreover, it exhibits strong attack transferability to closed-source models, achieving 99\% ASR on GPT-3.5 and 49\% ASR on GPT-4, despite being optimized solely on Llama3.

      In this paper, we investigate how personalising Large Language Models (Persona-LLMs) with annotator personas affects their sensitivity to hate speech, particularly regarding biases linked to shared or differing identities between annotators and targets. To this end, we employ Google's Gemini and OpenAI's GPT-4.1-mini models and two persona-prompting methods: shallow persona prompting and a deeply contextualised persona development based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to incorporate richer persona profiles. We analyse the impact of using in-group and out-group annotator personas on the models' detection performance and fairness across diverse social groups. This work bridges psychological insights on group identity with advanced NLP techniques, demonstrating that incorporating socio-demographic attributes into LLMs can address bias in automated hate speech detection.

      Automated regression test generation has been extensively explored, yet generating high-quality tests for Python programs remains particularly challenging. Because of the Python's dynamic typing features, existing approaches, ranging from search-based software testing (SBST) to recent LLM-driven techniques, are often prone to type errors. Hence, existing methods often generate invalid inputs and semantically inconsistent test cases, which ultimately undermine their practical effectiveness. To address these limitations, we present Test4Py, a novel framework that enhances type correctness in automated test generation for Python. Test4Py leverages the program's call graph to capture richer contextual information about parameters, and introduces a behavior-based type inference mechanism that accurately infers parameter types and construct valid test inputs. Beyond input construction, Test4Py integrates an iterative repair procedure that progressively refines generated test cases to improve coverage. In an evaluation on 183 real-world Python modules, Test4Py achieved an average statement coverage of 83.0% and branch coverage of 70.8%, outperforming state-of-the-art tools by 7.2% and 8.4%, respectively.

      The rapid evolution of smart cities has increased the reliance on intelligent interconnected services to optimize infrastructure, resources, and citizen well-being. Agentic AI has emerged as a key enabler by supporting autonomous decision-making and adaptive coordination, allowing urban systems to respond in real time to dynamic conditions. Its benefits are evident in areas such as transportation, where the integration of traffic data, weather forecasts, and safety sensors enables dynamic rerouting and a faster response to hazards. However, its deployment across heterogeneous smart city ecosystems raises critical governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) challenges, including accountability, data privacy, and regulatory alignment within decentralized infrastructures. Evaluation of SORA-ATMAS with three domain agents (Weather, Traffic, and Safety) demonstrated that its governance policies, including a fallback mechanism for high-risk scenarios, effectively steer multiple LLMs (GPT, Grok, DeepSeek) towards domain-optimized, policy-aligned outputs, producing an average MAE reduction of 35% across agents. Results showed stable weather monitoring, effective handling of high-risk traffic plateaus 0.85, and adaptive trust regulation in Safety/Fire scenarios 0.65. Runtime profiling of a 3-agent deployment confirmed scalability, with throughput between 13.8-17.2 requests per second, execution times below 72~ms, and governance delays under 100 ms, analytical projections suggest maintained performance at larger scales. Cross-domain rules ensured safe interoperability, with traffic rerouting permitted only under validated weather conditions. These findings validate SORA-ATMAS as a regulation-aligned, context-aware, and verifiable governance framework that consolidates distributed agent outputs into accountable, real-time decisions, offering a resilient foundation for smart-city management.

      Can large language model (LLM) agents reproduce the complex social dynamics that characterize human online behavior -- shaped by homophily, reciprocity, and social validation -- and what memory and learning mechanisms enable such dynamics to emerge? We present a multi-agent LLM simulation framework in which agents repeatedly interact, evaluate one another, and adapt their behavior through in-context learning accelerated by a coaching signal. To model human social behavior, we design behavioral reward functions that capture core drivers of online engagement, including social interaction, information seeking, self-presentation, coordination, and emotional support. These rewards align agent objectives with empirically observed user motivations, enabling the study of how network structures and group formations emerge from individual decision-making. Our experiments show that coached LLM agents develop stable interaction patterns and form emergent social ties, yielding network structures that mirror properties of real online communities. By combining behavioral rewards with in-context adaptation, our framework establishes a principled testbed for investigating collective dynamics in LLM populations and reveals how artificial agents may approximate or diverge from human-like social behavior.

      We study weight-only post-training quantization (PTQ), which quantizes the weights of a large language model (LLM) without retraining, using little or no calibration data. Weight-only PTQ is crucial for reducing the memory footprint and latency of LLM inference, especially in memory-bound, small-batch inference scenarios, such as personalized inference on edge devices. Despite its importance, irregular weight distributions with heavy-tailed outliers in LLMs complicate quantization, recently motivating rotation-based methods that transform weights into near-Gaussian distributions, which are more regular with fewer outliers, thereby reducing quantization error. In this work, we first derive the information-theoretically optimal bit allocation for Gaussianized weights under given bit budgets, revealing that fine-grained fractional-bit quantizers approaching the Gaussian distortion-rate bound are essential to achieve near-optimal quantization performance. To bridge this theoretical insight and practical implementation, we introduce Q-Palette, a versatile collection of fractional-bit quantizers that range from trellis-coded quantizers offering near-optimal distortion to simpler vector and scalar quantizers optimized for faster inference, all efficiently implemented with optimized CUDA kernels across various bitwidths. Furthermore, leveraging Q-Palette as a foundational component, we propose a novel mixed-scheme quantization framework, jointly optimizing quantizer choices and layer fusion decisions given resource constraints.

      Existing safety evaluation methods for large language models (LLMs) suffer from inherent limitations, including evaluator bias and detection failures arising from model homogeneity, which collectively undermine the robustness of risk evaluation processes. This paper seeks to re-examine the risk evaluation paradigm by introducing a theoretical framework that reconstructs the underlying risk concept space. Specifically, we decompose the latent risk concept space into three mutually exclusive subspaces: the explicit risk subspace (encompassing direct violations of safety guidelines), the implicit risk subspace (capturing potential malicious content that requires contextual reasoning for identification), and the non-risk subspace. Furthermore, we propose RADAR, a multi-agent collaborative evaluation framework that leverages multi-round debate mechanisms through four specialized complementary roles and employs dynamic update mechanisms to achieve self-evolution of risk concept distributions. This approach enables comprehensive coverage of both explicit and implicit risks while mitigating evaluator bias. To validate the effectiveness of our framework, we construct an evaluation dataset comprising 800 challenging cases. Extensive experiments on our challenging testset and public benchmarks demonstrate that RADAR significantly outperforms baseline evaluation methods across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, stability, and self-evaluation risk sensitivity. Notably, RADAR achieves a 28.87% improvement in risk identification accuracy compared to the strongest baseline evaluation method.

      With the goal of improving the security of Internet protocols, we seek faster, semi-automatic methods to discover new vulnerabilities in protocols such as DNS, BGP, and others. To this end, we introduce the LLM-Assisted Protocol Attack Discovery (LAPRAD) methodology, enabling security researchers with some DNS knowledge to efficiently uncover vulnerabilities that would otherwise be hard to detect. LAPRAD follows a three-stage process. In the first, we consult an LLM (GPT-o1) that has been trained on a broad corpus of DNS-related sources and previous DDoS attacks to identify potential exploits. In the second stage, a different LLM automatically constructs the corresponding attack configurations using the ReACT approach implemented via LangChain (DNS zone file generation). Finally, in the third stage, we validate the attack's functionality and effectiveness. Using LAPRAD, we uncovered three new DDoS attacks on the DNS protocol and rediscovered two recently reported ones that were not included in the LLM's training data. The first new attack employs a bait-and-switch technique to trick resolvers into caching large, bogus DNSSEC RRSIGs, reducing their serving capacity to as little as 6%. The second exploits large DNSSEC encryption algorithms (RSA-4096) with multiple keys, thereby bypassing a recently implemented default RRSet limit. The third leverages ANY-type responses to produce a similar effect. These variations of a cache-flushing DDoS attack, called SigCacheFlush, circumvent existing patches, severely degrade resolver query capacity, and impact the latest versions of major DNS resolver implementations.

      Inference-time computation is a critical yet challenging paradigm for enhancing the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs). While existing strategies improve reasoning stability and consistency, they suffer from notable limitations: self-correction often reinforces the model's initial biases, and Multi-Agent Collaboration (MAC) often fails due to the lack of efficient coordination mechanisms, leading to collective errors. Although high-performing verifiers can detect reasoning errors, making them reliable requires substantial training. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel inference-time framework, Adaptive Coopetition (AdCo), in which LLM agents utilize an adaptive, UCB-based "coopetition" mechanism. At each round, agents leverage coarse verifier signals to determine whether to collaborate or compete, and iteratively refine their reasoning based on peer feedback. Without relying on high-performance verifiers, our adaptive strategy achieves significant performance gains on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, yielding a 20% relative improvement over baselines on the more challenging dataset. Our approach remains robust and consistent in terms of accuracy under different sample sizes and configurations. This adaptive, signal-guided "coopetition" framework enhances reasoning robustness by leveraging both model knowledge diversity and reasoning trace measures, while also promoting uncertainty-driven exploration, especially when participants have comparable capabilities. From this perspective, our work offers a fresh lens on inference-time computation and paves the way for more resilient multi-agent LLM systems.

      Modern model hubs, such as Hugging Face, store tens of petabytes of LLMs, with fine-tuned variants vastly outnumbering base models and dominating storage consumption. Existing storage reduction techniques -- such as deduplication and compression -- are either LLM-oblivious or not compatible with each other, limiting data reduction effectiveness. Our large-scale characterization study across all publicly available Hugging Face LLM repositories reveals several key insights: (1) fine-tuned models within the same family exhibit highly structured, sparse parameter differences suitable for delta compression; (2) bitwise similarity enables LLM family clustering; and (3) tensor-level deduplication is better aligned with model storage workloads, achieving high data reduction with low metadata overhead. Building on these insights, we design BitX, an effective, fast, lossless delta compression algorithm that compresses XORed difference between fine-tuned and base LLMs. We build ZipLLM, a model storage reduction pipeline that unifies tensor-level deduplication and lossless BitX compression. By synergizing deduplication and compression around LLM family clustering, ZipLLM reduces model storage consumption by 54%, over 20% higher than state-of-the-art deduplication and compression approaches.

      Reinforcement learning (RL) has become essential for unlocking advanced reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs). RL workflows involve interleaving rollout and training stages with fundamentally different resource requirements. Rollout typically dominates overall execution time, yet scales efficiently through multiple independent instances. In contrast, training requires tightly-coupled GPUs with full-mesh communication. Existing RL frameworks fall into two categories: co-located and disaggregated architectures. Co-located ones fail to address this resource tension by forcing both stages to share the same GPUs. Disaggregated architectures, without modifications of well-established RL algorithms, suffer from resource under-utilization. Meanwhile, preemptible GPU resources, i.e., spot instances on public clouds and spare capacity in production clusters, present significant cost-saving opportunities for accelerating RL workflows, if efficiently harvested for rollout. In this paper, we present RLBoost, a systematic solution for cost-efficient RL training that harvests preemptible GPU resources. Our key insight is that rollout's stateless and embarrassingly parallel nature aligns perfectly with preemptible and often fragmented resources. To efficiently utilize these resources despite frequent and unpredictable availability changes, RLBoost adopts a hybrid architecture with three key techniques: (1) adaptive rollout offload to dynamically adjust workloads on the reserved (on-demand) cluster, (2) pull-based weight transfer that quickly provisions newly available instances, and (3) token-level response collection and migration for efficient preemption handling and continuous load balancing. Extensive experiments show RLBoost increases training throughput by 1.51x-1.97x while improving cost efficiency by 28%-49% compared to using only on-demand GPU resources.

      The original CLIP text encoder is limited by a maximum input length of 77 tokens, which hampers its ability to effectively process long texts and perform fine-grained semantic understanding. In addition, the CLIP text encoder lacks support for multilingual inputs. All these limitations significantly restrict its applicability across a broader range of tasks. Recent studies have attempted to replace the CLIP text encoder with an LLM-based embedder to enhance its ability in processing long texts, multilingual understanding, and fine-grained semantic comprehension. However, because the representation spaces of LLMs and the vision-language space of CLIP are pretrained independently without alignment priors, direct alignment using contrastive learning can disrupt the intrinsic vision-language alignment in the CLIP image encoder, leading to an underutilization of the knowledge acquired during pre-training. To address this challenge, we propose ProCLIP, a curriculum learning-based progressive vision-language alignment framework to effectively align the CLIP image encoder with an LLM-based embedder. Specifically, ProCLIP first distills knowledge from CLIP's text encoder into the LLM-based embedder to leverage CLIP's rich pretrained knowledge while establishing initial alignment between the LLM embedder and CLIP image encoder. Subsequently, ProCLIP further aligns the CLIP image encoder with the LLM-based embedder through image-text contrastive tuning, employing self-distillation regularization to avoid overfitting. To achieve a more effective alignment, instance semantic alignment loss and embedding structure alignment loss are employed during representation inheritance and contrastive tuning.

      The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has created a diverse ecosystem of models with highly varying performance and costs, necessitating effective query routing to balance performance and expense. Current routing systems often rely on a centralized external router trained on a fixed set of LLMs, making them inflexible and prone to poor performance since the small router can not fully understand the knowledge boundaries of different LLMs. We introduce DiSRouter (Distributed Self-Router), a novel paradigm that shifts from centralized control to distributed routing. In DiSRouter, a query traverses a network of LLM agents, each independently deciding whether to answer or route to other agents based on its own self-awareness, its ability to judge its competence. This distributed design offers superior flexibility, scalability, and generalizability. To enable this, we propose a two-stage Self-Awareness Training pipeline that enhances each LLM's self-awareness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiSRouter significantly outperforms existing routing methods in utility across various scenarios, effectively distinguishes between easy and hard queries, and shows strong generalization to out-of-domain tasks. Our work validates that leveraging an LLM's intrinsic self-awareness is more effective than external assessment, paving the way for more modular and efficient multi-agent systems.

      Domain-adaptive post-training of large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising approach for specialized domains such as medicine and finance. However, significant challenges remain in identifying optimal adaptation criteria and training strategies across varying data and model configurations. To address these challenges, we introduce FINDAP, a systematic and fine-grained investigation into domain-adaptive post-training of LLMs for the finance domain. Our approach consists of four key components: FinCap, which defines the core capabilities required for the target domain; FinRec, an effective training recipe that jointly optimizes continual pre-training and instruction-following, along with a novel preference data distillation method leveraging process signals from a generative reward model; FinTrain, a curated set of training datasets supporting FinRec; and FinEval, a comprehensive evaluation suite aligned with FinCap. The resulting model, Llama-Fin, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of financial tasks. Our analysis also highlights how each post-training stage contributes to distinct capabilities, uncovering specific challenges and effective solutions, providing valuable insights for domain adaptation of LLMs

      Large Language Models (LLMs) routinely infer users demographic traits from phrasing alone, which can result in biased responses, even when no explicit demographic information is provided. The role of disability cues in shaping these inferences remains largely uncharted. Thus, we present the first systematic audit of disability-conditioned demographic bias across eight state-of-the-art instruction-tuned LLMs ranging from 3B to 72B parameters. Using a balanced template corpus that pairs nine disability categories with six real-world business domains, we prompt each model to predict five demographic attributes - gender, socioeconomic status, education, cultural background, and locality - under both neutral and disability-aware conditions. Across a varied set of prompts, models deliver a definitive demographic guess in up to 97\% of cases, exposing a strong tendency to make arbitrary inferences with no clear justification. Disability context heavily shifts predicted attribute distributions, and domain context can further amplify these deviations. We observe that larger models are simultaneously more sensitive to disability cues and more prone to biased reasoning, indicating that scale alone does not mitigate stereotype amplification. Our findings reveal persistent intersections between ableism and other demographic stereotypes, pinpointing critical blind spots in current alignment strategies. We release our evaluation framework and results to encourage disability-inclusive benchmarking and recommend integrating abstention calibration and counterfactual fine-tuning to curb unwarranted demographic inference. Code and data will be released on acceptance.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Multi-task post-training of large language models (LLMs) is typically performed by mixing datasets from different tasks and optimizing them jointly. This approach implicitly assumes that all tasks contribute gradients of similar magnitudes; when this assumption fails, optimization becomes biased toward large-gradient tasks. In this paper, however, we show that this assumption fails in RL post-training: certain tasks produce significantly larger gradients, thus biasing updates toward those tasks. Such gradient imbalance would be justified only if larger gradients implied larger learning gains on the tasks (i.e., larger performance improvements) -- but we find this is not true. Large-gradient tasks can achieve similar or even much lower learning gains than small-gradient ones. Further analyses reveal that these gradient imbalances cannot be explained by typical training statistics such as training rewards or advantages, suggesting that they arise from the inherent differences between tasks. This cautions against naive dataset mixing and calls for future work on principled gradient-level corrections for LLMs.

      Consensus building is inherently challenging due to the diverse opinions held by stakeholders. Effective facilitation is crucial to support the consensus building process and enable efficient group decision making. However, the effectiveness of facilitation is often constrained by human factors such as limited experience and scalability. In this research, we propose a Parallel Thinking-based Facilitation Agent (PTFA) that facilitates online, text-based consensus building processes.The PTFA automatically collects real-time textual input and leverages large language models (LLMs)to perform all six distinct roles of the well-established Six Thinking Hats technique in parallel thinking.To illustrate the potential of the agent, a pilot study was conducted, demonstrating its capabilities in idea generation, emotional probing, and deeper analysis of idea quality. Additionally, future open research challenges such as optimizing scheduling and managing behaviors in divergent phase are identified. Furthermore, a comprehensive dataset that contains not only the conversational content among the participants but also between the participants and the agent is constructed for future study.

      Balancing performance and efficiency is a central challenge in large language model (LLM) advancement. GPT-5 addresses this with test-time routing, dynamically assigning queries to either an efficient or a high-capacity model during inference. In this work, we present Avengers-Pro, a test-time routing framework that ensembles LLMs of varying capacities and efficiencies, providing a unified solution for all performance-efficiency tradeoffs. The Avengers-Pro embeds and clusters incoming queries, then routes each to the most suitable model based on a performance-efficiency score. Across 6 challenging benchmarks and 8 leading models -- including GPT-5-medium, Gemini-2.5-pro, and Claude-opus-4.1 -- Avengers-Pro achieves state-of-the-art results: by varying a performance-efficiency trade-off parameter, it can surpass the strongest single model (GPT-5-medium) by +7% in average accuracy. Moreover, it can match the average accuracy of the strongest single model at 27% lower cost, and reach ~90% of that performance at 63% lower cost. Last but not least, it achieves a Pareto frontier, consistently yielding the highest accuracy for any given cost, and the lowest cost for any given accuracy, among all single models.

      LLMs often fail to handle temporal knowledge conflicts--contradictions arising when facts evolve over time within their training data. Existing studies evaluate this phenomenon through benchmarks built on structured knowledge bases like Wikidata, but they focus on widely-covered, easily-memorized popular entities and lack the dynamic structure needed to fairly evaluate LLMs with different knowledge cut-off dates. We introduce evolveQA, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs on temporally evolving knowledge, constructed from 3 real-world, time-stamped corpora: AWS updates, Azure changes, and WHO disease outbreak reports. Our framework identifies naturally occurring knowledge evolution and generates questions with gold answers tailored to different LLM knowledge cut-off dates. Through extensive evaluation of 12 open and closed-source LLMs across 3 knowledge probing formats, we demonstrate significant performance drops of up to 31% on evolveQA compared to static knowledge questions.

      Large language models (LLMs) and their multimodal variants can now process visual inputs, including images of text. This raises an intriguing question: can we compress textual inputs by feeding them as images to reduce token usage while preserving performance? In this paper, we show that visual text representations are a practical and surprisingly effective form of input compression for decoder LLMs. We exploit the idea of rendering long text inputs as a single image and provide it directly to the model. This leads to dramatically reduced number of decoder tokens required, offering a new form of input compression. Through experiments on two distinct benchmarks RULER (long-context retrieval) and CNN/DailyMail (document summarization) we demonstrate that this text-as-image method yields substantial token savings (often nearly half) without degrading task performance.

      Product search is a crucial component of modern e-commerce platforms, with billions of user queries every day. In product search systems, first-stage retrieval should achieve high recall while ensuring efficient online deployment. Sparse retrieval is particularly attractive in this context due to its interpretability and storage efficiency. However, sparse retrieval methods suffer from severe vocabulary mismatch issues, leading to suboptimal performance in product search scenarios. With their potential for semantic analysis, large language models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue for mitigating vocabulary mismatch issues and thereby improving retrieval quality. Directly applying LLMs to sparse retrieval in product search exposes two key challenges:(1)Queries and product titles are typically short and highly susceptible to LLM-induced hallucinations, such as generating irrelevant expansion terms or underweighting critical literal terms like brand names and model numbers;(2)The large vocabulary space of LLMs leads to difficulty in initializing training effectively, making it challenging to learn meaningful sparse representations in such ultra-high-dimensional spaces.To address these challenges, we propose PROSPER, a framework for PROduct search leveraging LLMs as SParsE Retrievers. PROSPER incorporates: (1)A literal residual network that alleviates hallucination in lexical expansion by reinforcing underweighted literal terms through a residual compensation mechanism; and (2)A lexical focusing window that facilitates effective training initialization via a coarse-to-fine sparsification strategy.Extensive offline and online experiments show that PROSPER significantly outperforms sparse baselines and achieves recall performance comparable to advanced dense retrievers, while also achieving revenue increments online.

      Machine unlearning techniques aim to mitigate unintended memorization in large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches predominantly focus on the explicit removal of isolated facts, often overlooking latent inferential dependencies and the non-deterministic nature of knowledge within LLMs. Consequently, facts presumed forgotten may persist implicitly through correlated information. To address these challenges, we propose a knowledge unlearning evaluation framework that more accurately captures the implicit structure of real-world knowledge by representing relevant factual contexts as knowledge graphs with associated confidence scores. We further develop an inference-based evaluation protocol leveraging powerful LLMs as judges; these judges reason over the extracted knowledge subgraph to determine unlearning success. Our LLM judges utilize carefully designed prompts and are calibrated against human evaluations to ensure their trustworthiness and stability. Extensive experiments on our newly constructed benchmark demonstrate that our framework provides a more realistic and rigorous assessment of unlearning performance. Moreover, our findings reveal that current evaluation strategies tend to overestimate unlearning effectiveness.

      Context lengths for models have grown rapidly, from thousands to millions of tokens in just a few years. The extreme context sizes of modern long-context models have made it difficult to construct realistic long-context benchmarks -- not only due to the cost of collecting million-context tasks but also in identifying realistic scenarios that require significant contexts. We identify code comprehension and repair as a natural testbed and challenge task for long-context models and introduce LongCodeBench (LCB), a benchmark to test LLM coding abilities in long-context scenarios. Our benchmark tests both the comprehension and repair capabilities of LCLMs in realistic and important settings by drawing from real-world GitHub issues and constructing QA (LongCodeQA) and bug fixing (LongSWE-Bench) tasks. We carefully stratify the complexity of our benchmark, enabling us to evaluate models across different scales -- ranging from Qwen2.5 14B Instruct to Google's flagship Gemini model. We find that long-context remains a weakness for all models, with performance drops such as from 29% to 3% for Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or from 70.2% to 40% for Qwen2.5.

      A meaningful text can be hidden inside another, completely different yet still coherent and plausible, text of the same length. For example, a tweet containing a harsh political critique could be embedded in a tweet that celebrates the same political leader, or an ordinary product review could conceal a secret manuscript. This uncanny state of affairs is now possible thanks to Large Language Models, and in this paper we present a simple and efficient protocol to achieve it. We show that even modest 8-billion-parameter open-source LLMs are sufficient to obtain high-quality results, and a message as long as this abstract can be encoded and decoded locally on a laptop in seconds. The existence of such a protocol demonstrates a radical decoupling of text from authorial intent, further eroding trust in written communication, already shaken by the rise of LLM chatbots. We illustrate this with a concrete scenario: a company could covertly deploy an unfiltered LLM by encoding its answers within the compliant responses of a safe model. This possibility raises urgent questions for AI safety and challenges our understanding of what it means for a Large Language Model to know something.

      Software supply-chain attacks are an important and ongoing concern in the open source software ecosystem. These attacks maintain the standard functionality that a component implements, but additionally hide malicious functionality activated only when the component reaches its target environment. Lexo addresses such stealthy attacks by automatically learning and regenerating vulnerability-free versions of potentially malicious components. Lexo first generates a set of input-output pairs to model a component's full observable behavior, which it then uses to synthesize a new version of the original component. The new component implements the original functionality but avoids stealthy malicious behavior. Throughout this regeneration process, Lexo consults several distinct instances of Large Language Models (LLMs), uses correctness and coverage metrics to shepherd these instances, and guardrails their results. Our evaluation on 100+ real-world packages, including high profile stealthy supply-chain attacks, indicates that Lexo scales across multiple domains, regenerates code efficiently (<100s on average), maintains compatibility, and succeeds in eliminating malicious code in several real-world supply-chain-attacks, even in cases when a state-of-the-art LLM fails to eliminate malicious code when prompted to do so.

      We propose Heterogeneous Swarms, an algorithm to design multi-LLM systems by jointly optimizing model roles and weights. We represent multi-LLM systems as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of LLMs with topological message passing for collaborative generation. Given a pool of LLM experts and a utility function, Heterogeneous Swarms employs two iterative steps: role-step and weight-step. For role-step, we interpret model roles as learning a DAG that specifies the flow of inputs and outputs between LLMs. Starting from a swarm of random continuous adjacency matrices, we decode them into discrete DAGs, call the LLMs in topological order, evaluate on the utility function (e.g. accuracy on a task), and optimize the adjacency matrices with particle swarm optimization based on the utility score. For weight-step, we assess the contribution of individual LLMs in the multi-LLM systems and optimize model weights with swarm intelligence. We propose JFK-score to quantify the individual contribution of each LLM in the best-found DAG of the role-step, then optimize model weights with particle swarm optimization based on the JFK-score. Experiments demonstrate that Heterogeneous Swarms outperforms 15 role- and/or weight-based baselines by 18.5% on average across 12 tasks. Further analysis reveals that Heterogeneous Swarms discovers multi-LLM systems with heterogeneous model roles and substantial collaborative gains, and benefits from the diversity of language models.

We design an algorithm that provably competes with the best draft model in hindsight for each query in terms of either the token acceptance probability or expected acceptance length. In particular, we show that we can accurately evaluate all draft models, instead of only the chosen model without incurring additional queries to the target model, which allows us to improve exponentially over the existing bandit-based approach as the number of draft models increases. Our approach is generically applicable with any speculative decoding methods (single draft, multi-drafts and draft-trees). Moreover, we design system-efficient versions of online learners and demonstrate that the overhead in computation and latency can be substantially reduced. We conduct extensive experiments on open-source LLMs and diverse datasets, demonstrating that our methods substantially outperform the state-of-the-art EAGLE3 and the BanditSpec baseline in a variety of domains where specialized domain-expert drafters are available, especially when long reasoning chains are required.

Prior research examined how LLMs alter user views, yet little work extended beyond one-way influence to address how user input can affect LLM responses and how such bi-directional influence manifests throughout the multi-turn conversations. This study investigates this dynamic through 50 controversial-topic discussions with participants (N=266) across three conditions: static statements, standard chatbot, and personalized chatbot. Results show that human opinions barely shifted, while LLM outputs changed more substantially, narrowing the gap between human and LLM stance. Personalization amplified these shifts in both directions compared to the standard setting. Analysis of multi-turn conversations further revealed that exchanges involving participants' personal stories were most likely to trigger stance changes for both humans and LLMs. Our work highlights the risk of over-alignment in human-LLM interaction and the need for careful design of personalized chatbots to more thoughtfully and stably align with users.

      Large language models (LLMs) typically generate identical or similar responses for all users given the same prompt, posing serious safety risks in high-stakes applications where user vulnerabilities differ widely. Existing safety evaluations primarily rely on context-independent metrics - such as factuality, bias, or toxicity - overlooking the fact that the same response may carry divergent risks depending on the user's background or condition. We introduce personalized safety to fill this gap and present PENGUIN - a benchmark comprising 14,000 scenarios across seven sensitive domains with both context-rich and context-free variants. Evaluating six leading LLMs, we demonstrate that personalized user information significantly improves safety scores by 43.2%, confirming the effectiveness of personalization in safety alignment. However, not all context attributes contribute equally to safety enhancement. To address this, we develop RAISE - a training-free, two-stage agent framework that strategically acquires user-specific background. RAISE improves safety scores by up to 31.6% over six vanilla LLMs, while maintaining a low interaction cost of just 2.7 user queries on average. Our findings highlight the importance of selective information gathering in safety-critical domains and offer a practical solution for personalizing LLM responses without model retraining. This work establishes a foundation for safety research that adapts to individual user contexts rather than assuming a universal harm standard.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning, yet sometimes produce responses that are suboptimal for users in tasks such as writing, information seeking, or providing practical guidance. Conventional alignment practices typically assume that maximizing model reward also maximizes user welfare, but this assumption frequently fails in practice: models may over-clarify or generate overly verbose reasoning when users prefer concise answers. Such behaviors resemble the prisoner's dilemma, where individually rational choices lead to socially suboptimal outcomes. The fundamental challenge is the lack of a principled decision making mechanism that mutually benefits both the LLM and the user. We propose Game-Theoretic Alignment (GTAlign), an alignment framework that integrates game-theoretic decision making into both reasoning and training. During reasoning, the model explicitly treats user-LLM interaction as a strategic game: it constructs payoff matrices within its reasoning chain to estimate welfare for both itself and the user, and then selects actions that are mutually beneficial. During training, we introduce a mutual welfare reward that reinforces cooperative responses, aligning model behavior with socially efficient outcomes. In addition, we introduce an inference technique that leverages game-theoretic reasoning to dynamically adapt LLM's response when pricing policies of LLM service change. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GTAlign substantially improves reasoning efficiency, answer quality, and mutual welfare compared to baselines across diverse tasks.

      Despite the broad applicability of large language models (LLMs), their reliance on probabilistic inference makes them vulnerable to errors such as hallucination in generated facts and inconsistent output structure in natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. By contrast, symbolic NLU systems provide interpretable understanding grounded in curated lexicons, semantic resources, and syntactic & semantic interpretation rules. They produce relational representations that can be used for accurate reasoning and planning, as well as incremental debuggable learning. However, symbolic NLU systems tend to be more limited in coverage than LLMs and require scarce knowledge representation and linguistics skills to extend and maintain. This paper explores a hybrid approach that integrates the broad-coverage language processing of LLMs with the symbolic NLU capabilities of producing structured relational representations to hopefully get the best of both approaches. We use LLMs for rephrasing and text simplification, to provide broad coverage, and as a source of information to fill in knowledge gaps more automatically. We use symbolic NLU to produce representations that can be used for reasoning and for incremental learning. We evaluate this approach on the task of extracting and interpreting quantities and causal laws from commonsense science texts, along with symbolic- and LLM-only pipelines. Our results suggest that our hybrid method works significantly better than the symbolic-only pipeline.

      This paper presents a novel methodology for classifying early modern religious images by using Large Language Models (LLMs) and vector databases in combination with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The approach leverages the full-page context of book illustrations from the Holy Roman Empire, allowing the LLM to generate detailed descriptions that incorporate both visual and textual elements. These descriptions are then matched to relevant Iconclass codes through a hybrid vector search. This method achieves 87% and 92% precision at five and four levels of classification, significantly outperforming traditional image and keyword-based searches. By employing full-page descriptions and RAG, the system enhances classification accuracy, offering a powerful tool for large-scale analysis of early modern visual archives. This interdisciplinary approach demonstrates the growing potential of LLMs and RAG in advancing research within art history and digital humanities.

      Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI), and in particular large language models (LLMs), are increasingly being explored as tools to support life cycle assessment (LCA). While demonstrations exist across environmental and social domains, systematic evidence on their reliability, robustness, and usability remains limited. This study provides the first expert-grounded benchmark of LLMs in LCA, addressing the absence of standardized evaluation frameworks in a field where no clear ground truth or consensus protocols exist. Methods: We evaluated eleven general-purpose LLMs, spanning both commercial and open-source families, across 22 LCA-related tasks. Seventeen experienced practitioners reviewed model outputs against criteria directly relevant to LCA practice, including scientific accuracy, explanation quality, robustness, verifiability, and adherence to instructions. We collected 168 expert reviews. Results: Experts judged 37% of responses to contain inaccurate or misleading information. Ratings of accuracy and quality of explanation were generally rated average or good on many models even smaller models, and format adherence was generally rated favourably. Hallucination rates varied significantly, with some models producing hallucinated citations at rates of up to 40%. There was no clear-cut distinction between ratings on open-weight versus closed-weight LLMs, with open-weight models outperforming or competing on par with closed-weight models on criteria such as accuracy and quality of explanation. Conclusion: These findings highlight the risks of applying LLMs na\"ively in LCA, such as when LLMs are treated as free-form oracles, while also showing benefits especially around quality of explanation and alleviating labour intensiveness of simple tasks. The use of general-purpose LLMs without grounding mechanisms presents ...
