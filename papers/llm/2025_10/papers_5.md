      Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language and multimodal domains. By fine-tuning multimodal LLMs with temporal annotations from well-annotated datasets, e.g., dense video captioning datasets, their temporal understanding capacity in video-language tasks can be obtained. However, there is a notable lack of untrimmed audio-visual video datasets with precise temporal annotations for events. This deficiency hinders LLMs from learning the alignment between time, audio-visual events, and text tokens, thus impairing their ability to temporally localize audio-visual events in videos. To address this gap, we introduce PU-VALOR, a comprehensive audio-visual dataset comprising over 114,000 pseudo-untrimmed videos with detailed temporal annotations. PU-VALOR is derived from the large-scale but coarse-annotated audio-visual dataset VALOR, through a subtle method involving event-based video clustering, random temporal scaling, and permutation. By fine-tuning a multimodal LLM on PU-VALOR, we developed AVicuna, a model capable of aligning audio-visual events with temporal intervals and corresponding text tokens. AVicuna excels in temporal localization and time-aware dialogue capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate that AVicuna effectively handles temporal understanding in audio-visual videos and achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-ended video QA, audio-visual QA, and audio-visual event dense localization tasks.

      Evaluating large language model (LLM) outputs in the legal domain presents unique challenges due to the complex and nuanced nature of legal analysis. Current evaluation approaches either depend on reference data, which is costly to produce, or use standardized assessment methods, both of which have significant limitations for legal applications. Although LLM-as-a-Judge has emerged as a promising evaluation technique, its reliability and effectiveness in legal contexts depend heavily on evaluation processes unique to the legal industry and how trustworthy the evaluation appears to the human legal expert. This is where existing evaluation methods currently fail and exhibit considerable variability. This paper aims to close the gap: a) we break down lengthy responses into 'Legal Data Points' (LDPs), self-contained units of information, and introduce a novel, reference-free evaluation methodology that reflects how lawyers evaluate legal answers; b) we demonstrate that our method outperforms a variety of baselines on both our proprietary dataset and an open-source dataset (LegalBench); c) we show how our method correlates more closely with human expert evaluations and helps improve inter-annotator agreement; and finally d) we open source our Legal Data Points for a subset of LegalBench used in our experiments, allowing the research community to replicate our results and advance research in this vital area of LLM evaluation on legal question-answering.

      Automated red-teaming has emerged as a scalable approach for auditing Large Language Models (LLMs) prior to deployment, yet existing approaches lack mechanisms to efficiently adapt to model-specific vulnerabilities at inference. We introduce Red-Bandit, a red-teaming framework that adapts online to identify and exploit model failure modes under distinct attack styles (e.g., manipulation, slang). Red-Bandit post-trains a set of parameter-efficient LoRA experts, each specialized for a particular attack style, using reinforcement learning that rewards the generation of unsafe prompts via a rule-based safety model. At inference, a multi-armed bandit policy dynamically selects among these attack-style experts based on the target model's response safety, balancing exploration and exploitation. Red-Bandit achieves state-of-the-art results on AdvBench under sufficient exploration (ASR@10), while producing more human-readable prompts (lower perplexity). Moreover, Red-Bandit's bandit policy serves as a diagnostic tool for uncovering model-specific vulnerabilities by indicating which attack styles most effectively elicit unsafe behaviors.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Causal reasoning is fundamental for Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand genuine cause-and-effect relationships beyond pattern matching. Existing benchmarks suffer from critical limitations such as reliance on synthetic data and narrow domain coverage. We introduce a novel benchmark constructed from casually identified relationships extracted from top-tier economics and finance journals, drawing on rigorous methodologies including instrumental variables, difference-in-differences, and regression discontinuity designs. Our benchmark comprises 40,379 evaluation items covering five task types across domains such as health, environment, technology, law, and culture. Experimental results on eight state-of-the-art LLMs reveal substantial limitations, with the best model achieving only 57.6\% accuracy. Moreover, model scale does not consistently translate to superior performance, and even advanced reasoning models struggle with fundamental causal relationship identification. These findings underscore a critical gap between current LLM capabilities and demands of reliable causal reasoning in high-stakes applications.

      Simulating step-wise human behavior with Large Language Models (LLMs) has become an emerging research direction, enabling applications in various practical domains. While prior methods, including prompting, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning (RL), have shown promise in modeling step-wise behavior, they primarily learn a population-level policy without conditioning on a user's persona, yielding generic rather than personalized simulations. In this work, we pose a critical question: how can LLM agents better simulate personalized user behavior? We introduce Customer-R1, an RL-based method for personalized, step-wise user behavior simulation in online shopping environments. Our policy is conditioned on an explicit persona, and we optimize next-step rationale and action generation via action correctness reward signals. Experiments on the OPeRA dataset emonstrate that Customer-R1 not only significantly outperforms prompting and SFT-based baselines in next-action prediction tasks, but also better matches users' action distribution, indicating higher fidelity in personalized behavior simulation.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Poisoning attacks can compromise the safety of large language models (LLMs) by injecting malicious documents into their training data. Existing work has studied pretraining poisoning assuming adversaries control a percentage of the training corpus. However, for large models, even small percentages translate to impractically large amounts of data. This work demonstrates for the first time that poisoning attacks instead require a near-constant number of documents regardless of dataset size. We conduct the largest pretraining poisoning experiments to date, pretraining models from 600M to 13B parameters on chinchilla-optimal datasets (6B to 260B tokens). We find that 250 poisoned documents similarly compromise models across all model and dataset sizes, despite the largest models training on more than 20 times more clean data. We also run smaller-scale experiments to ablate factors that could influence attack success, including broader ratios of poisoned to clean data and non-random distributions of poisoned samples. Finally, we demonstrate the same dynamics for poisoning during fine-tuning. Altogether, our results suggest that injecting backdoors through data poisoning may be easier for large models than previously believed as the number of poisons required does not scale up with model size, highlighting the need for more research on defences to mitigate this risk in future models.

      Are large language models (LLMs) sensitive to the distinction between humanly possible languages and humanly impossible languages? This question is taken by many to bear on whether LLMs and humans share the same innate learning biases. Previous work has attempted to answer it in the positive by comparing LLM learning curves on existing language datasets and on "impossible" datasets derived from them via various perturbation functions. Using the same methodology, we examine this claim on a wider set of languages and impossible perturbations. We find that in most cases, GPT-2 learns each language and its impossible counterpart equally easily, in contrast to previous claims. We also apply a more lenient condition by testing whether GPT-2 provides any kind of separation between the whole set of natural languages and the whole set of impossible languages. By considering cross-linguistic variance in various metrics computed on the perplexity curves, we show that GPT-2 provides no systematic separation between the possible and the impossible. Taken together, these perspectives show that LLMs do not share the human innate biases that shape linguistic typology.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents that orchestrate tasks and integrate external tools to execute complex workflows. We demonstrate that these interactive behaviors leave distinctive fingerprints in encrypted traffic exchanged between users and LLM agents. By analyzing traffic patterns associated with agent workflows and tool invocations, adversaries can infer agent activities, distinguish specific agents, and even profile sensitive user attributes. To highlight this risk, we develop AgentPrint, which achieves an F1-score of 0.866 in agent identification and attains 73.9% and 69.1% top-3 accuracy in user attribute inference for simulated- and real-user settings, respectively. These results uncover an overlooked risk: the very interactivity that empowers LLM agents also exposes user privacy, underscoring the urgent need for technical countermeasures alongside regulatory and policy safeguards.

      Recent studies apply psychometric questionnaires to Large Language Models (LLMs) to assess high-level psychological constructs such as values, personality, moral foundations, and dark traits. Although prior work has raised concerns about possible data contamination from psychometric inventories, which may threaten the reliability of such evaluations, there has been no systematic attempt to quantify the extent of this contamination. To address this gap, we propose a framework to systematically measure data contamination in psychometric evaluations of LLMs, evaluating three aspects: (1) item memorization, (2) evaluation memorization, and (3) target score matching. Applying this framework to 21 models from major families and four widely used psychometric inventories, we provide evidence that popular inventories such as the Big Five Inventory (BFI-44) and Portrait Values Questionnaire (PVQ-40) exhibit strong contamination, where models not only memorize items but can also adjust their responses to achieve specific target scores.

      Large language models are emerging as powerful tools for scientific law discovery, a foundational challenge in AI-driven science. However, existing benchmarks for this task suffer from a fundamental methodological trilemma, forcing a trade-off between scientific relevance, scalability, and resistance to memorization. Furthermore, they oversimplify discovery as static function fitting, failing to capture the authentic scientific process of uncovering embedded laws through the interactive exploration of complex model systems. To address these critical gaps, we introduce NewtonBench, a benchmark comprising 324 scientific law discovery tasks across 12 physics domains. Our design mitigates the evaluation trilemma by using metaphysical shifts - systematic alterations of canonical laws - to generate a vast suite of problems that are scalable, scientifically relevant, and memorization-resistant. Moreover, we elevate the evaluation from static function fitting to interactive model discovery, requiring agents to experimentally probe simulated complex systems to uncover hidden principles. Our extensive experiment reveals a clear but fragile capability for discovery in frontier LLMs: this ability degrades precipitously with increasing system complexity and exhibits extreme sensitivity to observational noise. Notably, we uncover a paradoxical effect of tool assistance: providing a code interpreter can hinder more capable models by inducing a premature shift from exploration to exploitation, causing them to satisfice on suboptimal solutions. These results demonstrate that robust, generalizable discovery in complex, interactive environments remains the core challenge. By providing a scalable, robust, and scientifically authentic testbed, NewtonBench offers a crucial tool for measuring true progress and guiding the development of next-generation AI agents capable of genuine scientific discovery.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Sarcasm is a subtle form of non-literal language that poses significant challenges for speech synthesis due to its reliance on nuanced semantic, contextual, and prosodic cues. While existing speech synthesis research has focused primarily on broad emotional categories, sarcasm remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-enhanced Retrieval-Augmented framework for sarcasm-aware speech synthesis. Our approach combines (1) semantic embeddings from a LoRA-fine-tuned LLaMA 3, which capture pragmatic incongruity and discourse-level cues of sarcasm, and (2) prosodic exemplars retrieved via a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) module, which provide expressive reference patterns of sarcastic delivery. Integrated within a VITS backbone, this dual conditioning enables more natural and contextually appropriate sarcastic speech. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines in both objective measures and subjective evaluations, yielding improvements in speech naturalness, sarcastic expressivity, and downstream sarcasm detection.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) optimized to output truthful answers often overfit, producing brittle reasoning that fails to generalize. While persuasion-based optimization has shown promise in debate settings, it has not been systematically compared against mainstream truth-based approaches. We introduce DebateQD, a minimal Quality-Diversity (QD) evolutionary algorithm that evolves diverse debate strategies across different categories (rationality, authority, emotional appeal, etc.) through tournament-style competitions where two LLMs debate while a third judges. Unlike previously proposed methods that require a population of LLMs, our approach maintains diversity of opponents through prompt-based strategies within a single LLM architecture, making it more accessible for experiments while preserving the key benefits of population-based optimization. In contrast to prior work, we explicitly isolate the role of the optimization objective by fixing the debate protocol and swapping only the fitness function: persuasion rewards strategies that convince the judge irrespective of truth, whereas truth rewards collaborative correctness. Across three model scales (7B, 32B, 72B parameters) and multiple dataset sizes from the QuALITY benchmark, persuasion-optimized strategies achieve up to 13.94% smaller train-test generalization gaps, while matching or exceeding truth optimization's test performance. These results provide the first controlled evidence that competitive pressure to persuade, rather than seek the truth collaboratively, fosters more transferable reasoning skills, offering a promising path for improving LLM generalization.

      Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has improved the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by using rule-based binary feedback. However, current RLVR methods typically assign the same reward to every token. This coarse-grained feedback hampers precise credit assignment, making it hard for models to identify which reasoning steps lead to success or failure, and often results in suboptimal policies. Methods like PPO provide credit assignment by value estimation, but yield inaccurate and unverifiable signals due to limited sampling. On the other hand, methods using Process Reward Models can provide step-wise rewards but suffer from several key limitations: they require high-quality process supervision labels, the feedback is unreliable due to probabilistic reward modeling, and their application in online reinforcement learning (RL) is time-consuming. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a simple but efficient method-Credit Assignment Policy Optimization (CAPO). Instead of training auxiliary models, CAPO directly leverages an off-the-shelf, general-purpose LLM as a Generative Process Reward Model (LLM-as-GenPRM) to generate all step-wise critique by one pass only based on the correctness of the step itself, providing deterministic token-level credits to refine the tokens that were originally assigned identical rule-based rewards. To further enhance the accuracy and robustness, we employ voting mechanisms that scale with the number of generated critiques. Extensive experiments on various backbones like Llama and Qwen models show that CAPO consistently outperforms supervised learning-based and RL-based fine-tuning methods across four challenging mathematical benchmarks and three out-of-domain benchmarks. Further analysis shows that CAPO can help the model to foster the learning of correct reasoning pathways leading to correct answers.

      Effective model and hyperparameter selection remains a major challenge in deep learning, often requiring extensive expertise and computation. While AutoML and large language models (LLMs) promise automation, current LLM-based approaches rely on trial and error and expensive APIs, which provide limited interpretability and generalizability. We propose MetaLLMiX, a zero-shot hyperparameter optimization framework combining meta-learning, explainable AI, and efficient LLM reasoning. By leveraging historical experiment outcomes with SHAP explanations, MetaLLMiX recommends optimal hyperparameters and pretrained models without additional trials. We further employ an LLM-as-judge evaluation to control output format, accuracy, and completeness. Experiments on eight medical imaging datasets using nine open-source lightweight LLMs show that MetaLLMiX achieves competitive or superior performance to traditional HPO methods while drastically reducing computational cost. Our local deployment outperforms prior API-based approaches, achieving optimal results on 5 of 8 tasks, response time reductions of 99.6-99.9%, and the fastest training times on 6 datasets (2.4-15.7x faster), maintaining accuracy within 1-5% of best-performing baselines.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      In a recent study, Lu, Song, and Zhang (2025) (LSZ) propose that large language models (LLMs), when prompted in different languages, display culturally specific tendencies. They report that the two models (i.e., GPT and ERNIE) respond in more interdependent and holistic ways when prompted in Chinese, and more independent and analytic ways when prompted in English. LSZ attribute these differences to deep-seated cultural patterns in the models, claiming that prompt language alone can induce substantial cultural shifts. While we acknowledge the empirical patterns they observed, we find their experiments, methods, and interpretations problematic. In this paper, we critically re-evaluate the methodology, theoretical framing, and conclusions of LSZ. We argue that the reported "cultural tendencies" are not stable traits but fragile artifacts of specific models and task design. To test this, we conducted targeted replications using a broader set of LLMs and a larger number of test items. Our results show that prompt language has minimal effect on outputs, challenging LSZ's claim that these models encode grounded cultural beliefs.

      Large language models (LLMs) increasingly support applications that rely on extended context, from document processing to retrieval-augmented generation. While their long-context capabilities are well studied for reasoning and retrieval, little is known about their behavior in safety-critical scenarios. We evaluate LLMs' sensitivity to harmful content under extended context, varying type (explicit vs. implicit), position (beginning, middle, end), prevalence (0.01-0.50 of the prompt), and context length (600-6000 tokens). Across harmful content categories such as toxic, offensive, and hate speech, with LLaMA-3, Qwen-2.5, and Mistral, we observe similar patterns: performance peaks at moderate harmful prevalence (0.25) but declines when content is very sparse or dominant; recall decreases with increasing context length; harmful sentences at the beginning are generally detected more reliably; and explicit content is more consistently recognized than implicit. These findings provide the first systematic view of how LLMs prioritize and calibrate harmful content in long contexts, highlighting both their emerging strengths and the challenges that remain for safety-critical use.

      Large language models (LLMs) are typically aligned to refuse harmful instructions through safety fine-tuning. A recent attack, termed abliteration, identifies and suppresses the single latent direction most responsible for refusal behavior, thereby enabling models to generate harmful content. We propose a defense that fundamentally alters how models express refusal. We construct an extended-refusal dataset in which responses to harmful prompts provide detailed justifications before refusing, distributing the refusal signal across multiple token positions. Fine-tuning Llama-2-7B-Chat and Qwen2.5-Instruct (1.5B and 3B parameters) on this dataset yields models that maintain high refusal rates under abliteration: refusal rates drop by at most 10%, compared to 70-80% drops in baseline models. Comprehensive evaluations of safety and utility demonstrate that extended-refusal fine-tuning effectively neutralizes abliteration attacks while preserving general model performance and enhancing robustness across multiple alignment scenarios.

      With the rapid growth of academic publications, peer review has become an essential yet time-consuming responsibility within the research community. Large Language Models (LLMs) have increasingly been adopted to assist in the generation of review comments; however, current LLM-based review tasks lack a unified evaluation benchmark to rigorously assess the models' ability to produce comprehensive, accurate, and human-aligned assessments, particularly in scenarios involving multimodal content such as figures and tables. To address this gap, we propose \textbf{MMReview}, a comprehensive benchmark that spans multiple disciplines and modalities. MMReview includes multimodal content and expert-written review comments for 240 papers across 17 research domains within four major academic disciplines: Artificial Intelligence, Natural Sciences, Engineering Sciences, and Social Sciences. We design a total of 13 tasks grouped into four core categories, aimed at evaluating the performance of LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) in step-wise review generation, outcome formulation, alignment with human preferences, and robustness to adversarial input manipulation. Extensive experiments conducted on 16 open-source models and 5 advanced closed-source models demonstrate the thoroughness of the benchmark. We envision MMReview as a critical step toward establishing a standardized foundation for the development of automated peer review systems.

      Text clustering serves as a fundamental technique for organizing and interpreting unstructured textual data, particularly in contexts where manual annotation is prohibitively costly. With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their demonstrated effectiveness across a broad spectrum of NLP tasks, an emerging body of research has begun to explore their potential in the domain of text clustering. However, existing LLM-based approaches still rely on fine-tuned embedding models and sophisticated similarity metrics, rendering them computationally intensive and necessitating domain-specific adaptation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that reframes text clustering as a classification task by harnessing the in-context learning capabilities of LLMs. Our framework eliminates the need for fine-tuning embedding models or intricate clustering algorithms. It comprises two key steps: first, the LLM is prompted to generate a set of candidate labels based on the dataset and then merges semantically similar labels; second, it assigns the most appropriate label to each text sample. By leveraging the advanced natural language understanding and generalization capabilities of LLMs, the proposed approach enables effective clustering with minimal human intervention. Experimental results on diverse datasets demonstrate that our framework achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art embedding-based clustering techniques, while significantly reducing computational complexity and resource requirements. These findings underscore the transformative potential of LLMs in simplifying and enhancing text clustering tasks.

      Eliciting cooperation in multi-agent LLM systems is critical for AI alignment. We investigate two approaches: direct communication and curriculum learning. In a 4-player Stag Hunt, a one-word "cheap talk" channel increases cooperation from 0% to 48.3%, demonstrating communication as a robust coordination mechanism. In contrast, we find that curriculum learning is highly sensitive to design choices: our pedagogical curriculum through progressively complex games reduced agent payoffs by 27.4% in an Iterated Public Goods Game with Punishment. Qualitative analysis reveals that curricula emphasizing defection-equilibrium games can induce "learned pessimism" in agents. These findings suggest that for coordination problems, simple communication protocols may be more reliable than experience-based training, and that curriculum design for social dilemmas requires careful attention to the strategic lessons embedded in game sequences.

Additionally, Vipera leverages LLM-powered suggestions to facilitate exploration of unexplored auditing directions. Through a controlled experiment with 24 participants experienced in AI auditing, we demonstrate Vipera's effectiveness in helping auditors navigate large AI output spaces and organize their analyses while engaging with diverse criteria.

      Industrial fault diagnosis faces the dual challenges of data scarcity and the difficulty of deploying large AI models in resource-constrained environments. This paper introduces Syn-Diag, a novel cloud-edge synergistic framework that leverages Large Language Models to overcome these limitations in few-shot fault diagnosis. Syn-Diag is built on a three-tiered mechanism: 1) Visual-Semantic Synergy, which aligns signal features with the LLM's semantic space through cross-modal pre-training; 2) Content-Aware Reasoning, which dynamically constructs contextual prompts to enhance diagnostic accuracy with limited samples; and 3) Cloud-Edge Synergy, which uses knowledge distillation to create a lightweight, efficient edge model capable of online updates via a shared decision space. Extensive experiments on six datasets covering different CWRU and SEU working conditions show that Syn-Diag significantly outperforms existing methods, especially in 1-shot and cross-condition scenarios. The edge model achieves performance comparable to the cloud version while reducing model size by 83% and latency by 50%, offering a practical, robust, and deployable paradigm for modern intelligent diagnostics.

      Cognitive diagnostics in the Web-based Intelligent Education System (WIES) aims to assess students' mastery of knowledge concepts from heterogeneous, noisy interactions. Recent work has tried to utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) for cognitive diagnosis, yet LLMs struggle with structured data and are prone to noise-induced misjudgments. Specially, WIES's open environment continuously attracts new students and produces vast amounts of response logs, exacerbating the data imbalance and noise issues inherent in traditional educational systems. To address these challenges, we propose DLLM, a Diffusion-based LLM framework for noise-robust cognitive diagnosis. DLLM first constructs independent subgraphs based on response correctness, then applies relation augmentation alignment module to mitigate data imbalance. The two subgraph representations are then fused and aligned with LLM-derived, semantically augmented representations. Importantly, before each alignment step, DLLM employs a two-stage denoising diffusion module to eliminate intrinsic noise while assisting structural representation alignment. Specifically, unconditional denoising diffusion first removes erroneous information, followed by conditional denoising diffusion based on graph-guided to eliminate misleading information. Finally, the noise-robust representation that integrates semantic knowledge and structural information is fed into existing cognitive diagnosis models for prediction. Experimental results on three publicly available web-based educational platform datasets demonstrate that our DLLM achieves optimal predictive performance across varying noise levels, which demonstrates that DLLM achieves noise robustness while effectively leveraging semantic knowledge from LLM.

      Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in solving mathematical problems expressed in natural language. However, multilingual and culturally-grounded mathematical reasoning in low-resource languages lags behind English due to the scarcity of socio-cultural task datasets that reflect accurate native entities such as person names, organization names, and currencies. Existing multilingual benchmarks are predominantly produced via translation and typically retain English-centric entities, owing to the high cost associated with human annotater-based localization. Moreover, automated localization tools are limited, and hence, truly localized datasets remain scarce. To bridge this gap, we introduce a framework for LLM-driven cultural localization of math word problems that automatically constructs datasets with native names, organizations, and currencies from existing sources. We find that translated benchmarks can obscure true multilingual math ability under appropriate socio-cultural contexts. Through extensive experiments, we also show that our framework can help mitigate English-centric entity bias and improves robustness when native entities are introduced across various languages.

      Before adopting a new large language model (LLM) architecture, it is critical to understand vulnerabilities accurately. Existing evaluations can be difficult to trust, often drawing conclusions from LLMs that are not meaningfully comparable, relying on heuristic inputs or employing metrics that fail to capture the inherent uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a principled and practical end-to-end framework for evaluating LLM vulnerabilities to prompt injection attacks. First, we propose practical approaches to experimental design, tackling unfair LLM comparisons by considering two practitioner scenarios: when training an LLM and when deploying a pre-trained LLM. Second, we address the analysis of experiments and propose a Bayesian hierarchical model with embedding-space clustering. This model is designed to improve uncertainty quantification in the common scenario that LLM outputs are not deterministic, test prompts are designed imperfectly, and practitioners only have a limited amount of compute to evaluate vulnerabilities. We show the improved inferential capabilities of the model in several prompt injection attack settings. Finally, we demonstrate the pipeline to evaluate the security of Transformer versus Mamba architectures. Our findings show that consideration of output variability can suggest less definitive findings. However, for some attacks, we find notably increased Transformer and Mamba-variant vulnerabilities across LLMs with the same training data or mathematical ability.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      The widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) imposes increasing demands on safety, such as reducing harmful content and fake information, and avoiding certain forbidden tokens due to rules and laws. While there have been several recent works studying safe alignment of LLMs, these works either require the training of reward and cost models and incur high memory and computational costs, or need prior knowledge about the optimal solution. Motivated by this fact, we study the problem of constrained alignment in LLMs, i.e., maximizing the output reward while restricting the cost due to potentially unsafe content to stay below a threshold. For this problem, we propose a novel primal-dual DPO approach, which first trains a model using standard DPO on reward preference data to provide reward information, and then adopts a rearranged Lagrangian DPO objective utilizing the provided reward information to fine-tune LLMs on cost preference data. Our approach significantly reduces memory and computational costs, and does not require extra prior knowledge. Moreover, we establish rigorous theoretical guarantees on the suboptimality and constraint violation of the output policy. We also extend our approach to an online data setting by incorporating exploration bonuses, which enables our approach to explore uncovered prompt-response space, and then provide theoretical results that get rid of the dependence on preference data coverage. Experimental results on the widely-used preference dataset PKU-SafeRLHF demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

      With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), the demand for high-performance LLM inference services continues to grow. To meet this demand, a growing number of AI accelerators have been proposed, such as Google TPU, Huawei NPU, Graphcore IPU, and Cerebras WSE, etc. Most of these accelerators adopt multi-core architectures to achieve enhanced scalability, but lack the flexibility of SIMT architectures. Therefore, without careful configuration of the hardware architecture, as well as deliberate design of tensor parallelism and core placement strategies, computational resources may be underutilized, resulting in suboptimal inference performance. To address these challenges, we first present a multi-level simulation framework with both transaction-level and performance-model-based simulation for multi-core NPUs. Using this simulator, we conduct a systematic analysis and further propose the optimal solutions for tensor parallelism strategies, core placement policies, memory management methods, as well as the selection between PD-disaggregation and PD-fusion on multi-core NPUs. We conduct comprehensive experiments on representative LLMs and various NPU configurations. The evaluation results demonstrate that, our solution can achieve 1.32x-6.03x speedup compared to SOTA designs for multi-core NPUs across different hardware configurations. As for LLM serving, our work offers guidance on designing optimal hardware architectures and serving strategies for multi-core NPUs across various LLM workloads.

Our analysis reveals a fundamental limitation of this assumption: syntax-critical tokens such as keywords often exhibit the highest entropy, making existing approaches vulnerable to logic corruption. We present STONE, a syntax-aware watermarking method that embeds watermarks only in non-syntactic tokens and preserves code integrity. For its rigorous assessment, we also introduce STEM, a comprehensive framework that balances three critical dimensions: correctness, detectability, and imperceptibility.

      Penetration testing and vulnerability assessment are essential industry practices for safeguarding computer systems. As cyber threats grow in scale and complexity, the demand for pentesting has surged, surpassing the capacity of human professionals to meet it effectively. With advances in AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), there have been attempts to automate the pentesting process. However, existing tools such as PentestGPT are still semi-manual, requiring significant professional human interaction to conduct pentests. To this end, we propose a novel LLM agent-based framework, AutoPentester, which automates the pentesting process. Given a target IP, AutoPentester automatically conducts pentesting steps using common security tools in an iterative process. It can dynamically generate attack strategies based on the tool outputs from the previous iteration, mimicking the human pentester approach. We evaluate AutoPentester using Hack The Box and custom-made VMs, comparing the results with the state-of-the-art PentestGPT. Results show that AutoPentester achieves a 27.0% better subtask completion rate and 39.5% more vulnerability coverage with fewer steps. Most importantly, it requires significantly fewer human interactions and interventions compared to PentestGPT. Furthermore, we recruit a group of security industry professional volunteers for a user survey and perform a qualitative analysis to evaluate AutoPentester against industry practices and compare it with PentestGPT. On average, AutoPentester received a score of 3.93 out of 5 based on user reviews, which was 19.8% higher than PentestGPT.

      Recent agent-based recommendation frameworks aim to simulate user behaviors by incorporating memory mechanisms and prompting strategies, but they struggle with hallucinating non-existent items and full-catalog ranking. Besides, a largely underexplored opportunity lies in leveraging LLMs'commonsense reasoning to capture user intent through substitute and complement relationships between items, which are usually implicit in datasets and difficult for traditional ID-based recommenders to capture. In this work, we propose a novel LLM-agent framework, AgenDR, which bridges LLM reasoning with scalable recommendation tools. Our approach delegates full-ranking tasks to traditional models while utilizing LLMs to (i) integrate multiple recommendation outputs based on personalized tool suitability and (ii) reason over substitute and complement relationships grounded in user history. This design mitigates hallucination, scales to large catalogs, and enhances recommendation relevance through relational reasoning. Through extensive experiments on three public grocery datasets, we show that our framework achieves superior full-ranking performance, yielding on average a twofold improvement over its underlying tools. We also introduce a new LLM-based evaluation metric that jointly measures semantic alignment and ranking correctness.

      Privacy-sensitive users require deploying large language models (LLMs) within their own infrastructure (on-premises) to safeguard private data and enable customization. However, vulnerabilities in local environments can lead to unauthorized access and potential model theft. To address this, prior research on small models has explored securing only the output layer within hardware-secured devices to balance model confidentiality and customization. Yet this approach fails to protect LLMs effectively. In this paper, we discover that (1) query-based distillation attacks targeting the secured top layer can produce a functionally equivalent replica of the victim model; (2) securing the same number of layers, bottom layers before a transition layer provide stronger protection against distillation attacks than top layers, with comparable effects on customization performance; and (3) the number of secured layers creates a trade-off between protection and customization flexibility. Based on these insights, we propose SOLID, a novel deployment framework that secures a few bottom layers in a secure environment and introduces an efficient metric to optimize the trade-off by determining the ideal number of hidden layers. Extensive experiments on five models (1.3B to 70B parameters) demonstrate that SOLID outperforms baselines, achieving a better balance between protection and downstream customization.

      Federated instruction tuning of large language models (LLMs) is challenged by significant data heterogeneity across clients, demanding robust personalization. The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, where experts can specialize in distinct data patterns, presents a natural architectural solution to this challenge. The inherent sparsity of the MoE architecture, achieved by selectively activating experts, poses a significant challenge to its integration with federated learning (FL). Conventional FL frameworks, designed for dense models, naively aggregate all expert parameters irrespective of their local activation patterns. This naive approach not only undermines MoE's dynamic sparsity but also risks corrupting the world knowledge within pretrained experts. To address this, we propose FLEx (Federated LLMs with Personalized Experts), a novel framework that leverages pretrained MoE-based LLMs for efficient personalization. By aggregating only the shared non-expert parameters, FLEx significantly reduces communication overhead and preserves the world knowledge stored within the frozen pretrained experts. For personalization, we introduce a novel expert grafting mechanism that leverages dynamic sparsity to construct a client-specific expert from selected components of pretrained experts, tailored to local data. This grafted expert is then fine-tuned locally alongside the gating mechanism. This joint training enables the model to learn when to leverage the shared knowledge from frozen experts and when to employ the personalized one. Evaluations on diverse, non-IID instruction tuning datasets show that FLEx consistently outperforms federated baselines on average, while demonstrating strong knowledge preservation on the knowledge-driven benchmark MMLU.

      Machine learning models are known to leak sensitive information, as they inevitably memorize (parts of) their training data. More alarmingly, large language models (LLMs) are now trained on nearly all available data, which amplifies the magnitude of information leakage and raises serious privacy risks. Hence, it is more crucial than ever to quantify privacy risk before the release of LLMs. The standard method to quantify privacy is via membership inference attacks, where the state-of-the-art approach is the Robust Membership Inference Attack (RMIA). In this paper, we present InfoRMIA, a principled information-theoretic formulation of membership inference. Our method consistently outperforms RMIA across benchmarks while also offering improved computational efficiency. In the second part of the paper, we identify the limitations of treating sequence-level membership inference as the gold standard for measuring leakage. We propose a new perspective for studying membership and memorization in LLMs: token-level signals and analyses. We show that a simple token-based InfoRMIA can pinpoint which tokens are memorized within generated outputs, thereby localizing leakage from the sequence level down to individual tokens, while achieving stronger sequence-level inference power on LLMs. This new scope rethinks privacy in LLMs and can lead to more targeted mitigation, such as exact unlearning.

      Recent advancements in language agents have led to significant improvements in multi-hop reasoning tasks. However, existing approaches often struggle with handling open-domain problems, which require massive information retrieval due to their reliance on a fixed sequence of actions. To address this, we propose Feedback-Guided Dynamic Interactive Planning (FGDIP), a novel framework tailored to enhance reasoning in LLMs by utilizing dynamic and adaptive strategies for information exploration in open-domain multi-hop reasoning tasks. Our approach begins by identifying key entities relevant to the problem, which serve as the initial nodes in the reasoning process. From these initial nodes, we then generate reasoning child nodes with the process being refined through a combination of historical error analysis and real-time feedback, which allows the framework to dynamically adjust and optimize its reasoning strategies. By integrating depth-first search with an innovative node generation technique, our framework adapts based on both prior error paths and concurrently generated nodes at the same hierarchical level. This dynamic strategy effectively expands the search space while ensuring the reasoning process systematically converges toward accurate solutions. Experimental results show that FGDIP achieved up to 54.47% F1 score on the HotpotQA dataset and 70.05% on the StrategyQA dataset, surpassing the best baseline by 5.03% and 7.25% respectively, highlighting its versatility and potential to enhance language agents in multi-hop reasoning tasks.

      This paper investigates algorithmic bias in language-based models for automated depression detection, focusing on socio-demographic disparities related to gender and race/ethnicity. Models trained using deep neural networks (DNN) based embeddings are compared to few-shot learning approaches with large language models (LLMs), evaluating both performance and fairness on clinical interview transcripts from the Distress Analysis Interview Corpus/Wizard-of-Oz (DAIC-WOZ). To mitigate bias, fairness-aware loss functions are applied to DNN-based models, while in-context learning with varied prompt framing and shot counts is explored for LLMs. Results indicate that LLMs outperform DNN-based models in depression classification, particularly for underrepresented groups such as Hispanic participants. LLMs also exhibit reduced gender bias compared to DNN-based embeddings, though racial disparities persist. Among fairness-aware techniques for mitigating bias in DNN-based embeddings, the worst-group loss, which is designed to minimize loss for the worst-performing demographic group, achieves a better balance between performance and fairness. In contrast, the fairness-regularized loss minimizes loss across all groups but performs less effectively. In LLMs, guided prompting with ethical framing helps mitigate gender bias in the 1-shot setting. However, increasing the number of shots does not lead to further reductions in disparities. For race/ethnicity, neither prompting strategy nor increasing $N$ in $N$-shot learning effectively reduces disparities.

Based on our theoretical insights, we propose Pareto-Guided Singular Value Decomposition (PGSVD), a zero-shot pipeline that improves activation-aware compression via Pareto-guided rank selection and alternating least-squares implementation.

      Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for decision-making tasks under uncertainty; however, their risk profiles and how they are influenced by prompting and alignment methods remain underexplored. Existing studies have primarily examined personality prompting or multi-agent interactions, leaving open the question of how post-training influences the risk behavior of LLMs. In this work, we propose a new pipeline for eliciting, steering, and modulating LLMs' risk profiles, drawing on tools from behavioral economics and finance. Using utility-theoretic models, we compare pre-trained, instruction-tuned, and RLHF-aligned LLMs, and find that while instruction-tuned models exhibit behaviors consistent with some standard utility formulations, pre-trained and RLHF-aligned models deviate more from any utility models fitted. We further evaluate modulation strategies, including prompt engineering, in-context learning, and post-training, and show that post-training provides the most stable and effective modulation of risk preference. Our findings provide insights into the risk profiles of different classes and stages of LLMs and demonstrate how post-training modulates these profiles, laying the groundwork for future research on behavioral alignment and risk-aware LLM design.

To fill this void, we draw inspiration from Jean Piaget's Constructivist Theory, illuminating three traits of the agentic memory -- structured schemata, flexible assimilation, and dynamic accommodation. This blueprint forges a clear path toward a more robust and efficient memory system for LLM-based reading comprehension. To this end, we develop CAM, a prototype implementation of Constructivist Agentic Memory that simultaneously embodies the structurality, flexibility, and dynamicity. At its core, CAM is endowed with an incremental overlapping clustering algorithm for structured memory development, supporting both coherent hierarchical summarization and online batch integration. During inference, CAM adaptively explores the memory structure to activate query-relevant information for contextual response, akin to the human associative process. Compared to existing approaches, our design demonstrates dual advantages in both performance and efficiency across diverse long-text reading comprehension tasks, including question answering, query-based summarization, and claim verification.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Prompt underspecification is a common challenge when interacting with LLMs. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of this problem, showing that while LLMs can often infer unspecified requirements by default (41.1%), such behavior is fragile: Under-specified prompts are 2x as likely to regress across model or prompt changes, sometimes with accuracy drops exceeding 20%. This instability makes it difficult to reliably build LLM applications. Moreover, simply specifying all requirements does not consistently help, as models have limited instruction-following ability and requirements can conflict. Standard prompt optimizers likewise provide little benefit. To address these issues, we propose requirements-aware prompt optimization mechanisms that improve performance by 4.8% on average over baselines. We further advocate for a systematic process of proactive requirements discovery, evaluation, and monitoring to better manage prompt underspecification in practice.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) with Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures achieve remarkable performance improvements, but their random expert selection mechanism introduces significant data movement overhead that becomes the dominant bottleneck in multi-unit serving systems. To forecast the patterns underlying this data movement, we conduct comprehensive data-movement-centric profiling across three state-of-the-art large-scale MoE models (200B- 671B) using over 24,000 requests spanning diverse workloads. With the resulting 150GB+ trace files, we perform systematic analysis from both temporal and spatial perspectives and distill six key insights to guide the design of diverse future serving systems. Taking wafer-scale GPUs as a case study, we demonstrate that minor architectural modifications leveraging our insights achieve substantial performance gains, delivering 6.3X and 4.0X average speedups on DeepSeek V3 and Qwen3, respectively. Our work provides the first comprehensive data-centric analysis of MoE models at scale.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly becoming part of tools used by children; however, existing benchmarks fail to capture how these models manage language, reasoning, and safety needs that are specific to various ages. We present ChildSafe, a benchmark that evaluates LLM safety through simulated child agents that embody four developmental stages. These agents, grounded in developmental psychology, enable a systematic study of child safety without the ethical implications of involving real children. ChildSafe assesses responses across nine safety dimensions (including privacy, misinformation, and emotional support) using age-weighted scoring in both sensitive and neutral contexts. Multi-turn experiments with multiple LLMs uncover consistent vulnerabilities that vary by simulated age, exposing shortcomings in existing alignment practices. By releasing agent templates, evaluation protocols, and an experimental corpus, we provide a reproducible framework for age-aware safety research. We encourage the community to expand this work with real child-centered data and studies, advancing the development of LLMs that are genuinely safe and developmentally aligned.

      The exponential increase in software vulnerabilities has created an urgent need for automatic vulnerability repair (AVR) solutions. Recent research has formulated AVR as a sequence generation problem and has leveraged large language models (LLMs) to address this problem. Typically, these approaches prompt or fine-tune LLMs to generate repairs for vulnerabilities directly. Although these methods show state-of-the-art performance, they face the following challenges: (1) Lack of high-quality, vulnerability-related reasoning data. Current approaches primarily rely on foundation models that mainly encode general programming knowledge. Without vulnerability-related reasoning data, they tend to fail to capture the diverse vulnerability repair patterns. (2) Hard to verify the intermediate vulnerability repair process during LLM training. Existing reinforcement learning methods often leverage intermediate execution feedback from the environment (e.g., sandbox-based execution results) to guide reinforcement learning training. In contrast, the vulnerability repair process generally lacks such intermediate, verifiable feedback, which poses additional challenges for model training.

      Large language models (LLMs) still struggle across tasks outside of high-resource languages. In this work, we investigate cross-lingual transfer to lower-resource languages where task-specific post-training data is scarce. Building on prior work, we first validate that the subsets of model parameters that matter most for mathematical reasoning and multilingual capabilities are distinctly non-overlapping. To exploit this implicit separability between task and target language parameterization, we develop and analyze numerous modular frameworks to improve the composition of the two during fine-tuning. These methods generally employ freezing parameters or post hoc model merging to assign math and language improvement to different key parts of the LLM. In the absence of in-language math data, we demonstrate that the modular approaches successfully improve upon baselines across three languages, four models, and two fine-tuning paradigms (full and LoRA). Furthermore, we identify the most consistently successful modular method to be fine-tuning separate language and math experts and model merging via Layer-Swapping, somewhat surprisingly. We offer possible explanations for this result via recent works on the linearity of task vectors. We further explain this by empirically showing that reverting less useful fine-tuning updates after training often outperforms freezing them from the start.

      The ability to selectively remove knowledge from LLMs is highly desirable. However, existing methods often struggle with balancing unlearning efficacy and retain model utility, and lack controllability at inference time to emulate base model behavior as if it had never seen the unlearned data. In this paper, we propose LUNAR, a novel unlearning method grounded in the Linear Representation Hypothesis and operates by redirecting the representations of unlearned data to activation regions that expresses its inability to answer. We show that contrastive features are not a prerequisite for effective activation redirection, and LUNAR achieves state-of-the-art unlearning performance and superior controllability. Specifically, LUNAR achieves between 2.9x and 11.7x improvement in the combined unlearning efficacy and model utility score (Deviation Score) across various base models and generates coherent, contextually appropriate responses post-unlearning. Moreover, LUNAR effectively reduces parameter updates to a single down-projection matrix, a novel design that significantly enhances efficiency by 20x and robustness. Finally, we demonstrate that LUNAR is robust to white-box adversarial attacks and versatile in real-world scenarios, including handling sequential unlearning requests.

      Designing user-centered LLM systems requires understanding how people use them, but patterns of user behavior are often masked by the variability of queries. In this work, we introduce a new framework to describe request-making that segments user input into request content, roles assigned, query-specific context, and the remaining task-independent expressions. We apply the workflow to create and analyze a dataset of 211k real-world queries based on WildChat. Compared with similar human-human setups, we find significant differences in the language for request-making in the human-LLM scenario. Further, we introduce a novel and essential perspective of diachronic analyses with user expressions, which reveals fundamental and habitual user-LLM interaction patterns beyond individual task completion. We find that query patterns evolve from early ones emphasizing sole requests to combining more context later on, and individual users explore expression patterns but tend to converge with more experience. From there, we propose to understand communal trends of expressions underlying distinct tasks and discuss the preliminary findings. Finally, we discuss the key implications for user studies, computational pragmatics, and LLM alignment.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Attention sinks and compression valleys have attracted significant attention as two puzzling phenomena in large language models, but have been studied in isolation. In this work, we present a surprising connection between attention sinks and compression valleys, tracing both to the formation of massive activations in the residual stream. We prove theoretically that massive activations necessarily produce representational compression and establish bounds on the resulting entropy reduction. Through experiments across several models (410M-120B parameters), we confirm that when the beginning-of-sequence token develops extreme activation norms in the middle layers, both compression valleys and attention sinks emerge simultaneously. Targeted ablation studies validate our theoretical predictions. This unified view motivates us to propose the Mix-Compress-Refine theory of information flow, as an attempt to explain how LLMs organize their computation in depth by controlling attention and representational compression via massive activations. Specifically, we posit that Transformer-based LLMs process tokens in three distinct phases: (1) broad mixing in the early layers, (2) compressed computation with limited mixing in the middle layers, and (3) selective refinement in the late layers. Our framework helps explain why embedding tasks perform best at intermediate layers, whereas generation tasks benefit from full-depth processing, clarifying differences in task-dependent representations.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Controlling undesirable Large Language Model (LLM) behaviors, such as the generation of unsafe content or failing to adhere to safety guidelines, often relies on costly fine-tuning. Activation steering provides an alternative for inference-time control, but existing methods typically lack fine-grained, adaptive mechanisms. We introduce a novel approach using a lightweight, trainable controller network integrated during inference. This controller network observes specific intermediate LLM activations and predicts both a global scaling factor and layer-specific weights. The predicted global scaling factor and layer-specific weights then dynamically modulate the intensity of a steering patch, derived from a pre-computed "refusal direction" vector, applied across the LLM's layers during generation. Trained on activations from both harmful and benign prompts, our controller learns to discriminatively apply nuanced, layer-aware interventions, activating steering primarily for harmful inputs. Experiments using safety benchmarks like ToxicChat & In-The-Wild Jailbreak Prompts demonstrate that our weighted steering controller significantly increases refusal rates compared to the base LLM, achieving targeted behavioral modification without altering the original model parameters. Our experiments with Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3.2-1B & Mistral-7B show our approach outperforms existing methods, presenting an efficient and adaptive method for fine-grained control over LLM behavior at inference time.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with producing factually consistent answers due to limitations in their parametric memory. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigms mitigate this issue by incorporating external knowledge at inference time. However, such methods typically handle knowledge as unstructured text, which reduces retrieval accuracy, hinders compositional reasoning, and amplifies the influence of irrelevant information on the factual consistency of LLM outputs. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework that dynamically constructs and expands knowledge graphs (KGs) during inference, integrating both internal knowledge extracted from LLMs and external knowledge retrieved from external sources. Our method begins by extracting a seed KG from the question via prompting, followed by iterative expansion using the LLM's internal knowledge. The KG is then selectively refined through external retrieval, enhancing factual coverage and correcting inaccuracies. We evaluate our approach on three diverse Factual QA benchmarks, demonstrating consistent gains in factual accuracy over baselines. Our findings reveal that inference-time KG construction is a promising direction for enhancing LLM factuality in a structured, interpretable, and scalable manner.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently hallucinate to long-form questions, producing plausible yet factually incorrect answers. A common mitigation strategy is to provide attribution to LLM outputs. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on simple attribution that retrieves supporting textual evidence as references. We argue that in real-world scenarios such as financial applications, attribution goes beyond reference retrieval. We introduce FinLFQA, a benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of LLMs to generate long-form answers to complex financial questions with reliable and nuanced attributions. FinLFQA evaluates three critical aspects of attribution through human annotations: (1) supporting evidence extracted from financial reports, (2) intermediate numerical reasoning steps, and (3) domain-specific financial knowledge that informs the reasoning process. We further provide an automatic evaluation framework covering both answer quality and attribution quality. Through extensive experiments on eight LLMs across multiple attribution-generation paradigms, we find that fine-grained metrics are important to distinguish model capabilities, that end-to-end generation achieves comparable performance to post-hoc approaches, and that iterative refinement only helps when guided by external feedback.

      Social biases and belief-driven behaviors can significantly impact Large Language Models (LLMs) decisions on several tasks. As LLMs are increasingly used in multi-agent systems for societal simulations, their ability to model fundamental group psychological characteristics remains critical yet under-explored. In this study, we present a multi-agent framework that simulates belief congruence, a classical group psychology theory that plays a crucial role in shaping societal interactions and preferences. Our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit amplified belief congruence compared to humans, across diverse contexts. We further investigate the implications of this behavior on two downstream tasks: (1) misinformation dissemination and (2) LLM learning, finding that belief congruence in LLMs increases misinformation dissemination and impedes learning. To mitigate these negative impacts, we propose strategies inspired by: (1) contact hypothesis, (2) accuracy nudges, and (3) global citizenship framework. Our results show that the best strategies reduce misinformation dissemination by up to 37% and enhance learning by 11%.

      Virtual Labs offer valuable opportunities for hands-on, inquiry-based science learning, yet teachers often struggle to adapt them to fit their instructional goals. Third-party materials may not align with classroom needs, and developing custom resources can be time-consuming and difficult to scale. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue for addressing these limitations. In this paper, we introduce a novel alignment framework for instructional goal-aligned question generation, enabling teachers to leverage LLMs to produce simulation-aligned, pedagogically meaningful questions through natural language interaction. The framework integrates four components: instructional goal understanding via teacher-LLM dialogue, lab understanding via knowledge unit and relationship analysis, a question taxonomy for structuring cognitive and pedagogical intent, and the TELeR taxonomy for controlling prompt detail. Early design choices were informed by a small teacher-assisted case study, while our final evaluation analyzed over 1,100 questions from 19 open-source LLMs. With goal and lab understanding grounding questions in teacher intent and simulation context, the question taxonomy elevates cognitive demand (open-ended formats and relational types raise quality by 0.29-0.39 points), and optimized TELeR prompts enhance format adherence (80% parsability, >90% adherence). Larger models yield the strongest gains: parsability +37.1%, adherence +25.7%, and average quality +0.8 Likert points.

      Reasoning LLMs are trained to verbalize their reasoning process, yielding strong gains on complex tasks. This transparency also opens a promising direction: multiple reasoners can directly collaborate on each other's thinking within a shared trajectory, yielding better inference efficiency and exploration. A key prerequisite, however, is the ability to assess the usefulness and build on another model's partial thinking -- we call this off-trajectory reasoning. Our paper investigates a critical question: can standard solo-reasoning training pipelines deliver desired off-trajectory behaviors? We propose twin tests that capture the two extremes of the off-trajectory spectrum, namely Recoverability, which tests whether LLMs can backtrack from "distractions" induced by misleading reasoning traces, and Guidability, which tests their ability to build upon correct reasoning from stronger collaborators. Our study evaluates 15 open-weight LLMs (1.5B-32B) and reveals a counterintuitive finding -- "stronger" LLMs on benchmarks are often more fragile under distraction. Moreover, all models tested fail to effectively leverage guiding steps from collaborators on problems beyond their inherent capabilities with solve rates remaining under 9.2%. Finally, we conduct control studies to isolate the effects of three factors in post-training on these behaviors: the choice of distillation teacher, the use of RL, and data selection strategy. Our results provide actionable insights for training natively strong reasoning collaborators; e.g., we find that suboptimal recoverability behaviors of teacher models are transferred to distilled students even if the distillation trajectories are correct. Taken together, this work lays the groundwork for evaluating multi-model collaborations in shared reasoning trajectories and highlights the limitations of off-the-shelf reasoning LLMs.

In response, we introduce semantic regexes, structured language descriptions of LLM features. By combining primitives that capture linguistic and semantic feature patterns with modifiers for contextualization, composition, and quantification, semantic regexes produce precise and expressive feature descriptions. Across quantitative benchmarks and qualitative analyses, we find that semantic regexes match the accuracy of natural language while yielding more concise and consistent feature descriptions. Moreover, their inherent structure affords new types of analyses, including quantifying feature complexity across layers, scaling automated interpretability from insights into individual features to model-wide patterns. Finally, in user studies, we find that semantic regex descriptions help people build accurate mental models of LLM feature activations.

Thus, we define bias as deviation from a desired distribution, which may be an equal or real-world distribution, depending on application goals. We propose a weighted adaptive loss based fine-tuning method that aligns LLM's gender-profession output distribution with the desired distribution, while preserving language modeling capability. Using 3 profession sets -- male-dominated, female-dominated, and gender-balanced -- derived from U.S. labor statistics (2024), we assess both our adaptive method for reflecting reality and a non-adaptive variant for equality. Across three masked language models, bias is observed under both distributions. We achieve near-complete mitigation under equality and 30-75% reduction under real-world settings. Autoregressive LLMs show no bias under equality but notable bias under real-world settings, with the Llama Instruct models (3.2-3B, 3.1-8B) achieving a 50-62% reduction.

      Large language model (LLM) agents increasingly rely on external tools such as search engines to solve complex, multi-step problems, and reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key paradigm for training them. However, the trajectories of search agents are structurally heterogeneous, where variations in the number, placement, and outcomes of search calls lead to fundamentally different answer directions and reward distributions. Standard policy gradient methods, which use a single global baseline, suffer from what we identify and formalize as cross-stratum bias-an "apples-to-oranges" comparison of heterogeneous trajectories. This cross-stratum bias distorts credit assignment and hinders exploration of complex, multi-step search strategies. To address this, we propose Stratified GRPO, whose central component, Stratified Advantage Normalization (SAN), partitions trajectories into homogeneous strata based on their structural properties and computes advantages locally within each stratum. This ensures that trajectories are evaluated only against their true peers. Our analysis proves that SAN eliminates cross-stratum bias, yields conditionally unbiased unit-variance estimates inside each stratum, and retains the global unbiasedness and unit-variance properties enjoyed by standard normalization, resulting in a more pure and scale-stable learning signal. To improve practical stability under finite-sample regimes, we further linearly blend SAN with the global estimator. Extensive experiments on diverse single-hop and multi-hop question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that Stratified GRPO consistently and substantially outperforms GRPO by up to 11.3 points, achieving higher training rewards, greater training stability, and more effective search policies. These results establish stratification as a principled remedy for structural heterogeneity in RL for LLM search agents.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate their reasoning ability through chain-of-thought (CoT) generation. However, LLM's autoregressive decoding may limit the ability to revisit and refine earlier tokens in a holistic manner, which can also lead to inefficient exploration for diverse solutions. In this paper, we propose LaDiR (Latent Diffusion Reasoner), a novel reasoning framework that unifies the expressiveness of continuous latent representation with the iterative refinement capabilities of latent diffusion models for an existing LLM. We first construct a structured latent reasoning space using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that encodes text reasoning steps into blocks of thought tokens, preserving semantic information and interpretability while offering compact but expressive representations. Subsequently, we utilize a latent diffusion model that learns to denoise a block of latent thought tokens with a blockwise bidirectional attention mask, enabling longer horizon and iterative refinement with adaptive test-time compute. This design allows efficient parallel generation of diverse reasoning trajectories, allowing the model to plan and revise the reasoning process holistically. We conduct evaluations on a suite of mathematical reasoning and planning benchmarks. Empirical results show that LaDiR consistently improves accuracy, diversity, and interpretability over existing autoregressive, diffusion-based, and latent reasoning methods, revealing a new paradigm for text reasoning with latent diffusion.

      The Key-Value (KV) cache introduces substantial memory overhead during large language model (LLM) inference. Although existing vector quantization (VQ) methods reduce KV cache usage and provide flexible representational capacity across bit-widths, they suffer severe performance degradation at ultra-low bit-widths due to key cache outliers that hinder effective codebook utilization. To address this challenge, we propose VecInfer, a novel VQ method for aggressive KV cache compression while enabling efficient inference. By applying smooth and Hadamard transformations, VecInfer suppresses outliers in the key cache, enabling the codebook to comprehensively cover the original data distribution and thereby reducing quantization difficulty. To facilitate efficient deployment, we design an optimized CUDA kernel that fuses computation with dequantization to minimize memory access overhead. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that VecInfer consistently outperforms existing quantization baselines across both long-context understanding and mathematical reasoning tasks. With only 2-bit quantization, VecInfer achieves performance comparable to full precision, while delivering up to $\mathbf{2.7\times}$ speedup in large-batch self-attention computation and $\mathbf{8.3\times}$ reduction in single-batch end-to-end latency on Llama-3.1-8B with a 196k sequence length.

      A critical challenge in modelling Heterogeneous-Agent Teams is training agents to collaborate with teammates whose policies are inaccessible or non-stationary, such as humans. Traditional approaches rely on expensive human-in-the-loop data, which limits scalability. We propose using Large Language Models (LLMs) as policy-agnostic human proxies to generate synthetic data that mimics human decision-making. To evaluate this, we conduct three experiments in a grid-world capture game inspired by Stag Hunt, a game theory paradigm that balances risk and reward. In Experiment 1, we compare decisions from 30 human participants and 2 expert judges with outputs from LLaMA 3.1 and Mixtral 8x22B models. LLMs, prompted with game-state observations and reward structures, align more closely with experts than participants, demonstrating consistency in applying underlying decision criteria. Experiment 2 modifies prompts to induce risk-sensitive strategies (e.g. "be risk averse"). LLM outputs mirror human participants' variability, shifting between risk-averse and risk-seeking behaviours. Finally, Experiment 3 tests LLMs in a dynamic grid-world where the LLM agents generate movement actions. LLMs produce trajectories resembling human participants' paths. While LLMs cannot yet fully replicate human adaptability, their prompt-guided diversity offers a scalable foundation for simulating policy-agnostic teammates.

      LLMs are powerful generators of synthetic data, which are used for training smaller, specific models. This is especially valuable for low-resource languages, where human-labelled data is scarce but LLMs can still produce high-quality text. However, LLMs differ in how useful their outputs are for training. Selecting the best LLM as a generator is challenging because extrinsic evaluation requires costly human annotations (which are often unavailable for low-resource languages), while intrinsic metrics correlate poorly with downstream performance. We introduce Round robin Synthetic data Evaluation (RoSE), a proxy metric for selecting the best LLM generator without human test sets. RoSE trains a small model on the outputs of a candidate generator (LLM) and then evaluates it on generated synthetic examples from all other candidate LLMs. The final RoSE score is the mean performance of this small model. Across six LLMs, eleven languages, and three tasks (sentiment, topic, intent), RoSE identifies the optimal generator more often than any other intrinsic heuristics. RoSE outperforms intrinsic heuristics and comes within 0.76 percentage points of the optimal generator baseline. This result is measured in terms of downstream performance, obtained by training a small model on the chosen generator's outputs (optimal vs. proxy metric selected) and evaluating it on human-labelled test data. Additionally, RoSE is the only metric to achieve a positive correlation with performance on human test data.

      Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly shaping how information is created and disseminated, from companies using them to craft persuasive advertisements, to election campaigns optimizing messaging to gain votes, to social media influencers boosting engagement. These settings are inherently competitive, with sellers, candidates, and influencers vying for audience approval, yet it remains poorly understood how competitive feedback loops influence LLM behavior. We show that optimizing LLMs for competitive success can inadvertently drive misalignment. Using simulated environments across these scenarios, we find that, 6.3% increase in sales is accompanied by a 14.0% rise in deceptive marketing; in elections, a 4.9% gain in vote share coincides with 22.3% more disinformation and 12.5% more populist rhetoric; and on social media, a 7.5% engagement boost comes with 188.6% more disinformation and a 16.3% increase in promotion of harmful behaviors. We call this phenomenon Moloch's Bargain for AI--competitive success achieved at the cost of alignment. These misaligned behaviors emerge even when models are explicitly instructed to remain truthful and grounded, revealing the fragility of current alignment safeguards. Our findings highlight how market-driven optimization pressures can systematically erode alignment, creating a race to the bottom, and suggest that safe deployment of AI systems will require stronger governance and carefully designed incentives to prevent competitive dynamics from undermining societal trust.

      Open Source Software (OSS) has become a very important and crucial infrastructure worldwide because of the value it provides. OSS typically depends on contributions from developers across diverse backgrounds and levels of experience. Making safe changes, such as fixing a bug or implementing a new feature, can be challenging, especially in object-oriented systems where components are interdependent. Static analysis and defect-prediction tools produce metrics (e.g., complexity,coupling) that flag potentially fault-prone components, but these signals are often hard for contributors new or unfamiliar with the codebase to interpret. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on software engineering tasks such as code summarization and documentation generation. Building on this progress, we investigate whether LLMs can translate fault-prediction metrics into clear, human-readable risk explanations and actionable guidance to help OSS contributors plan and review code modifications. We outline explanation types that an LLM-generated assistant could provide (descriptive, contextual, and actionable explanations). We also outline our next steps to assess usefulness through a task-based study with OSS contributors, comparing metric-only baselines to LLM-generated explanations on decision quality, time-to-completion, and error rates

      The objectives that Large Language Models (LLMs) implicitly optimize remain dangerously opaque, making trustworthy alignment and auditing a grand challenge. While Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) can infer reward functions from behaviour, existing approaches either produce a single, overconfident reward estimate or fail to address the fundamental ambiguity of the task (non-identifiability). This paper introduces a principled auditing framework that re-frames reward inference from a simple estimation task to a comprehensive process for verification. Our framework leverages Bayesian IRL to not only recover a distribution over objectives but to enable three critical audit capabilities: (i) Quantifying and systematically reducing non-identifiability by demonstrating posterior contraction over sequential rounds of evidence; (ii) Providing actionable, uncertainty-aware diagnostics that expose spurious shortcuts and identify out-of-distribution prompts where the inferred objective cannot be trusted; and (iii) Validating policy-level utility by showing that the refined, low-uncertainty reward can be used directly in RLHF to achieve training dynamics and toxicity reductions comparable to the ground-truth alignment process. Empirically, our framework successfully audits a detoxified LLM, yielding a well-calibrated and interpretable objective that strengthens alignment guarantees. Overall, this work provides a practical toolkit for auditors, safety teams, and regulators to verify what LLMs are truly trying to achieve, moving us toward more trustworthy and accountable AI.

      As algorithmic decision-makers are increasingly applied to high-stakes domains, AI alignment research has evolved from a focus on universal value alignment to context-specific approaches that account for decision-maker attributes. Prior work on Decision-Maker Alignment (DMA) has explored two primary strategies: (1) classical AI methods integrating case-based reasoning, Bayesian reasoning, and naturalistic decision-making, and (2) large language model (LLM)-based methods leveraging prompt engineering. While both approaches have shown promise in limited domains such as medical triage, their generalizability to novel contexts remains underexplored. In this work, we implement a prior classical AI model and develop an LLM-based algorithmic decision-maker evaluated using a large reasoning model (GPT-5) and a non-reasoning model (GPT-4) with weighted self-consistency under a zero-shot prompting framework, as proposed in recent literature. We evaluate both approaches on a health insurance decision-making dataset annotated for three target decision-makers with varying levels of risk tolerance (0.0, 0.5, 1.0). In the experiments reported herein, classical AI and LLM-based models achieved comparable alignment with attribute-based targets, with classical AI exhibiting slightly better alignment for a moderate risk profile.

      Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) aligns Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences, yet the underlying reward signals they internalize remain hidden, posing a critical challenge for interpretability and safety. Existing approaches attempt to extract these latent incentives using Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), but treat all preference pairs equally, often overlooking the most informative signals: those examples the extracted reward model misclassifies or assigns nearly equal scores, which we term \emph{failures}. We introduce a novel \emph{failure-aware} IRL algorithm that focuses on misclassified or difficult examples to recover the latent rewards defining model behaviors. By learning from these failures, our failure-aware IRL extracts reward functions that better reflect the true objectives behind RLHF. We demonstrate that failure-aware IRL outperforms existing IRL baselines across multiple metrics when applied to LLM detoxification, without requiring external classifiers or supervision. Crucially, failure-aware IRL yields rewards that better capture the true incentives learned during RLHF, enabling more effective re-RLHF training than standard IRL. This establishes failure-aware IRL as a robust, scalable method for auditing model alignment and reducing ambiguity in the IRL process.

      Route recommendation aims to provide users with optimal travel plans that satisfy diverse and complex requirements. Classical routing algorithms (e.g., shortest-path and constraint-aware search) are efficient but assume structured inputs and fixed objectives, limiting adaptability to natural-language queries. Recent LLM-based approaches enhance flexibility but struggle with spatial reasoning and the joint modeling of route-level and POI-level preferences. To address these limitations, we propose RouteLLM, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that grounds natural-language intents into constraint-aware routes. It first parses user queries into structured intents including POIs, paths, and constraints. A manager agent then coordinates specialized sub-agents: a constraint agent that resolves and formally check constraints, a POI agent that retrieves and ranks candidate POIs, and a path refinement agent that refines routes via a routing engine with preference-conditioned costs. A final verifier agent ensures constraint satisfaction and produces the final route with an interpretable rationale. This design bridges linguistic flexibility and spatial structure, enabling reasoning over route feasibility and user preferences. Experiments show that our method reliably grounds textual preferences into constraint-aware routes, improving route quality and preference satisfaction over classical methods.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, Chinese LLMs face unique challenges, primarily due to the dominance of unstructured free text and the lack of structured representations in Chinese corpora. While existing benchmarks for LLMs partially assess Chinese LLMs, they are still predominantly English-centric and fail to address the unique linguistic characteristics of Chinese, lacking structured datasets essential for robust evaluation. To address these challenges, we present a Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Chinese Large Language Models (CB-ECLLM) based on the newly constructed Chinese Data-Text Pair (CDTP) dataset. Specifically, CDTP comprises over 7 million aligned text pairs, each consisting of unstructured text coupled with one or more corresponding triples, alongside a total of 15 million triples spanning four critical domains. The core contributions of CDTP are threefold: (i) enriching Chinese corpora with high-quality structured information; (ii) enabling fine-grained evaluation tailored to knowledge-driven tasks; and (iii) supporting multi-task fine-tuning to assess generalization and robustness across scenarios, including Knowledge Graph Completion, Triple-to-Text generation, and Question Answering. Furthermore, we conduct rigorous evaluations through extensive experiments and ablation studies to assess the effectiveness, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and robustness of the benchmark. To support reproducible research, we offer an open-source codebase and outline potential directions for future investigations based on our insights.

      Recent studies employing Large Language Models (LLMs) to test the Argument from the Poverty of the Stimulus (APS) have yielded contrasting results across syntactic phenomena. This paper investigates the hypothesis that characteristics of the stimuli used in recent studies, including lexical ambiguities and structural complexities, may confound model performance. A methodology is proposed for re-evaluating LLM competence on syntactic prediction, focusing on GPT-2. This involves: 1) establishing a baseline on previously used (both filtered and unfiltered) stimuli, and 2) generating a new, refined dataset using a state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview) guided by linguistically-informed templates designed to mitigate identified confounds. Our preliminary findings indicate that GPT-2 demonstrates notably improved performance on these refined PG stimuli compared to baselines, suggesting that stimulus quality significantly influences outcomes in surprisal-based evaluations of LLM syntactic competency.

Collecting and analyzing step-level annotations on the agent traces, we identify three consistent failure modes: captcha resolution, pop-up banner removal, and direct navigation to URLs. By constructing targeted datasets to further study these tasks, we discover variations in how different language models navigate these failure modes. We find, for example, that o4-mini deploys a wider variety of strategies to circumvent captcha resolution than other models and DeepSeek-R1 consistently misleads users about pop-up banner closure. Our findings surface both the diversity and brittleness of current web agents. More broadly, our benchmarking methodology provides an approach to evaluating and understanding web agent failure modes at scale.

      Recent studies probing the Argument from the Poverty of the Stimulus (APS) have applied Large Language Models (LLMs) to test the learnability of complex syntax through surprisal-based metrics. However, divergent conclusions raise questions concerning the insights these metrics offer. While Wilcox et al. (2024) used direct minimal pair comparisons (the "wh-effect") to demonstrate that models successfully generalise knowledge of filler-gap dependencies, Lan et al. (2024) used a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) metric and found that models largely fail on parasitic gaps (PGs). This paper argues that the direct minimal pair approach offers greater diagnostic transparency. We demonstrate this by generating a full 8-permutation paradigm of refined PG stimuli and evaluating the GPT-2 model used in previous studies with a systematic Wilcox-style wh-effect analysis. Our results show that GPT-2 succeeds across all four tested conditions, indicating robust knowledge of filler-gap licensing principles even in complex PG environments. This finding, which contrasts with the more ambiguous results from DiD-style metrics, suggests that the choice of evaluation metric is critical for assessing an LLM's syntactic competence.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to complex tasks that require extended reasoning. In such settings, models often benefit from diverse chains-of-thought to arrive at multiple candidate solutions. This requires two competing objectives: to inject enough stochasticity to explore multiple reasoning chains, and to ensure sufficient accuracy and quality in each path. Existing works pursue the first objective by increasing exploration at highly uncertain steps with higher temperature or larger candidate token sets, while others improve reliability by rejecting samples with low confidence post-generation, implying that low confidence correlates with low answer quality. These two lines of thought are in conflict, as they conflate different sources of uncertainty. To resolve this, we argue that the decoding rule should be calibrated by correctness, not confidence alone. We should sample from tokens with higher estimated correctness, and reduce sampling where expected correctness is low. We propose simple strategies that achieve this goal: Greedy-Threshold makes sampling greedy at very low confidence steps. Calibrated-TopK and Calibrated-epsilon set truncation threshold based on estimated rank-wise correctness. Together, our findings challenge prevailing heuristics about decoding under uncertainty and show gains across math and general reasoning benchmarks.

      Time series classification (TSC) spans diverse application scenarios, yet labeled data are often scarce, making task-specific training costly and inflexible. Recent reasoning-oriented large language models (LLMs) show promise in understanding temporal patterns, but purely zero-shot usage remains suboptimal. We propose FETA, a multi-agent framework for training-free TSC via exemplar-based in-context reasoning. FETA decomposes a multivariate series into channel-wise subproblems, retrieves a few structurally similar labeled examples for each channel, and leverages a reasoning LLM to compare the query against these exemplars, producing channel-level labels with self-assessed confidences; a confidence-weighted aggregator then fuses all channel decisions. This design eliminates the need for pretraining or fine-tuning, improves efficiency by pruning irrelevant channels and controlling input length, and enhances interpretability through exemplar grounding and confidence estimation. On nine challenging UEA datasets, FETA achieves strong accuracy under a fully training-free setting, surpassing multiple trained baselines. These results demonstrate that a multi-agent in-context reasoning framework can transform LLMs into competitive, plug-and-play TSC solvers without any parameter training.

      Recent studies have investigated whether large language models (LLMs) can support obscured communication, which is characterized by core aspects such as inferring subtext and evading suspicions. To conduct the investigation, researchers have used social deduction games (SDGs) as their experimental environment, in which players conceal and infer specific information. However, prior work has often overlooked how LLMs should be evaluated in such settings. Specifically, we point out two limitations with the evaluation methods they employed. First, metrics used in prior studies are coarse-grained as they are based on overall game outcomes that often fail to capture event-level behaviors; Second, error analyses have lacked structured methodologies capable of producing insights that meaningfully support evaluation outcomes. To address these limitations, we propose a microscopic and systematic approach to the investigation. Specifically, we introduce six fine-grained metrics that resolve the first issue. To tackle the second issue, we conducted a thematic analysis and identified four major reasoning failures that undermine LLMs' performance in obscured communication.

      High-dimensional data remains a pervasive challenge in machine learning, often undermining model interpretability and computational efficiency. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise for dimensionality reduction through feature selection, existing LLM-based approaches frequently lack structured reasoning and transparent justification for their decisions. This paper introduces LLM-FS-Agent, a novel multi-agent architecture designed for interpretable and robust feature selection. The system orchestrates a deliberative "debate" among multiple LLM agents, each assigned a specific role, enabling collective evaluation of feature relevance and generation of detailed justifications. We evaluate LLM-FS-Agent in the cybersecurity domain using the CIC-DIAD 2024 IoT intrusion detection dataset and compare its performance against strong baselines, including LLM-Select and traditional methods such as PCA. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-FS-Agent consistently achieves superior or comparable classification performance while reducing downstream training time by an average of 46% (statistically significant improvement, p = 0.028 for XGBoost). These findings highlight that the proposed deliberative architecture enhances both decision transparency and computational efficiency, establishing LLM-FS-Agent as a practical and reliable solution for real-world applications.

      As Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities learned from vast corpora, concerns regarding data privacy and safety are receiving increasing attention. LLM unlearning, which aims to remove the influence of specific data while preserving overall model utility, is becoming an important research area. One of the mainstream unlearning classes is optimization-based methods, which achieve forgetting directly through fine-tuning, exemplified by Negative Preference Optimization (NPO). However, NPO's effectiveness is limited by its inherent lack of explicit positive preference signals. Attempts to introduce such signals by constructing preferred responses often necessitate domain-specific knowledge or well-designed prompts, fundamentally restricting their generalizability. In this paper, we shift the focus to the distribution-level, directly targeting the next-token probability distribution instead of entire responses, and derive a novel unlearning algorithm termed \textbf{Di}stribution \textbf{P}reference \textbf{O}ptimization (DiPO). We show that the requisite preference distribution pairs for DiPO, which are distributions over the model's output tokens, can be constructed by selectively amplifying or suppressing the model's high-confidence output logits, thereby effectively overcoming NPO's limitations. We theoretically prove the consistency of DiPO's loss function with the desired unlearning direction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiPO achieves a strong trade-off between model utility and forget quality. Notably, DiPO attains the highest forget quality on the TOFU benchmark, and maintains leading scalability and sustainability in utility preservation on the MUSE benchmark.

      Padding tokens are widely used in large language models (LLMs) to equalize sequence lengths during batched inference. While they should be fully masked, implementation errors can cause them to influence computation, and the extent of this influence is not well understood. We systematically study this effect across three open-source model families (Llama, Gemma, Qwen), inserting controlled amounts of padding and evaluating outcomes along four axes: activations, generation quality, bias, and safety. Even small amounts of padding shift hidden representations, degrade quality in smaller models, alter bias in unpredictable ways, and weaken safety guardrails. These findings demonstrate that padding is not a harmless detail but a robustness risk that must be carefully handled in deployment.

      While most autoregressive LLMs are constrained to one-by-one decoding, diffusion LLMs (dLLMs) have attracted growing interest for their potential to dramatically accelerate inference through parallel decoding. Despite this promise, the conditional independence assumption in dLLMs causes parallel decoding to ignore token dependencies, inevitably degrading generation quality when these dependencies are strong. However, existing works largely overlook these inherent challenges, and evaluations on standard benchmarks (e.g., math and coding) are not sufficient to capture the quality degradation caused by parallel decoding. To address this gap, we first provide an information-theoretic analysis of parallel decoding. We then conduct case studies on analytically tractable synthetic list operations from both data distribution and decoding strategy perspectives, offering quantitative insights that highlight the fundamental limitations of parallel decoding. Building on these insights, we propose ParallelBench, the first benchmark specifically designed for dLLMs, featuring realistic tasks that are trivial for humans and autoregressive LLMs yet exceptionally challenging for dLLMs under parallel decoding. Using ParallelBench, we systematically analyze both dLLMs and autoregressive LLMs, revealing that: (i) dLLMs under parallel decoding can suffer dramatic quality degradation in real-world scenarios, and (ii) current parallel decoding strategies struggle to adapt their degree of parallelism based on task difficulty, thus failing to achieve meaningful speedup without compromising quality. Our findings underscore the pressing need for innovative decoding methods that can overcome the current speed-quality trade-off. We release our benchmark to help accelerate the development of truly efficient dLLMs.

We also find that the performances in such language exams can be used to predict performances in other NLP tasks in Luxembourgish.

      The increasing volume of scholarly publications requires advanced tools for efficient knowledge discovery and management. This paper introduces ongoing work on a system using Large Language Models (LLMs) for the semantic extraction of key concepts from scientific documents. Our research, conducted within the German National Research Data Infrastructure for and with Computer Science (NFDIxCS) project, seeks to support FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles in scientific publishing. We outline our explorative work, which uses in-context learning with various LLMs to extract concepts from papers, initially focusing on the Business Process Management (BPM) domain. A key advantage of this approach is its potential for rapid domain adaptation, often requiring few or even zero examples to define extraction targets for new scientific fields. We conducted technical evaluations to compare the performance of commercial and open-source LLMs and created an online demo application to collect feedback from an initial user-study. Additionally, we gathered insights from the computer science research community through user stories collected during a dedicated workshop, actively guiding the ongoing development of our future services. These services aim to support structured literature reviews, concept-based information retrieval, and integration of extracted knowledge into existing knowledge graphs.

      We introduce FloorplanQA, a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating spatial reasoning in large-language models (LLMs). FloorplanQA is grounded in structured representations of indoor scenes, such as (e.g., kitchens, living rooms, bedrooms, bathrooms, and others), encoded symbolically in JSON or XML layouts. The benchmark covers core spatial tasks, including distance measurement, visibility, path finding, and object placement within constrained spaces. Our results across a variety of frontier open-source and commercial LLMs reveal that while models may succeed in shallow queries, they often fail to respect physical constraints, preserve spatial coherence, though they remain mostly robust to small spatial perturbations. FloorplanQA uncovers a blind spot in today's LLMs: inconsistent reasoning about indoor layouts. We hope this benchmark inspires new work on language models that can accurately infer and manipulate spatial and geometric properties in practical settings.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong performance on mathematical benchmarks. At the same time, they are prone to hallucination and sycophancy, often providing convincing but flawed proofs for incorrect mathematical statements provided by users. This significantly limits the applicability of LLMs in theorem proving, as verification of these flawed proofs must be done manually by expert mathematicians. However, existing benchmarks that measure sycophancy in mathematics are limited: they focus solely on final-answer problems, rely on very simple and often contaminated datasets, and construct benchmark samples using synthetic modifications that create ill-posed questions rather than well-posed questions that are demonstrably false. To address these issues, we introduce BrokenMath, the first benchmark for evaluating sycophantic behavior in LLMs within the context of natural language theorem proving. BrokenMath is built from advanced 2025 competition problems, which are perturbed with an LLM to produce false statements and subsequently refined through expert review. Using an LLM-as-a-judge framework, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs and agentic systems and find that sycophancy is widespread, with the best model, GPT-5, producing sycophantic answers 29% of the time. We further investigate several mitigation strategies, including test-time interventions and supervised fine-tuning on curated sycophantic examples. These approaches substantially reduce, but do not eliminate, sycophantic behavior.

      Large language models (LLMs) can modify JSON documents through natural language commands, but current approaches regenerate entire structures for each edit, resulting in computational inefficiency. We present JSON Whisperer, a framework that enables LLMs to generate RFC 6902 diff patches-expressing only the necessary modifications-rather than complete documents. We identify two key challenges in patch-based editing: (1) LLMs often miss related updates when generating isolated patches, and (2) array manipulations require tracking index shifts across operations, which LLMs handle poorly. To address these issues, we introduce EASE (Explicitly Addressed Sequence Encoding), which transforms arrays into dictionaries with stable keys, eliminating index arithmetic complexities. Our evaluation shows that patch generation with EASE reduces token usage by 31% while maintaining edit quality within 5% of full regeneration with particular gains for complex instructions and list manipulations.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Enabling large language models (LLMs) to utilize search tools offers a promising path to overcoming fundamental limitations such as knowledge cutoffs and hallucinations. Recent work has explored reinforcement learning (RL) for training search-augmented agents that interleave reasoning and retrieval before answering. These approaches usually rely on outcome-based rewards (e.g., exact match), implicitly assuming that optimizing for final answers will also yield effective intermediate search behaviors. Our analysis challenges this assumption: we uncover multiple systematic deficiencies in search that arise under outcome-only training and ultimately degrade final answer quality, including failure to invoke tools, invalid queries, and redundant searches. To address these shortcomings, we introduce DeSA (Decoupling Search-and-Answering), a simple two-stage training framework that explicitly separates search optimization from answer generation. In Stage 1, agents are trained to improve search effectiveness with retrieval recall-based rewards. In Stage 2, outcome rewards are employed to optimize final answer generation. Across seven QA benchmarks, DeSA-trained agents consistently improve search behaviors, delivering substantially higher search recall and answer accuracy than outcome-only baselines. Notably, DeSA outperforms single-stage training approaches that simultaneously optimize recall and outcome rewards, underscoring the necessity of explicitly decoupling the two objectives.

      Large-scale web-scraped text corpora used to train general-purpose AI models often contain harmful demographic-targeted social biases, creating a regulatory need for data auditing and developing scalable bias-detection methods. Although prior work has investigated biases in text datasets and related detection methods, these studies remain narrow in scope. They typically focus on a single content type (e.g., hate speech), cover limited demographic axes, overlook biases affecting multiple demographics simultaneously, and analyze limited techniques. Consequently, practitioners lack a holistic understanding of the strengths and limitations of recent large language models (LLMs) for automated bias detection. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework aimed at English texts to assess the ability of LLMs in detecting demographic-targeted social biases. To align with regulatory requirements, we frame bias detection as a multi-label task using a demographic-focused taxonomy. We then conduct a systematic evaluation with models across scales and techniques, including prompting, in-context learning, and fine-tuning. Using twelve datasets spanning diverse content types and demographics, our study demonstrates the promise of fine-tuned smaller models for scalable detection. However, our analyses also expose persistent gaps across demographic axes and multi-demographic targeted biases, underscoring the need for more effective and scalable auditing frameworks.

In this framework, we develop an agentic system driven by a Large Language Model (LLM) to direct the conversation flow and determine appropriate interactive behaviors for both participants. Additionally, we propose a novel dual-person gesture generation model based on an auto-regressive diffusion model, which synthesizes coordinated motions from speech signals. The output of the agentic system is translated into high-level guidance for the gesture generator, resulting in realistic movement at both the behavioral and motion levels. Furthermore, the agentic system periodically examines the movements of interlocutors and infers their intentions, forming a continuous feedback loop that enables dynamic and responsive interactions between the two participants. User studies and quantitative evaluations show that our model significantly improves the quality of dyadic interactions, producing natural, synchronized nonverbal behaviors.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Large language model (LLM) agents typically receive two kinds of context: (i) environment-level manuals that define interaction interfaces and global rules, and (ii) task-level guidance or demonstrations tied to specific goals. In this work, we identify a crucial but overlooked third type of context, instance-level context, which consists of verifiable and reusable facts tied to a specific environment instance, such as object locations, crafting recipes, and local rules. We argue that the absence of instance-level context is a common source of failure for LLM agents in complex tasks, as success often depends not only on reasoning over global rules or task prompts but also on making decisions based on precise and persistent facts. Acquiring such context requires more than memorization: the challenge lies in efficiently exploring, validating, and formatting these facts under tight interaction budgets. We formalize this problem as Instance-Level Context Learning (ILCL) and introduce our task-agnostic method to solve it. Our method performs a guided exploration, using a compact TODO forest to intelligently prioritize its next actions and a lightweight plan-act-extract loop to execute them. This process automatically produces a high-precision context document that is reusable across many downstream tasks and agents, thereby amortizing the initial exploration cost. Experiments across TextWorld, ALFWorld, and Crafter demonstrate consistent gains in both success and efficiency: for instance, ReAct's mean success rate in TextWorld rises from 37% to 95%, while IGE improves from 81% to 95%. By transforming one-off exploration into persistent, reusable knowledge, our method complements existing contexts to enable more reliable and efficient LLM agents.

      The unjudged document problem, where pooled test collections have incomplete relevance judgments for evaluating new retrieval systems, is a key obstacle to the reusability of test collections in information retrieval. While the de facto standard to deal with the problem is to treat unjudged documents as non-relevant, many alternatives have been proposed, including the use of large language models (LLMs) as a relevance judge (LLM-as-a-judge). However, this has been criticized as circular, since the same LLM can be used as a judge and as a ranker at the same time. We propose to train topic-specific relevance classifiers instead: By finetuning monoT5 with independent LoRA weight adaptation on the judgments of a single assessor for a single topic's pool, we align it to that assessor's notion of relevance for the topic. The system rankings obtained through our classifier's relevance judgments achieve a Spearmans' $\rho$ correlation of $>0.95$ with ground truth system rankings. As little as 128 initial human judgments per topic suffice to improve the comparability of models, compared to treating unjudged documents as non-relevant, while achieving more reliability than existing LLM-as-a-judge approaches. Topic-specific relevance classifiers thus are a lightweight and straightforward way to tackle the unjudged document problem, while maintaining human judgments as the gold standard for retrieval evaluation.

      Although large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing capabilities, their practical implementation as autonomous multi-agent systems (MAS) for industrial problem-solving encounters persistent barriers. Conventional MAS architectures are fundamentally restricted by inflexible, hand-crafted graph topologies that lack contextual responsiveness, resulting in diminished efficacy across varied academic and commercial workloads. To surmount these constraints, we introduce AMAS, a paradigm-shifting framework that redefines LLM-based MAS through a novel dynamic graph designer. This component autonomously identifies task-specific optimal graph configurations via lightweight LLM adaptation, eliminating the reliance on monolithic, universally applied structural templates. Instead, AMAS exploits the intrinsic properties of individual inputs to intelligently direct query trajectories through task-optimized agent pathways. Rigorous validation across question answering, mathematical deduction, and code generation benchmarks confirms that AMAS systematically exceeds state-of-the-art single-agent and multi-agent approaches across diverse LLM architectures. Our investigation establishes that context-sensitive structural adaptability constitutes a foundational requirement for high-performance LLM MAS deployments.

      Computer-use agents (CUAs) powered by large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising approach to automating computer tasks, yet they struggle with graphical user interfaces (GUIs). GUIs, designed for humans, force LLMs to decompose high-level goals into lengthy, error-prone sequences of fine-grained actions, resulting in low success rates and an excessive number of LLM calls. We propose Goal-Oriented Interface (GOI), a novel abstraction that transforms existing GUIs into three declarative primitives: access, state, and observation, which are better suited for LLMs. Our key idea is policy-mechanism separation: LLMs focus on high-level semantic planning (policy) while GOI handles low-level navigation and interaction (mechanism). GOI does not require modifying the application source code or relying on application programming interfaces (APIs). We evaluate GOI with Microsoft Office Suite (Word, PowerPoint, Excel) on Windows. Compared to a leading GUI-based agent baseline, GOI improves task success rates by 67% and reduces interaction steps by 43.5%. Notably, GOI completes over 61% of successful tasks with a single LLM call.

While prior work has studied property inference attacks on discriminative models (e.g., image classification models) and generative models (e.g., GANs for image data), it remains unclear if such attacks transfer to LLMs. In this work, we introduce PropInfer, a benchmark task for evaluating property inference in LLMs under two fine-tuning paradigms: question-answering and chat-completion. Built on the ChatDoctor dataset, our benchmark includes a range of property types and task configurations. We further propose two tailored attacks: a prompt-based generation attack and a shadow-model attack leveraging word frequency signals. Empirical evaluations across multiple pretrained LLMs show the success of our attacks, revealing a previously unrecognized vulnerability in LLMs.

We ask the following research questions: (1) Do LLMs exhibit human-like preferences in representing plural reference? (2) Are LLMs able to detect ambiguity in plural anaphoric expressions and identify possible referents? To address these questions, we design a set of experiments, examining pronoun production using next-token prediction tasks, pronoun interpretation, and ambiguity detection using different prompting strategies. We then assess how comparable LLMs are to humans in formulating and interpreting plural reference. We find that LLMs are sometimes aware of possible referents of ambiguous pronouns. However, they do not always follow human reference when choosing between interpretations, especially when the possible interpretation is not explicitly mentioned. In addition, they struggle to identify ambiguity without direct instruction. Our findings also reveal inconsistencies in the results across different types of experiments.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate their reasoning ability through chain-of-thought (CoT) generation. However, LLM's autoregressive decoding may limit the ability to revisit and refine earlier tokens in a holistic manner, which can also lead to inefficient exploration for diverse solutions. In this paper, we propose LaDiR (Latent Diffusion Reasoner), a novel reasoning framework that unifies the expressiveness of continuous latent representation with the iterative refinement capabilities of latent diffusion models for an existing LLM. We first construct a structured latent reasoning space using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that encodes text reasoning steps into blocks of thought tokens, preserving semantic information and interpretability while offering compact but expressive representations. Subsequently, we utilize a latent diffusion model that learns to denoise a block of latent thought tokens with a blockwise bidirectional attention mask, enabling longer horizon and iterative refinement with adaptive test-time compute. This design allows efficient parallel generation of diverse reasoning trajectories, allowing the model to plan and revise the reasoning process holistically. We conduct evaluations on a suite of mathematical reasoning and planning benchmarks. Empirical results show that LaDiR consistently improves accuracy, diversity, and interpretability over existing autoregressive, diffusion-based, and latent reasoning methods, revealing a new paradigm for text reasoning with latent diffusion.

      Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for precessing relational data but often struggle to generalize to unseen graphs, giving rise to the development of Graph Foundational Models (GFMs). However, current GFMs are challenged by the extreme heterogeneity of graph data, where each graph can possess a unique feature space, label set, and topology. To address this, two main paradigms have emerged. The first leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), but is fundamentally text-dependent, thus struggles to handle the numerical features in vast graphs. The second pre-trains a structure-based model, but the adaptation to new tasks typically requires a costly, per-graph tuning stage, creating a critical efficiency bottleneck. In this work, we move beyond these limitations and introduce \textbf{G}raph \textbf{I}n-context \textbf{L}earning \textbf{T}ransformer (GILT), a framework built on an LLM-free and tuning-free architecture. GILT introduces a novel token-based framework for in-context learning (ICL) on graphs, reframing classification tasks spanning node, edge and graph levels in a unified framework. This mechanism is the key to handling heterogeneity, as it is designed to operate on generic numerical features. Further, its ability to understand class semantics dynamically from the context enables tuning-free adaptation. Comprehensive experiments show that GILT achieves stronger few-shot performance with significantly less time than LLM-based or tuning-based baselines, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

For 3D-CG generation support, 3Dify automates the operation of various Digital Content Creation (DCC) tools via MCP. When DCC tools do not support MCP-based interaction, the framework employs the Computer-Using Agent (CUA) method to automate Graphical User Interface (GUI) operations. Moreover, to enhance image generation quality, 3Dify allows users to provide feedback by selecting preferred images from multiple candidates. The LLM then learns variable patterns from these selections and applies them to subsequent generations. Furthermore, 3Dify supports the integration of locally deployed LLMs, enabling users to utilize custom-developed models and to reduce both time and monetary costs associated with external API calls by leveraging their own computational resources.

      Multi-objective discrete optimization problems, such as molecular design, pose significant challenges due to their vast and unstructured combinatorial spaces. Traditional evolutionary algorithms often get trapped in local optima, while expert knowledge can provide crucial guidance for accelerating convergence. Large language models (LLMs) offer powerful priors and reasoning ability, making them natural optimizers when expert knowledge matters. However, closed-source LLMs, though strong in exploration, cannot update their parameters and thus cannot internalize experience. Conversely, smaller open models can be continually fine-tuned but lack broad knowledge and reasoning strength. We introduce Multi-LLM Collaborative Co-evolution (MCCE), a hybrid framework that unites a frozen closed-source LLM with a lightweight trainable model. The system maintains a trajectory memory of past search processes; the small model is progressively refined via reinforcement learning, with the two models jointly supporting and complementing each other in global exploration. Unlike model distillation, this process enhances the capabilities of both models through mutual inspiration. Experiments on multi-objective drug design benchmarks show that MCCE achieves state-of-the-art Pareto front quality and consistently outperforms baselines. These results highlight a new paradigm for enabling continual evolution in hybrid LLM systems, combining knowledge-driven exploration with experience-driven learning.

      During fine-tuning, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly vulnerable to data-poisoning backdoor attacks, which compromise their reliability and trustworthiness. However, existing defense strategies suffer from limited generalization: they only work on specific attack types or task settings. In this study, we propose Poison-to-Poison (P2P), a general and effective backdoor defense algorithm. P2P injects benign triggers with safe alternative labels into a subset of training samples and fine-tunes the model on this re-poisoned dataset by leveraging prompt-based learning. This enforces the model to associate trigger-induced representations with safe outputs, thereby overriding the effects of original malicious triggers. Thanks to this robust and generalizable trigger-based fine-tuning, P2P is effective across task settings and attack types. Theoretically and empirically, we show that P2P can neutralize malicious backdoors while preserving task performance. We conduct extensive experiments on classification, mathematical reasoning, and summary generation tasks, involving multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. The results demonstrate that our P2P algorithm significantly reduces the attack success rate compared with baseline models. We hope that the P2P can serve as a guideline for defending against backdoor attacks and foster the development of a secure and trustworthy LLM community.

      Inference scaling methods for LLMs often rely on decomposing problems into steps (or groups of tokens), followed by sampling and selecting the best next steps. However, these steps and their sizes are often predetermined or manually designed based on domain knowledge. We propose dynamic decomposition, a method that adaptively and automatically partitions solution and reasoning traces into manageable steps during inference. By more effectively allocating compute -- particularly through subdividing challenging steps and prioritizing their sampling -- dynamic decomposition significantly improves inference efficiency. Experiments on benchmarks such as APPS, MATH, and LiveCodeBench demonstrate that dynamic decomposition outperforms static approaches, including token-level, sentence-level, and single-step decompositions, reducing the pass@10 error rate by 5.0%, 6.7%, and 10.5% respectively. These findings highlight the potential of dynamic decomposition to improve a wide range of inference scaling techniques.
