      This paper introduces a novel self-consciousness defense mechanism for Large Language Models (LLMs) to combat prompt injection attacks. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on external classifiers, our method leverages the LLM's inherent reasoning capabilities to perform self-protection. We propose a framework that incorporates Meta-Cognitive and Arbitration Modules, enabling LLMs to evaluate and regulate their own outputs autonomously. Our approach is evaluated on seven state-of-the-art LLMs using two datasets: AdvBench and Prompt-Injection-Mixed-Techniques-2024. Experiment results demonstrate significant improvements in defense success rates across models and datasets, with some achieving perfect and near-perfect defense in Enhanced Mode. We also analyze the trade-off between defense success rate improvement and computational overhead. This self-consciousness method offers a lightweight, cost-effective solution for enhancing LLM ethics, particularly beneficial for GenAI use cases across various platforms.

      Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by using a smaller draft model to speculate tokens that a larger target model verifies. Verification is often the bottleneck (e.g. verification is $4\times$ slower than token generation when a 3B model speculates for a 70B target model), but most prior works focus only on accelerating drafting. $\textit{``Intermediate"}$ verification reduces verification time by discarding inaccurate draft tokens early, but existing methods incur substantial training overheads in incorporating the intermediate verifier, increase the memory footprint to orchestrate the intermediate verification step, and compromise accuracy by relying on approximate heuristics. We propose $\underline{\textit{Hi}}\textit{erarchical }\underline{\textit{Spec}}\textit{ulative Decoding (HiSpec)}$, a framework for high-throughput speculative decoding that exploits $\textit{early-exit (EE) models}$ for low-overhead intermediate verification. EE models allow tokens to exit early by skipping layer traversal and are explicitly trained so that hidden states at selected layers can be interpreted, making them uniquely suited for intermediate verification without drastically increasing compute and memory overheads. To improve resource-efficiency even further, we design a methodology that enables HiSpec to re-use key-value caches and hidden states between the draft, intermediate verifier, and target models. To maintain accuracy, HiSpec periodically validates the draft tokens accepted by the intermediate verifier against the target model. Our evaluations using various representative benchmarks and models show that HiSpec improves throughput by 1.28$\times$ on average and by up to 2.01$\times$ compared to the baseline single-layer speculation without compromising accuracy.

      The full-size MLPs and the projection layers in attention introduce tremendous model sizes of large language models (LLMs), consuming extensive computational resources in pre-training. We empirically observe that the activations of pre-trained LLMs exhibit low-rank property. Motivated by such observations, we propose CoLA and its memory-efficient implementation, CoLA-M, to replace these full-size layers with compute-efficient auto-encoders that naturally enforce low-rank activations throughout training. This fundamental architectural change eliminates the activation redundancy and significantly boosts model capacity and training efficiency. Experiments on LLaMA models with 60 million to 7 billion parameters show that CoLA reduces the computing cost by $\bf 2\pmb{\times}$ and improves training throughput by $\bf 1.86\pmb{\times}$ while maintaining full-rank level performance. CoLA-M further squeezes memory cost without sacrificing throughput, offering a pre-training approach with collectively superior parameter, computing, and memory efficiency. The LLMs produced are also $\bf 2\pmb{\times}$ smaller, enabling faster inference with lower memory cost on resource-constrained platforms.
