      Curriculum learning plays a crucial role in enhancing the training efficiency of large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks. However, existing methods often fail to adequately account for variations in prompt difficulty or rely on simplistic filtering mechanisms to select prompt datasets within a narrow criterion range, resulting in significant computational waste. In this work, we approach the problem from the perspective of reinforcement learning gradient optimization, offering a systematic and theoretical investigation into how to improve the training efficiency of LLMs. We identify two key factors influencing training efficiency: the selection of training prompts and the allocation of rollout quantities across different prompts. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the sampling distribution of prompts dictates the convergence rate of gradient descent, while the allocation of the rollout quantity influences the consistency and stability of overall gradient updates. Based on these insights, we propose CurES, an efficient training method that accelerates convergence and employs Bayesian posterior estimation to minimize computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that our CurES outperforms Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) by \textbf{+3.30} points and \textbf{+4.82} points with 1.5B and 7B models, respectively. Additionally, CurES exhibits faster convergence compared to baselines, including GRPO.

      Motivated by the puzzling observation that inserting long sequences of meaningless tokens before the query prompt can consistently enhance LLM reasoning performance, this work analyzes the underlying mechanism driving this phenomenon and based on these insights proposes a more principled method that allows for similar performance gains. First, we find that the improvements arise from a redistribution of activations in the LLM's MLP layers, where near zero activations become less frequent while large magnitude activations increase. This redistribution enhances the model's representational capacity by suppressing weak signals and promoting stronger, more informative ones. Building on this insight, we propose the Activation Redistribution Module (ARM), a lightweight inference-time technique that modifies activations directly without altering the input sequence. ARM adaptively identifies near-zero activations after the non-linear function and shifts them outward, implicitly reproducing the beneficial effects of meaningless tokens in a controlled manner. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and model architectures clearly show that ARM consistently improves LLM performance on reasoning tasks while requiring only a few lines of simple code to implement. Our findings deliver both a clear mechanistic explanation for the unexpected benefits of meaningless tokens and a simple yet effective technique that harnesses activation redistribution to further improve LLM performance.

      The ability to translate diverse patterns of inputs into structured patterns of behavior has been thought to rest on both humans' and machines' ability to learn robust representations of relevant concepts. The rapid advancement of transformer-based large language models (LLMs) has led to a diversity of computational ingredients -- architectures, fine tuning methods, and training datasets among others -- but it remains unclear which of these ingredients are most crucial for building models that develop human-like representations. Further, most current LLM benchmarks are not suited to measuring representational alignment between humans and models, making benchmark scores unreliable for assessing if current LLMs are making progress towards becoming useful cognitive models. We address these limitations by first evaluating a set of over 70 models that widely vary in their computational ingredients on a triplet similarity task, a method well established in the cognitive sciences for measuring human conceptual representations, using concepts from the THINGS database. Comparing human and model representations, we find that models that undergo instruction-finetuning and which have larger dimensionality of attention heads are among the most human aligned, while multimodal pretraining and parameter size have limited bearing on alignment. Correlations between alignment scores and scores on existing benchmarks reveal that while some benchmarks (e.g., MMLU) are better suited than others (e.g., MUSR) for capturing representational alignment, no existing benchmark is capable of fully accounting for the variance of alignment scores, demonstrating their insufficiency in capturing human-AI alignment. Taken together, our findings help highlight the computational ingredients most essential for advancing LLMs towards models of human conceptual representation and address a key benchmarking gap in LLM evaluation.

      Designing and optimizing task-specific quantum circuits are crucial to leverage the advantage of quantum computing. Recent large language model (LLM)-based quantum circuit generation has emerged as a promising automatic solution. However, the fundamental challenges remain unaddressed: (i) parameterized quantum gates require precise numerical values for optimal performance, which also depend on multiple aspects, including the number of quantum gates, their parameters, and the layout/depth of the circuits. (ii) LLMs often generate low-quality or incorrect quantum circuits due to the lack of quantum domain-specific knowledge. We propose QUASAR, an agentic reinforcement learning (RL) framework for quantum circuits generation and optimization based on tool-augmented LLMs. To align the LLM with quantum-specific knowledge and improve the generated quantum circuits, QUASAR designs (i) a quantum circuit verification approach with external quantum simulators and (ii) a sophisticated hierarchical reward mechanism in RL training. Extensive evaluation shows improvements in both syntax and semantic performance of the generated quantum circuits. When augmenting a 4B LLM, QUASAR has achieved the validity of 99.31% in Pass@1 and 100% in Pass@10, outperforming industrial LLMs of GPT-4o, GPT-5 and DeepSeek-V3 and several supervised-fine-tuning (SFT)-only and RL-only baselines.

      Large language models (LLMs) are ubiquitous in modern day natural language processing. However, previous work has shown degraded LLM performance for under-represented English dialects. We analyze the effects of typifying "standard" American English language questions as non-"standard" dialectal variants on multiple choice question answering tasks and find up to a 20% reduction in accuracy. Additionally, we investigate the grammatical basis of under-performance in non-"standard" English questions. We find that individual grammatical rules have varied effects on performance, but some are more consequential than others: three specific grammar rules (existential "it", zero copula, and y'all) can explain the majority of performance degradation observed in multiple dialects. We call for future work to investigate bias mitigation methods focused on individual, high-impact grammatical structures.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for automated code optimization but struggle without performance context. This work introduces Opal, a modular framework that connects performance analytics insights with the vast body of published by guiding LLMs to generate informed, trustworthy optimizations. Unlike traditional performance tools that identify bottlenecks but stop short of actionable suggestions, Opal bridges this long-standing gap by linking dynamic insights from hardware counters and Roofline analysis to stall events to optimization decisions. We evaluate Opal across 1640 experiments on real-world GPU kernels and find that in over 98.5% of cases, even a single insight source yields speedups, ranging on average from 19.34% to 52.3%. Our prompt template produced correct code in all but one case, where a vague diagnostic caused an unsafe suggestion. By automatically optimizing GPU kernels using performance analytics and LLMs, Opal marks a leap toward democratizing expert-level performance engineering for all.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Reinforcement learning with verifiable reward has recently emerged as a central paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs); however, prevailing mean-based methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), suffer from entropy collapse and limited reasoning gains. We argue that these issues stem from overemphasizing high-probability output sequences while neglecting rare but informative reasoning paths. To address these challenges, we propose Risk-based Policy Optimization (RiskPO), which substitutes classical mean-based objectives with principled risk measures. Specifically, we introduce a Mixed Value-at-Risk objective that integrates weighted attention over multiple regions of the reward distribution, thereby amplifying gradient signals on challenging instances and preventing overconfident convergence. We further design a bundling scheme that aggregates multiple questions into bundles, thus enriching the feedback signal and yielding more stable and informative training dynamics. Theoretically, we prove that the risk-averse update alleviates entropy collapse and promotes exploration. Numerically, RiskPO achieves consistent and significant improvements in mathematical reasoning, multi-modal reasoning, and code generation benchmarks, surpassing GRPO and its variants on both Pass@1 and Pass@k metrics. Our results demonstrate that risk-based optimization provides a rigorous and effective paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

      Cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) addresses the challenge of retrieving relevant documents written in languages different from that of the original query. Research in this area has typically framed the task as monolingual retrieval augmented by translation, treating retrieval methods and cross-lingual capabilities in isolation. Both monolingual and cross-lingual retrieval usually follow a pipeline of query expansion, ranking, re-ranking and, increasingly, question answering. Recent advances, however, have shifted from translation-based methods toward embedding-based approaches and leverage multilingual large language models (LLMs), for which aligning representations across languages remains a central challenge. The emergence of cross-lingual embeddings and multilingual LLMs has introduced a new paradigm, offering improved retrieval performance and enabling answer generation. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of developments from early translation-based methods to state-of-the-art embedding-driven and generative techniques. It presents a structured account of core CLIR components, evaluation practices, and available resources. Persistent challenges such as data imbalance and linguistic variation are identified, while promising directions are suggested for advancing equitable and effective cross-lingual information retrieval. By situating CLIR within the broader landscape of information retrieval and multilingual language processing, this work not only reviews current capabilities but also outlines future directions for building retrieval systems that are robust, inclusive, and adaptable.

      The real estate market is vital to global economies but suffers from significant information asymmetry. This study examines how Large Language Models (LLMs) can democratize access to real estate insights by generating competitive and interpretable house price estimates through optimized In-Context Learning (ICL) strategies. We systematically evaluate leading LLMs on diverse international housing datasets, comparing zero-shot, few-shot, market report-enhanced, and hybrid prompting techniques. Our results show that LLMs effectively leverage hedonic variables, such as property size and amenities, to produce meaningful estimates. While traditional machine learning models remain strong for pure predictive accuracy, LLMs offer a more accessible, interactive and interpretable alternative. Although self-explanations require cautious interpretation, we find that LLMs explain their predictions in agreement with state-of-the-art models, confirming their trustworthiness. Carefully selected in-context examples based on feature similarity and geographic proximity, significantly enhance LLM performance, yet LLMs struggle with overconfidence in price intervals and limited spatial reasoning. We offer practical guidance for structured prediction tasks through prompt optimization. Our findings highlight LLMs' potential to improve transparency in real estate appraisal and provide actionable insights for stakeholders.
