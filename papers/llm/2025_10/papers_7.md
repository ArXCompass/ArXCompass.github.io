      Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into software engineering (SE) tools for tasks that extend beyond code synthesis, including judgment under uncertainty and reasoning in ethically significant contexts. We present a fully automated framework for assessing ethical reasoning capabilities across 16 LLMs in a zero-shot setting, using 30 real-world ethically charged scenarios. Each model is prompted to identify the most applicable ethical theory to an action, assess its moral acceptability, and explain the reasoning behind their choice. Responses are compared against expert ethicists' choices using inter-model agreement metrics. Our results show that LLMs achieve an average Theory Consistency Rate (TCR) of 73.3% and Binary Agreement Rate (BAR) on moral acceptability of 86.7%, with interpretable divergences concentrated in ethically ambiguous cases. A qualitative analysis of free-text explanations reveals strong conceptual convergence across models despite surface-level lexical diversity. These findings support the potential viability of LLMs as ethical inference engines within SE pipelines, enabling scalable, auditable, and adaptive integration of user-aligned ethical reasoning. Our focus is the Ethical Interpreter component of a broader profiling pipeline: we evaluate whether current LLMs exhibit sufficient interpretive stability and theory-consistent reasoning to support automated profiling.

      While search-augmented large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities, their reliability in complex multi-hop reasoning remains limited. This limitation arises from three fundamental challenges: decomposition errors, where tasks are incorrectly broken down; retrieval missing, where key evidence fails to be retrieved; and reasoning errors, where flawed logic propagates through the reasoning chain. A single failure in any of these stages can derail the final answer. We propose Erasable Reinforcement Learning (ERL), a novel framework that transforms fragile reasoning into a robust process. ERL explicitly identifies faulty steps, erases them, and regenerates reasoning in place, preventing defective logic from propagating through the reasoning chain. This targeted correction mechanism turns brittle reasoning into a more resilient process. Models trained with ERL, termed ESearch, achieve substantial improvements on HotpotQA, MuSiQue, 2Wiki, and Bamboogle, with the 3B model achieving +8.48% EM and +11.56% F1, and the 7B model achieving +5.38% EM and +7.22% F1 over previous state-of-the-art(SOTA) results. These findings suggest that erasable reinforcement learning provides a powerful paradigm shift for robust multi-step reasoning in LLMs.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      As large language models (LLMs) evolve from conversational assistants into autonomous agents, evaluating the safety of their actions becomes critical. Prior safety benchmarks have primarily focused on preventing generation of harmful content, such as toxic text. However, they overlook the challenge of agents taking harmful actions when the most effective path to an operational goal conflicts with human safety. To address this gap, we introduce ManagerBench, a benchmark that evaluates LLM decision-making in realistic, human-validated managerial scenarios. Each scenario forces a choice between a pragmatic but harmful action that achieves an operational goal, and a safe action that leads to worse operational performance. A parallel control set, where potential harm is directed only at inanimate objects, measures a model's pragmatism and identifies its tendency to be overly safe. Our findings indicate that the frontier LLMs perform poorly when navigating this safety-pragmatism trade-off. Many consistently choose harmful options to advance their operational goals, while others avoid harm only to become overly safe and ineffective. Critically, we find this misalignment does not stem from an inability to perceive harm, as models' harm assessments align with human judgments, but from flawed prioritization. ManagerBench is a challenging benchmark for a core component of agentic behavior: making safe choices when operational goals and alignment values incentivize conflicting actions.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Recent years have witnessed a surge in the number of large language models (LLMs), yet efficiently managing and utilizing these vast resources remains a significant challenge. In this work, we explore how to learn compact representations of LLM abilities that can facilitate downstream tasks, such as model routing and performance prediction on new benchmarks. We frame this problem as estimating the probability that a given model will correctly answer a specific query. Inspired by the item response theory (IRT) in psychometrics, we model this probability as a function of three key factors: (i) the model's multi-skill ability vector, (2) the query's discrimination vector that separates models of differing skills, and (3) the query's difficulty scalar. To learn these parameters jointly, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) network that couples model- and query-level embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach leads to state-of-the-art performance in both model routing and benchmark accuracy prediction. Moreover, analysis validates that the learned parameters encode meaningful, interpretable information about model capabilities and query characteristics.

    </div>
    <details class="paper-abstract">
      We study LLM routing, the problem of selecting the best model for each query while balancing user satisfaction, model expertise, and inference cost. We formulate routing as contextual dueling bandits, learning from pairwise preference feedback rather than absolute scores, thereby yielding label-efficient and dynamic adaptation. Building on this formulation, we introduce Category-Calibrated Fine-Tuning (CCFT), a representation-learning method that derives model embeddings from offline data using contrastive fine-tuning with categorical weighting. These embeddings enable the practical instantiation of Feel-Good Thompson Sampling for Contextual Dueling Bandits (FGTS.CDB), a theoretically grounded posterior-sampling algorithm. We propose four variants of the categorical weighting that explicitly integrate model quality and cost, and we empirically evaluate the proposed methods on the RouterBench and MixInstruct datasets. Across both benchmarks, our methods achieve lower cumulative regret and faster convergence, with better robustness and performance-cost balance than strong baselines built with a general-purpose OpenAI embedding model.

      \textbf{RE}trieval-\textbf{A}ugmented \textbf{L}LM-based \textbf{M}achine \textbf{T}ranslation (REAL-MT) shows promise for knowledge-intensive tasks like idiomatic translation, but its reliability under noisy retrieval contexts remains poorly understood despite this being a common challenge in real-world deployment. To address this gap, we propose a noise synthesis framework and new metrics to evaluate the robustness of REAL-MT systematically. Using this framework, we instantiate REAL-MT with Qwen-series models, including standard LLMs and large reasoning models (LRMs) with enhanced reasoning, and evaluate their performance on idiomatic translation across high-, medium-, and low-resource language pairs under synthesized noise. Our results show that low-resource language pairs, which rely more heavily on retrieved context, degrade more severely under noise than high-resource ones and often produce nonsensical translations. Although LRMs possess enhanced reasoning capabilities, they show no improvement in error correction and are even more susceptible to noise, tending to rationalize incorrect contexts. We find that this stems from an attention shift away from the source idiom to noisy content, while confidence increases despite declining accuracy, indicating poor calibration. To mitigate these issues, we investigate training-free and fine-tuning strategies, which improve robustness at the cost of performance in clean contexts, revealing a fundamental trade-off. Our findings highlight the limitations of current approaches, underscoring the need for self-verifying integration mechanisms.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Reinforcement Learning, particularly through policy gradient methods, has played a central role in enabling reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models. However, the optimization stability of policy gradients in this setting remains understudied. As a result, existing implementations often resort to conservative hyperparameter choices to ensure stability, which requires more training samples and increases computational costs. Hence, developing models for reliably tracking the underlying optimization dynamics and leveraging them into training enables more sample-efficient regimes and further unleashes scalable post-training. We address this gap by formalizing the stochastic optimization problem of policy gradients with explicit consideration of second-order geometry. We propose a tractable computational framework that tracks and leverages curvature information during policy updates. We further employ this framework to design interventions in the optimization process through data selection. The resultant algorithm, Curvature-Aware Policy Optimization (CAPO), identifies samples that contribute to unstable updates and masks them out. Theoretically, we establish monotonic improvement guarantees under realistic assumptions. On standard math reasoning benchmarks, we empirically show that CAPO ensures stable updates under aggressive learning regimes where baselines catastrophically fail. With minimal intervention (rejecting fewer than 8% of tokens), CAPO achieves up to 30x improvement in sample efficiency over standard GRPO for LLM reasoning.

      📅 2025-10-01
    </div>
    <details class="paper-abstract">
      We investigate how to adapt small, efficient LLMs to Faroese, a low-resource North Germanic language. Starting from English models, we continue pre-training on related Scandinavian languages, either individually or combined via merging, before fine-tuning on Faroese. We compare full fine-tuning with parameter-efficient tuning using LoRA, evaluating their impact on both linguistic accuracy and text comprehension. Due to the lack of existing Faroese evaluation data, we construct two new minimal-pair benchmarks from adapted and newly collected datasets and complement them with human evaluations by Faroese linguists. Our results demonstrate that transfer from related languages is crucial, though the optimal source language depends on the task: Icelandic enhances linguistic accuracy, whereas Danish boosts comprehension. Similarly, the choice between full fine-tuning and LoRA is task-dependent: LoRA improves linguistic acceptability and slightly increases human evaluation scores on the base model, while full fine-tuning yields stronger comprehension performance and better preserves model capabilities during downstream fine-tuning.

      Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly studied in the context of multi-turn reasoning, where models iteratively refine their outputs based on user-provided feedback. Such settings are crucial for tasks that require complex reasoning, yet existing feedback paradigms often rely on issuing new messages. LLMs struggle to integrate these reliably, leading to inconsistent improvements. In this work, we introduce in-place feedback, a novel interaction paradigm in which users directly edit an LLM's previous response, and the model conditions on this modified response to generate its revision. Empirical evaluations on diverse reasoning-intensive benchmarks reveal that in-place feedback achieves better performance than conventional multi-turn feedback while using $79.1\%$ fewer tokens. Complementary analyses on controlled environments further demonstrate that in-place feedback resolves a core limitation of multi-turn feedback: models often fail to apply feedback precisely to erroneous parts of the response, leaving errors uncorrected and sometimes introducing new mistakes into previously correct content. These findings suggest that in-place feedback offers a more natural and effective mechanism for guiding LLMs in reasoning-intensive tasks.

      Simplifying complex texts is essential for ensuring equitable access to information, especially for individuals with cognitive impairments. The Easy-to-Read (ETR) initiative offers a framework for making content accessible to the neurodivergent population, but the manual creation of such texts remains time-consuming and resource-intensive. In this work, we investigate the potential of large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation of ETR content. To address the scarcity of aligned corpora and the specificity of ETR constraints, we propose a multi-task learning (MTL) approach that trains models jointly on text summarization, text simplification, and ETR generation. We explore two different strategies: multi-task retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for in-context learning, and MTL-LoRA for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Our experiments with Mistral-7B and LLaMA-3-8B, based on ETR-fr, a new high-quality dataset, demonstrate the benefits of multi-task setups over single-task baselines across all configurations. Moreover, results show that the RAG-based strategy enables generalization in out-of-domain settings, while MTL-LoRA outperforms all learning strategies within in-domain configurations.

      Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in dynamic, real-world environments, where success requires both reasoning and effective tool use. A central challenge for agentic tasks is the growing context length, as agents must accumulate long histories of actions and observations. This expansion raises costs and reduces efficiency in long-horizon tasks, yet prior work on context compression has mostly focused on single-step tasks or narrow applications. We introduce Agent Context Optimization (ACON), a unified framework that optimally compresses both environment observations and interaction histories into concise yet informative condensations. ACON leverages compression guideline optimization in natural language space: given paired trajectories where full context succeeds but compressed context fails, capable LLMs analyze the causes of failure, and the compression guideline is updated accordingly. Furthermore, we propose distilling the optimized LLM compressor into smaller models to reduce the overhead of the additional module. Experiments on AppWorld, OfficeBench, and Multi-objective QA show that ACON reduces memory usage by 26-54% (peak tokens) while largely preserving task performance, preserves over 95% of accuracy when distilled into smaller compressors, and enhances smaller LMs as long-horizon agents with up to 46% performance improvement.

      As Large Language Models (LLMs) transition from static tools to autonomous agents, traditional evaluation benchmarks that measure performance on downstream tasks are becoming insufficient. These methods fail to capture the emergent social and cognitive dynamics that arise when agents communicate, persuade, and collaborate in interactive environments. To address this gap, we introduce a novel evaluation framework that uses multi-agent debate as a controlled "social laboratory" to discover and quantify these behaviors. In our framework, LLM-based agents, instantiated with distinct personas and incentives, deliberate on a wide range of challenging topics under the supervision of an LLM moderator. Our analysis, enabled by a new suite of psychometric and semantic metrics, reveals several key findings. Across hundreds of debates, we uncover a powerful and robust emergent tendency for agents to seek consensus, consistently reaching high semantic agreement ({\mu} > 0.88) even without explicit instruction and across sensitive topics. We show that assigned personas induce stable, measurable psychometric profiles, particularly in cognitive effort, and that the moderators persona can significantly alter debate outcomes by structuring the environment, a key finding for external AI alignment. This work provides a blueprint for a new class of dynamic, psychometrically grounded evaluation protocols designed for the agentic setting, offering a crucial methodology for understanding and shaping the social behaviors of the next generation of AI agents. We have released the code and results at https://github.com/znreza/multi-agent-LLM-eval-for-debate.

      Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a powerful approach to enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing implementations, such as in-context learning and fine-tuning, remain costly and inefficient. To improve CoT reasoning at a lower cost, and inspired by the task vector paradigm, we introduce CoT Vectors, compact representations that encode task-general, multi-step reasoning knowledge. Through experiments with Extracted CoT Vectors, we observe pronounced layer-wise instability, manifesting as a U-shaped performance curve that reflects a systematic three-stage reasoning process in LLMs. To address this limitation, we propose Learnable CoT Vectors, optimized under a teacher-student framework to provide more stable and robust guidance. Extensive evaluations across diverse benchmarks and models demonstrate that CoT Vectors not only outperform existing baselines but also achieve performance comparable to parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, while requiring fewer trainable parameters. Moreover, by treating CoT Vectors as a probe, we uncover how their effectiveness varies due to latent space structure, information density, acquisition mechanisms, and pre-training differences, offering new insights into the functional organization of multi-step reasoning in LLMs. The source code will be released.
