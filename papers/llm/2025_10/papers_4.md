      Large language models (LLMs) often suffer from catastrophic forgetting in continual learning (CL) scenarios, where performance on previously learned tasks degrades severely while training on sequentially arriving tasks. Although pioneering CL approaches using orthogonal subspaces can mitigate task interference, they typically employ fixed budget allocation, neglecting the varying complexity across tasks and layers. Besides, recent budget-adaptive tuning methods for LLMs often adopt multi-stage paradigms that decouple optimization and budget allocation. Such decoupling results in potential misalignment, which hinders those approaches' practical application in CL scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose OA-Adapter, a novel parameter-efficient approach for continual learning in LLMs that unifies dynamic budget adaptation with orthogonal subspace learning in an end-to-end training stage. Specifically, OA-Adapter introduces a dynamic bottleneck dimension adaptation mechanism that simultaneously allocates an efficient parameter budget and optimizes task objectives without misalignment.To effectively preserve previously acquired knowledge while coordinating with the dynamic budget allocation, orthogonal constraints are applied specifically between the parameter subspace of the current task and the dynamically allocated parameter subspaces of historical tasks. Experimental results on continual learning benchmarks demonstrate that OA-Adapter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and parameter efficiency. OA-Adapter achieves higher average accuracy while using 58.5% fewer parameters on the standard CL benchmark, and maintains its advantages on two larger benchmarks comprising 15 tasks.

      We propose a method for confidence estimation in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems that aligns closely with the correctness of large language model (LLM) outputs. Confidence estimation is especially critical in high-stakes domains such as finance and healthcare, where the cost of an incorrect answer outweighs that of not answering the question. Our approach extends prior uncertainty quantification methods by leveraging raw feed-forward network (FFN) activations as auto-regressive signals, avoiding the information loss inherent in token logits and probabilities after projection and softmax normalization. We model confidence prediction as a sequence classification task, and regularize training with a Huber loss term to improve robustness against noisy supervision. Applied in a real-world financial industry customer-support setting with complex knowledge bases, our method outperforms strong baselines and maintains high accuracy under strict latency constraints. Experiments on Llama 3.1 8B model show that using activations from only the 16th layer preserves accuracy while reducing response latency. Our results demonstrate that activation-based confidence modeling offers a scalable, architecture-aware path toward trustworthy RAG deployment.

      Decompiler is a specialized type of reverse engineering tool extensively employed in program analysis tasks, particularly in program comprehension and vulnerability detection. However, current Solidity smart contract decompilers face significant limitations in reconstructing the original source code. In particular, the bottleneck of SOTA decompilers lies in inaccurate method identification, incorrect variable type recovery, and missing contract attributes. These deficiencies hinder downstream tasks and understanding of the program logic. To address these challenges, we propose SmartHalo, a new framework that enhances decompiler output by combining static analysis (SA) and large language models (LLM). SmartHalo leverages the complementary strengths of SA's accuracy in control and data flow analysis and LLM's capability in semantic prediction. More specifically, \system{} constructs a new data structure - Dependency Graph (DG), to extract semantic dependencies via static analysis. Then, it takes DG to create prompts for LLM optimization. Finally, the correctness of LLM outputs is validated through symbolic execution and formal verification. Evaluation on a dataset consisting of 465 randomly selected smart contract methods shows that SmartHalo significantly improves the quality of the decompiled code, compared to SOTA decompilers (e.g., Gigahorse). Notably, integrating GPT-4o with SmartHalo further enhances its performance, achieving precision rates of 87.39% for method boundaries, 90.39% for variable types, and 80.65% for contract attributes.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in evaluative processes, from information filtering to assessing and addressing knowledge gaps through explanation and credibility judgments. This raises the need to examine how such evaluations are built, what assumptions they rely on, and how their strategies diverge from those of humans. We benchmark six LLMs against expert ratings--NewsGuard and Media Bias/Fact Check--and against human judgments collected through a controlled experiment. We use news domains purely as a controlled benchmark for evaluative tasks, focusing on the underlying mechanisms rather than on news classification per se. To enable direct comparison, we implement a structured agentic framework in which both models and nonexpert participants follow the same evaluation procedure: selecting criteria, retrieving content, and producing justifications. Despite output alignment, our findings show consistent differences in the observable criteria guiding model evaluations, suggesting that lexical associations and statistical priors could influence evaluations in ways that differ from contextual reasoning. This reliance is associated with systematic effects: political asymmetries and a tendency to confuse linguistic form with epistemic reliability--a dynamic we term epistemia, the illusion of knowledge that emerges when surface plausibility replaces verification. Indeed, delegating judgment to such systems may affect the heuristics underlying evaluative processes, suggesting a shift from normative reasoning toward pattern-based approximation and raising open questions about the role of LLMs in evaluative processes.

      Search augmentation empowers Large Language Models with retrieval capabilities to overcome the limitations imposed by static parameters. Recently, Reinforcement Learning leverages tailored reward signals as a viable technique to enhance LLMs performing tasks involving search. However, existing reward modeling for search-augmented LLMs faces several limitations. Rule-based rewards, such as Exact Match, are verifiable but fragile to variations in expression and cannot be applied to long-form workloads. In contrast, generative rewards improve robustness, but designing verifiable and stable rewards for long-form workloads in dynamic corpora remains challenging and also incurs high computational costs. In this paper, we propose a unified and verifiable paradigm, "nugget-as-rubric", which treats atomic information points as structured evaluation criteria for different search-augmentation workloads. Short-form tasks correspond to a single rubric, whereas long-form tasks expand to multiple rubrics aligned with the question's information needs. To support long-form settings, we design an automatic rubric construction pipeline based on query rewriting, which can automatically retrieve passages relevant to each question and extract rubrics from them, both from static corpora and from dynamic online web content. Furthermore, we introduce \textbf{Search-Gen-V}, a 4B-parameter efficient generative verifier under our proposed verifiable paradigm, which is trained via the idea of distillation and a two-stage strategy. Experimental results show that Search-Gen-V achieves strong verification accuracy across different workloads, making it a scalable, robust, and efficient verifiable reward constructor for search-augmented LLMs.

      Large language models have recently demonstrated advanced capabilities in solving IMO and Putnam problems; yet their role in research mathematics has remained fairly limited. The key difficulty is verification: suggested proofs may look plausible, but cannot be trusted without rigorous checking. We present a framework, called LLM+CAS, and an associated tool, O-Forge, that couples frontier LLMs with a computer algebra systems (CAS) in an In-Context Symbolic Feedback loop to produce proofs that are both creative and symbolically verified. Our focus is on asymptotic inequalities, a topic that often involves difficult proofs and appropriate decomposition of the domain into the "right" subdomains. Many mathematicians, including Terry Tao, have suggested that using AI tools to find the right decompositions can be very useful for research-level asymptotic analysis. In this paper, we show that our framework LLM+CAS turns out to be remarkably effective at proposing such decompositions via a combination of a frontier LLM and a CAS. More precisely, we use an LLM to suggest domain decomposition, and a CAS (such as Mathematica) that provides a verification of each piece axiomatically. Using this loop, we answer a question posed by Terence Tao: whether LLMs coupled with a verifier can be used to help prove intricate asymptotic inequalities. More broadly, we show how AI can move beyond contest math towards research-level tools for professional mathematicians.

      The application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recommender systems faces key challenges in delivering deep personalization and intelligent reasoning, especially for interactive scenarios. Current methods are often constrained by limited context windows and single-turn reasoning, hindering their ability to capture dynamic user preferences and proactively reason over recommendation contexts. To address these limitations, we propose MR.Rec, a novel framework that synergizes memory and reasoning for LLM-based recommendations. To achieve personalization, we develop a comprehensive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that efficiently indexes and retrieves relevant external memory to enhance LLM personalization capabilities. Furthermore, to enable the synergy between memory and reasoning, our RAG system goes beyond conventional query-based retrieval by integrating reasoning enhanced memory retrieval. Finally, we design a reinforcement learning framework that trains the LLM to autonomously learn effective strategies for both memory utilization and reasoning refinement. By combining dynamic memory retrieval with adaptive reasoning, this approach ensures more accurate, context-aware, and highly personalized recommendations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MR.Rec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics, validating its efficacy in delivering intelligent and personalized recommendations. We will release code and data upon paper notification.

      Text-To-Speech synthesis has achieved near-human quality in neutral speech, but emotional expressiveness remains a challenge. Existing methods often rely on costly emotion annotations or optimize indirect objectives that fail to capture the emotional expressiveness and perceptual naturalness of speech, leading to generated speech that is accurate but emotionally flat. To address these challenges, we propose the RLAIF-SPA framework, incorporating a Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) mechanism to employ Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Large Language Model (LLM) techniques to respectively judge semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional label alignment as a direct reward for emotional expressiveness and intelligibility optimization. Specifically, it leverages Prosodic Label Alignment to enhance expressive quality by jointly considering semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional alignment along four fine-grained dimensions: Structure, Emotion, Speed, and Tone. In addition, it incorporates Semantic Accuracy Feedback to ensure the generation of clear and accurate speech. Experiments on the Libri Speech dataset show that RLAIF-SPA outperforms Chat-TTS, with a 26.1% reduction in WER, a 9.1% increase in SIM-O, and over 10% improvement in human evaluation.

      Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for intelligent surveillance, but a significant challenge lies in identifying complex anomalies, which are events defined by intricate relationships and temporal dependencies among multiple entities rather than by isolated actions. While self-supervised learning (SSL) methods effectively model low-level spatiotemporal patterns, they often struggle to grasp the semantic meaning of these interactions. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) offer powerful contextual reasoning but are computationally expensive for frame-by-frame analysis and lack fine-grained spatial localization. We introduce HyCoVAD, Hybrid Complex Video Anomaly Detection, a hybrid SSL-LLM model that combines a multi-task SSL temporal analyzer with LLM validator. The SSL module is built upon an nnFormer backbone which is a transformer-based model for image segmentation. It is trained with multiple proxy tasks, learns from video frames to identify those suspected of anomaly. The selected frames are then forwarded to the LLM, which enriches the analysis with semantic context by applying structured, rule-based reasoning to validate the presence of anomalies. Experiments on the challenging ComplexVAD dataset show that HyCoVAD achieves a 72.5% frame-level AUC, outperforming existing baselines by 12.5% while reducing LLM computation. We release our interaction anomaly taxonomy, adaptive thresholding protocol, and code to facilitate future research in complex VAD scenarios.

      A new trend uses LLMs as dense text encoders via contrastive learning. However, since LLM embeddings predict the probability distribution of the next token, they are inherently generative and distributive, conflicting with contrastive learning, which requires embeddings to capture full-text semantics and align via cosine similarity. This discrepancy hinders the full utilization of LLMs' pre-training capabilities, resulting in inefficient learning. In response to this issue, we propose AutoRegEmbed, a new contrastive learning method built on embedding conditional probability distributions, which integrates two core tasks: information compression and conditional distribution alignment. The information compression task encodes text into the embedding space, ensuring that the embedding vectors capture global semantics. The conditional distribution alignment task focuses on aligning text embeddings with positive samples embeddings by leveraging the conditional distribution of embeddings while simultaneously reducing the likelihood of generating negative samples from text embeddings, thereby achieving embedding alignment and uniformity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms traditional contrastive learning approaches and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models when using the same amount of data.

      Knowledge graphs (KGs), with their structured representation capabilities, offer promising avenue for enhancing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, leading to the development of KG-RAG systems. Nevertheless, existing methods often struggle to achieve effective synergy between system effectiveness and cost efficiency, leading to neither unsatisfying performance nor excessive LLM prompt tokens and inference time. To this end, this paper proposes REMINDRAG, which employs an LLM-guided graph traversal featuring node exploration, node exploitation, and, most notably, memory replay, to improve both system effectiveness and cost efficiency. Specifically, REMINDRAG memorizes traversal experience within KG edge embeddings, mirroring the way LLMs "memorize" world knowledge within their parameters, but in a train-free manner. We theoretically and experimentally confirm the effectiveness of REMINDRAG, demonstrating its superiority over existing baselines across various benchmark datasets and LLM backbones.

      Recent trends in LLMs development clearly show growing interest in the use and application of sovereign LLMs. The global debate over sovereign LLMs highlights the need for governments to develop their LLMs, tailored to their unique socio-cultural and historical contexts. However, there remains a shortage of frameworks and datasets to verify two critical questions: (1) how well these models align with users' socio-cultural backgrounds, and (2) whether they maintain safety and technical robustness without exposing users to potential harms and risks. To address this gap, we construct a new dataset and introduce an analytic framework for extracting and evaluating the socio-cultural elements of sovereign LLMs, alongside assessments of their technical robustness. Our experimental results demonstrate that while sovereign LLMs play a meaningful role in supporting low-resource languages, they do not always meet the popular claim that these models serve their target users well. We also show that pursuing this untested claim may lead to underestimating critical quality attributes such as safety. Our study suggests that advancing sovereign LLMs requires a more extensive evaluation that incorporates a broader range of well-grounded and practical criteria.

      Recent LLM agents have made great use of chain of thought reasoning and function calling. As their capabilities grow, an important question arises: can this software represent not only a smart problem-solving tool, but an entity in its own right, that can plan, design immediate tasks, and reason toward broader, more ambiguous goals? To study this question, we adopt an open-ended experimental setting where we augment a pretrained LLM agent with the ability to generate its own tasks, accumulate knowledge, and interact extensively with its environment. We study the resulting open-ended agent qualitatively. It can reliably follow complex multi-step instructions, store and reuse information across runs, and propose and solve its own tasks, though it remains sensitive to prompt design, prone to repetitive task generation, and unable to form self-representations. These findings illustrate both the promise and current limits of adapting pretrained LLMs toward open-endedness, and point to future directions for training agents to manage memory, explore productively, and pursue abstract long-term goals.

      Logical reasoning with large language models (LLMs) has received growing attention. One mainstream approach translates natural language into formal logic and then applies symbolic solvers for deduction. While effective in many tasks, these LLM-based translators often fail to generate consistent symbolic representations when the same concept appears in different linguistic forms. Such inconsistencies break logical coherence and lead to solver errors. However, most existing benchmarks lack this type of linguistic variation, which frequently occurs in real-world text, leaving the problem underexplored. To address this gap, we present SoLT, a benchmark that systematically rewrites reasoning datasets into diverse yet logically equivalent forms across multiple levels. Beyond evaluation, SoLT also provides a general method to enrich any dataset with linguistic diversity while preserving both meaning and logic. To further enhance the stability of LLM-based reasoning, we propose MenTaL, which explicitly guides models to build a concept-symbol mapping table during translation. By linking equivalent expressions to shared symbols, MenTaL maintains consistency and mitigates symbol drift. Experiments on SoLT demonstrate that LLMs indeed suffer from inconsistent symbol mapping under linguistic variation, leading to significant drops in reasoning accuracy. Meanwhile, applying MenTaL brings clear and stable performance improvements across diverse inputs. Overall, our findings reveal that overlooking linguistic diversity hides key weaknesses in LLM-based translators, and our work offers a step toward more reliable logical reasoning in varied real-world scenarios.

      Software supply-chain attacks are an important and ongoing concern in the open source software ecosystem. These attacks maintain the standard functionality that a component implements, but additionally hide malicious functionality activated only when the component reaches its target environment. Lexo addresses such stealthy attacks by automatically learning and regenerating vulnerability-free versions of potentially malicious components. Lexo first generates a set of input-output pairs to model a component's full observable behavior, which it then uses to synthesize a new version of the original component. The new component implements the original functionality but avoids stealthy malicious behavior. Throughout this regeneration process, Lexo consults several distinct instances of Large Language Models (LLMs), uses correctness and coverage metrics to shepherd these instances, and guardrails their results. Our evaluation on 100+ real-world packages, including high profile stealthy supply-chain attacks, indicates that Lexo scales across multiple domains, regenerates code efficiently (<100s on average), maintains compatibility, and succeeds in eliminating malicious code in several real-world supply-chain-attacks, even in cases when a state-of-the-art LLM fails to eliminate malicious code when prompted to do so.

      We introduce Drivelology, a unique linguistic phenomenon characterised as "nonsense with depth" - utterances that are syntactically coherent yet pragmatically paradoxical, emotionally loaded, or rhetorically subversive. While such expressions may resemble surface-level nonsense, they encode implicit meaning requiring contextual inference, moral reasoning, or emotional interpretation. We find that current large language models (LLMs), despite excelling at many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, consistently fail to grasp the layered semantics of Drivelological text. To investigate this, we construct a benchmark dataset of over 1,200+ meticulously curated and diverse examples across English, Mandarin, Spanish, French, Japanese, and Korean. Each example underwent careful expert review to verify its Drivelological characteristics, involving multiple rounds of discussion and adjudication to address disagreements. Using this dataset, we evaluate a range of LLMs on classification, generation, and reasoning tasks. Our results reveal clear limitations of LLMs: models often confuse Drivelology with shallow nonsense, produce incoherent justifications, or miss implied rhetorical functions altogether. These findings highlight a deep representational gap in LLMs' pragmatic understanding and challenge the assumption that statistical fluency implies cognitive comprehension. We release our dataset and code to facilitate further research in modelling linguistic depth beyond surface-level coherence.

Notably, in both languages, and more prominently in Hindi, men are more frequently addressed with honorifics than women. (iii) To examine whether large language models (LLMs) internalize similar socio-pragmatic norms, we probe six LLMs using controlled generation and translation tasks over 1,000 culturally balanced entities. We find that LLMs diverge from Wikipedia usage, exhibiting alternative preferences in honorific selection across tasks, languages, and socio-demographic attributes.

      While Neural Network pruning typically requires retraining the model to recover pruning-induced performance degradation, state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) pruning methods instead solve a layer-wise mask selection and reconstruction problem on a small set of calibration data to avoid full retraining, as it is considered computationally infeasible for LLMs. Reconstructing single matrices in isolation has favorable properties, such as convexity of the objective and significantly reduced memory requirements compared to full retraining. In practice, however, reconstruction is often implemented at coarser granularities, e.g., reconstructing a whole transformer block against its dense activations instead of a single matrix. In this work, we study the key design choices when reconstructing or retraining the remaining weights after pruning. We conduct an extensive computational study on state-of-the-art GPT architectures, and report several surprising findings that challenge common intuitions about retraining after pruning. In particular, we observe a free lunch scenario: reconstructing attention and MLP components separately within each transformer block is nearly the most resource-efficient yet achieves the best perplexity. Most importantly, this Pareto-optimal setup achieves better performance than full retraining, despite requiring only a fraction of the memory. Furthermore, we demonstrate that simple and efficient pruning criteria such as Wanda can outperform much more complex approaches when the reconstruction step is properly executed, highlighting its importance. Our findings challenge the narrative that retraining should be avoided at all costs and provide important insights into post-pruning performance recovery for LLMs.

However, existing evaluations lack grounding in real-world scenarios and do not account for differences in harm severity, e.g., a biased decision in surgery should not be weighed the same as a stylistic bias in text summarization. To address this gap, we introduce HALF (Harm-Aware LLM Fairness), a deployment-aligned framework that assesses model bias in realistic applications and weighs the outcomes by harm severity. HALF organizes nine application domains into three tiers (Severe, Moderate, Mild) using a five-stage pipeline. Our evaluation results across eight LLMs show that (1) LLMs are not consistently fair across domains, (2) model size or performance do not guarantee fairness, and (3) reasoning models perform better in medical decision support but worse in education. We conclude that HALF exposes a clear gap between previous benchmarking success and deployment readiness.

      The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into software engineering has driven a transition from traditional rule-based systems to autonomous agentic systems capable of solving complex problems. However, systematic progress is hindered by a lack of comprehensive understanding of how benchmarks and solutions interconnect. This survey addresses this gap by providing the first holistic analysis of LLM-powered software engineering, offering insights into evaluation methodologies and solution paradigms. We review over 150 recent papers and propose a taxonomy along two key dimensions: (1) Solutions, categorized into prompt-based, fine-tuning-based, and agent-based paradigms, and (2) Benchmarks, including tasks such as code generation, translation, and repair. Our analysis highlights the evolution from simple prompt engineering to sophisticated agentic systems incorporating capabilities like planning, reasoning, memory mechanisms, and tool augmentation. To contextualize this progress, we present a unified pipeline illustrating the workflow from task specification to deliverables, detailing how different solution paradigms address various complexity levels. Unlike prior surveys that focus narrowly on specific aspects, this work connects 50+ benchmarks to their corresponding solution strategies, enabling researchers to identify optimal approaches for diverse evaluation criteria. We also identify critical research gaps and propose future directions, including multi-agent collaboration, self-evolving systems, and formal verification integration. This survey serves as a foundational guide for advancing LLM-driven software engineering.

      Reasoning ability has become a defining capability of Large Language Models (LLMs), with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) emerging as a key paradigm to enhance it. However, RLVR training often suffers from policy entropy collapse, where the policy becomes overly deterministic, hindering exploration and limiting reasoning performance. While entropy regularization is a common remedy, its effectiveness is highly sensitive to the fixed coefficient, making it unstable across tasks and models. In this work, we revisit entropy regularization in RLVR and argue that its potential has been largely underestimated. Our analysis shows that (i) tasks of varying difficulty demand distinct exploration intensities, and (ii) balanced exploration may require the policy entropy to be maintained within a moderate range below its initial level. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Entropy Regularization (AER)--a framework that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation via three components: difficulty-aware coefficient allocation, initial-anchored target entropy, and dynamic global coefficient adjustment. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that AER consistently outperforms baselines, improving both reasoning accuracy and exploration capability.

      A growing body of multi-agent studies with Large Language Models (LLMs) explores how norms and cooperation emerge in mixed-motive scenarios, where pursuing individual gain can undermine the collective good. While prior work has explored these dynamics in both richly contextualized simulations and simplified game-theoretic environments, most LLM systems featuring common-pool resource (CPR) games provide agents with explicit reward functions directly tied to their actions. In contrast, human cooperation often emerges without full visibility into payoffs and population, relying instead on heuristics, communication, and punishment. We introduce a CPR simulation framework that removes explicit reward signals and embeds cultural-evolutionary mechanisms: social learning (adopting strategies and beliefs from successful peers) and norm-based punishment, grounded in Ostrom's principles of resource governance. Agents also individually learn from the consequences of harvesting, monitoring, and punishing via environmental feedback, enabling norms to emerge endogenously. We establish the validity of our simulation by reproducing key findings from existing studies on human behavior. Building on this, we examine norm evolution across a $2\times2$ grid of environmental and social initialisations (resource-rich vs. resource-scarce; altruistic vs. selfish) and benchmark how agentic societies comprised of different LLMs perform under these conditions. Our results reveal systematic model differences in sustaining cooperation and norm formation, positioning the framework as a rigorous testbed for studying emergent norms in mixed-motive LLM societies. Such analysis can inform the design of AI systems deployed in social and organizational contexts, where alignment with cooperative norms is critical for stability, fairness, and effective governance of AI-mediated environments.

      Large language model (LLM) inference systems face a fundamental tension between minimizing Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) latency for new requests and maintaining a high, steady token generation rate (low Time-Per-Output-Token, or TPOT) for ongoing requests. Existing stall-free batching schedulers proposed by Sarathi, while effective at preventing decode stalls, introduce significant computational unfairness. They prioritize decode tasks excessively, simultaneously leading to underutilized decode slack and unnecessary prefill queuing delays, which collectively degrade the system's overall quality of service (QoS). This work identifies the root cause of this unfairness: the non-monotonic nature of Time-Between-Tokens (TBT) as a scheduling metric and the rigid decode-prioritizing policy that fails to adapt to dynamic workload bursts. We therefore propose FairBatching, a novel LLM inference scheduler that enforces fair resource allocation between prefill and decode tasks. It features an adaptive batch capacity determination mechanism, which dynamically adjusts the computational budget to improve the GPU utilization without triggering SLO violations. Its fair and dynamic batch formation algorithm breaks away from the decode-prioritizing paradigm, allowing computation resources to be reclaimed from bursting decode tasks to serve prefill surges, achieving global fairness. Furthermore, FairBatching provides a novel load estimation method, enabling more effective coordination with upper-level schedulers. Implemented and evaluated on realistic traces, FairBatching significantly reduces TTFT tail latency by up to 2.29x while robustly maintaining TPOT SLOs, achieving overall 20.0% improvement in single-node capacity and 54.3% improvement in cluster-level capacity.

      Math reasoning has been one crucial ability of large language models (LLMs), where significant advancements have been achieved in recent years. However, most efforts focus on LLMs by curating high-quality annotation data and intricate training (or inference) paradigms, while the math reasoning performance of multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) remains lagging behind. Since the MLLM typically consists of an LLM and a vision block, we wonder: Can MLLMs directly absorb math reasoning abilities from off-the-shelf math LLMs without tuning? Recent model-merging approaches may offer insights into this question. However, they overlook the alignment between the MLLM and LLM, where we find that there is a large gap between their parameter spaces, resulting in lower performance. Our empirical evidence reveals two key factors behind this issue: the identification of crucial reasoning-associated layers in the model and the mitigation of the gaps in parameter space. Based on the empirical insights, we propose IP-Merging that first identifies the reasoning-associated parameters in both MLLM and Math LLM, then projects them into the subspace of MLLM, aiming to maintain the alignment, and finally merges parameters in this subspace. IP-Merging is a tuning-free approach since parameters are directly adjusted. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our IP-Merging method can enhance the math reasoning ability of MLLMs directly from Math LLMs without compromising their other capabilities.

      Large language model (LLM) systems now underpin everyday AI applications such as chatbots, computer-use assistants, and autonomous robots, where performance often depends on carefully designed prompts. LLM-based prompt optimizers reduce that effort by iteratively refining prompts from scored feedback, yet the security of this optimization stage remains underexamined. We present the first systematic analysis of poisoning risks in LLM-based prompt optimization. Using HarmBench, we find systems are substantially more vulnerable to manipulated feedback than to injected queries: feedback-based attacks raise attack success rate (ASR) by up to $\Delta$ASR = 0.48. We introduce a simple fake-reward attack that requires no access to the reward model and significantly increases vulnerability, and we propose a lightweight highlighting defense that reduces the fake-reward $\Delta$ASR from 0.23 to 0.07 without degrading utility. These results establish prompt optimization pipelines as a first-class attack surface and motivate stronger safeguards for feedback channels and optimization frameworks.

      Proprietary large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong generalization capabilities across diverse tasks and are increasingly deployed on edge devices for efficiency and privacy reasons. However, deploying proprietary LLMs at the edge without adequate protection introduces critical security threats. Attackers can extract model weights and architectures, enabling unauthorized copying and misuse. Even when protective measures prevent full extraction of model weights, attackers may still perform advanced attacks, such as fine-tuning, to further exploit the model. Existing defenses against these threats typically incur significant computational and communication overhead, making them impractical for edge deployment. To safeguard the edge-deployed LLMs, we introduce CoreGuard, a computation- and communication-efficient protection method. CoreGuard employs an efficient protection protocol to reduce computational overhead and minimize communication overhead via a propagation protocol. Extensive experiments show that CoreGuard achieves upper-bound security protection with negligible overhead.

Surprisingly, despite strong obfuscation that fragments tokenization and reduces the signal-to-noise ratio significantly, many LLMs still maintain notable performance. Through comprehensive evaluation across model-, problem-, and noise-related configurations, we examine the extent and mechanisms of this robustness, exploring both the handling of character-level tokenization and \textit{implicit} versus \textit{explicit} denoising mechanism hypotheses of character-level noises.

Additionally, we recruit fluent AAVE speakers to validate our translations for authenticity. Our evaluations reveal that LLMs consistently perform better on SAE tasks than AAVE-translated versions, underscoring inherent biases and highlighting the need for more inclusive NLP models.

      Large language models (LLMs) can be prompted with specific styles (e.g., formatting responses as lists), including in malicious queries. Prior jailbreak research mainly augments these queries with additional string transformations to maximize attack success rate (ASR). However, the impact of style patterns in the original queries that are semantically irrelevant to the malicious intent remains unclear. In this work, we seek to understand whether style patterns compromise LLM safety, how superficial style alignment increases model vulnerability, and how best to mitigate these risks during alignment. We first define ASR inflation as the increase in ASR due to style patterns in existing jailbreak benchmark queries. By evaluating 32 LLMs across seven benchmarks, we find that nearly all models exhibit ASR inflation. Notably, the inflation correlates with an LLM's relative attention to style patterns, which also overlap more with its instruction-tuning data when inflation occurs. We then investigate superficial style alignment, and find that fine-tuning with specific styles makes LLMs more vulnerable to jailbreaks of those same styles. Finally, we propose SafeStyle, a defense strategy that incorporates a small amount of safety training data augmented to match the distribution of style patterns in the fine-tuning data. Across three LLMs, six fine-tuning style settings, and two real-world instruction-tuning datasets, SafeStyle consistently outperforms baselines in maintaining LLM safety.

      Mobile telecommunication networks are foundational to global infrastructure and increasingly support critical sectors such as manufacturing, transportation, and healthcare. The security and reliability of these networks are essential, yet depend heavily on accurate modeling of underlying protocols through state machines. While most prior work constructs such models manually from 3GPP specifications, this process is labor-intensive, error-prone, and difficult to maintain due to the complexity and frequent updates of the specifications. Recent efforts using natural language processing have shown promise, but remain limited in handling the scale and intricacy of cellular protocols. In this work, we propose SpecGPT, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically extract protocol state machines from 3GPP documents. SpecGPT segments technical specifications into meaningful paragraphs, applies domain-informed prompting with chain-of-thought reasoning, and employs ensemble methods to enhance output reliability. We evaluate SpecGPT on three representative 5G protocols (NAS, NGAP, and PFCP) using manually annotated ground truth, and show that it outperforms existing approaches, demonstrating the effectiveness of LLMs for protocol modeling at scale.

      Bayesian Optimization (BO) has been widely used to efficiently optimize expensive black-box functions with limited evaluations. In this paper, we investigate the use of BO for prompt engineering to enhance text classification with Large Language Models (LLMs). We employ an LLM-powered Gaussian Process (GP) as the surrogate model to estimate the performance of different prompt candidates. These candidates are generated by an LLM through the expansion of a set of seed prompts and are subsequently evaluated using an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) acquisition function in conjunction with the GP posterior. The optimization process iteratively refines the prompts based on a subset of the data, aiming to improve classification accuracy while reducing the number of API calls by leveraging the prediction uncertainty of the LLM-based GP. The proposed BO-LLM algorithm is evaluated on two datasets, and its advantages are discussed in detail in this paper.

      We seek algorithms for program learning that are both sample-efficient and computationally feasible. Classical results show that targets admitting short program descriptions (e.g., with short ``python code'') can be learned with a ``small'' number of examples (scaling with the size of the code) via length-first program enumeration, but the search is exponential in description length. Consequently, Gradient-based training avoids this cost yet can require exponentially many samples on certain short-program families. To address this gap, we introduce LLM-ERM, a propose-and-verify framework that replaces exhaustive enumeration with an LLM-guided search over candidate programs while retaining ERM-style selection on held-out data. Specifically, we draw $k$ candidates with a pretrained reasoning-augmented LLM, compile and check each on the data, and return the best verified hypothesis, with no feedback, adaptivity, or gradients. Theoretically, we show that coordinate-wise online mini-batch SGD requires many samples to learn certain short programs. {\em Empirically, LLM-ERM solves tasks such as parity variants, pattern matching, and primality testing with as few as 200 samples, while SGD-trained transformers overfit even with 100,000 samples}. These results indicate that language-guided program synthesis recovers much of the statistical efficiency of finite-class ERM while remaining computationally tractable, offering a practical route to learning succinct hypotheses beyond the reach of gradient-based training.

To explore these research questions, we evaluated 35 Japanese, English, and multilingual LLMs on 19 evaluation benchmarks for Japanese and English, taking Japanese as a local language. Adopting an observational approach, we analyzed correlations of benchmark scores, and conducted principal component analysis (PCA) on the scores to derive \textit{ability factors} of local LLMs. We found that training on English text can improve the scores of academic subjects in Japanese (JMMLU). In addition, it is unnecessary to specifically train on Japanese text to enhance abilities for solving Japanese code generation, arithmetic reasoning, commonsense, and reading comprehension tasks. In contrast, training on Japanese text could improve question-answering tasks about Japanese knowledge and English-Japanese translation, which indicates that abilities for solving these two tasks can be regarded as \textit{Japanese abilities} for LLMs. Furthermore, we confirmed that the Japanese abilities scale with the computational budget for Japanese text.

      Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong reasoning abilities in domains like mathematics, coding, and scientific problem-solving, yet their potential for ranking tasks, where prime examples include retrieval, recommender systems, and LLM routing, remains underexplored. Ranking requires complex reasoning across heterogeneous candidates, but existing LLM-based rankers are often domain-specific, tied to fixed backbones, and lack iterative refinement, limiting their ability to fully exploit LLMs' reasoning potential. To address these challenges, we propose R1-Ranker, a reasoning-incentive framework built on reinforcement learning, with two complementary designs: DRanker, which generates full rankings in one shot, and IRanker, which decomposes ranking into an iterative elimination process with step-wise rewards to encourage deeper reasoning. We evaluate unified R1-Rankers on nine datasets spanning recommendation, routing, and passage ranking, showing that IRanker-3B consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpasses larger 7B models on some tasks, and yields a 15.7% average relative improvement. Ablation and generalization experiments further confirm the critical role of reinforcement learning and iterative reasoning, with IRanker-3B improving zero-shot performance by over 9% on out-of-domain tasks and reasoning traces boosting other LLMs by up to 22.87%. These results demonstrate that unifying diverse ranking tasks with a single reasoning-driven foundation model is both effective and essential for advancing LLM reasoning in ranking scenarios.

Our framework consists of three specialized agents: a Question Analyzer that decomposes a multi-hop question into sub-questions, a Selector that identifies the most relevant context for each sub-question (focusing on precision), and an Adder that brings in any missing evidence (focusing on recall). The iterative interaction between Selector and Adder yields a compact yet comprehensive set of supporting passages. In particular, it achieves higher retrieval accuracy while filtering out distracting content, enabling downstream QA models to surpass full-context answer accuracy while relying on significantly less irrelevant information. Experiments on four multi-hop QA benchmarks -- HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, MuSiQue, and MultiHopRAG -- demonstrates that our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines.

      Mathematical reasoning serves as a crucial testbed for the intelligence of large language models (LLMs), and math word problems (MWPs) are a popular type of math problems. Most MWP datasets consist of problems containing only the necessary information, while problems with distracting and excessive conditions are often overlooked. Prior works have tested popular LLMs and found a dramatic performance drop in the presence of distracting conditions. However, datasets of MWPs with distracting conditions are limited, and most suffer from lower levels of difficulty and out-of-context expressions. This makes distracting conditions easy to identify and exclude, thus reducing the credibility of benchmarking on them. Moreover, when adding distracting conditions, the reasoning and answers may also change, requiring intensive labor to check and write the solutions. To address these issues, we design an iterative framework to generate distracting conditions using LLMs. We develop a set of prompts to revise MWPs from different perspectives and cognitive levels, encouraging the generation of distracting conditions as well as suggestions for further revision. Another advantage is the shared solutions between original and revised problems: we explicitly guide the LLMs to generate distracting conditions that do not alter the original solutions, thus avoiding the need to generate new solutions. This framework is efficient and easy to deploy, reducing the overhead of generating MWPs with distracting conditions while maintaining data quality.

      We study whether self-learning can scale LLM-based agents without relying on human-curated datasets or predefined rule-based rewards. Through controlled experiments in a search-agent setting, we identify two key determinants of scalable agent training: the source of reward signals and the scale of agent task data. We find that rewards from a Generative Reward Model (GRM) outperform rigid rule-based signals for open-domain learning, and that co-evolving the GRM with the policy further boosts performance. Increasing the volume of agent task data-even when synthetically generated-substantially enhances agentic capabilities. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{Agentic Self-Learning} (ASL), a fully closed-loop, multi-role reinforcement learning framework that unifies task generation, policy execution, and evaluation within a shared tool environment and LLM backbone. ASL coordinates a Prompt Generator, a Policy Model, and a Generative Reward Model to form a virtuous cycle of harder task setting, sharper verification, and stronger solving. Empirically, ASL delivers steady, round-over-round gains, surpasses strong RLVR baselines (e.g., Search-R1) that plateau or degrade, and continues improving under zero-labeled-data conditions, indicating superior sample efficiency and robustness. We further show that GRM verification capacity is the main bottleneck: if frozen, it induces reward hacking and stalls progress; continual GRM training on the evolving data distribution mitigates this, and a small late-stage injection of real verification data raises the performance ceiling. This work establishes reward source and data scale as critical levers for open-domain agent learning and demonstrates the efficacy of multi-role co-evolution for scalable, self-improving agents.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning and task planning capabilities but remain fundamentally limited in physical interaction modeling. Existing approaches integrate perception via Vision-Language Models (VLMs) or adaptive decision-making through Reinforcement Learning (RL), but they fail to capture dynamic object interactions or require task-specific training, limiting their real-world applicability. We introduce APEX (Anticipatory Physics-Enhanced Execution), a framework that equips LLMs with physics-driven foresight for real-time task planning. APEX constructs structured graphs to identify and model the most relevant dynamic interactions in the environment, providing LLMs with explicit physical state updates. Simultaneously, APEX provides low-latency forward simulations of physically feasible actions, allowing LLMs to select optimal strategies based on predictive outcomes rather than static observations. We evaluate APEX on three benchmarks designed to assess perception, prediction, and decision-making: (1) Physics Reasoning Benchmark, testing causal inference and object motion prediction; (2) Tetris, evaluating whether physics-informed prediction enhances decision-making performance in long-horizon planning tasks; (3) Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance, assessing the immediate integration of perception and action feasibility analysis. APEX significantly outperforms standard LLMs and VLM-based models, demonstrating the necessity of explicit physics reasoning for bridging the gap between language-based intelligence and real-world task execution.

      Existing safety evaluation methods for large language models (LLMs) suffer from inherent limitations, including evaluator bias and detection failures arising from model homogeneity, which collectively undermine the robustness of risk evaluation processes. This paper seeks to re-examine the risk evaluation paradigm by introducing a theoretical framework that reconstructs the underlying risk concept space. Specifically, we decompose the latent risk concept space into three mutually exclusive subspaces: the explicit risk subspace (encompassing direct violations of safety guidelines), the implicit risk subspace (capturing potential malicious content that requires contextual reasoning for identification), and the non-risk subspace. Furthermore, we propose RADAR, a multi-agent collaborative evaluation framework that leverages multi-round debate mechanisms through four specialized complementary roles and employs dynamic update mechanisms to achieve self-evolution of risk concept distributions. This approach enables comprehensive coverage of both explicit and implicit risks while mitigating evaluator bias. To validate the effectiveness of our framework, we construct an evaluation dataset comprising 800 challenging cases. Extensive experiments on our challenging testset and public benchmarks demonstrate that RADAR significantly outperforms baseline evaluation methods across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, stability, and self-evaluation risk sensitivity. Notably, RADAR achieves a 28.87% improvement in risk identification accuracy compared to the strongest baseline evaluation method.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce inconsistent answers when faced with different phrasings of the same prompt. In this paper, we propose Flip-Flop Consistency ($F^2C$), an unsupervised training method that improves robustness to such perturbations. $F^2C$ is composed of two key components. The first, Consensus Cross-Entropy (CCE), uses a majority vote across prompt variations to create a hard pseudo-label. The second is a representation alignment loss that pulls lower-confidence and non-majority predictors toward the consensus established by high-confidence, majority-voting variations. We evaluate our method on 11 datasets spanning four NLP tasks, with 4-15 prompt variations per dataset. On average, $F^2C$ raises observed agreement by 11.62%, improves mean $F_1$ by 8.94%, and reduces performance variance across formats by 3.29%. In out-of-domain evaluations, $F^2C$ generalizes effectively, increasing $\overline{F_1}$ and agreement while decreasing variance across most source-target pairs. Finally, when trained on only a subset of prompt perturbations and evaluated on held-out formats, $F^2C$ consistently improves both performance and agreement while reducing variance. These findings highlight $F^2C$ as an effective unsupervised method for enhancing LLM consistency, performance, and generalization under prompt perturbations.

      The adaptivity and maneuvering capabilities of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) have drawn significant attention in oceanic research, due to the unpredictable disturbances and strong coupling among the AUV's degrees of freedom. In this paper, we developed large language model (LLM)-enhanced reinforcement learning (RL)-based adaptive S-surface controller for AUVs. Specifically, LLMs are introduced for the joint optimization of controller parameters and reward functions in RL training. Using multi-modal and structured explicit task feedback, LLMs enable joint adjustments, balance multiple objectives, and enhance task-oriented performance and adaptability. In the proposed controller, the RL policy focuses on upper-level tasks, outputting task-oriented high-level commands that the S-surface controller then converts into control signals, ensuring cancellation of nonlinear effects and unpredictable external disturbances in extreme sea conditions. Under extreme sea conditions involving complex terrain, waves, and currents, the proposed controller demonstrates superior performance and adaptability in high-level tasks such as underwater target tracking and data collection, outperforming traditional PID and SMC controllers.

      Human cognition naturally engages with abstract and fluid concepts, whereas existing reasoning models often rely on generating discrete tokens, potentially constraining their expressive capabilities. Recent advancements aim to address this limitation by enabling large language models (LLMs) to generate soft, abstract tokens, thus facilitating reasoning within a continuous concept space. In this paper, we investigate the Soft Thinking capabilities of various LLMs through a systematic analysis of their internal behavior using a suite of probing techniques. Contrary to the prevailing belief that Soft Thinking supports parallel exploration of diverse reasoning paths, our findings reveal that LLMs behave as single-threaded reasoners--they predominantly rely on the token with the highest probability in the soft input to predict the next step. This behavior induces a greedy feedback loop that suppresses alternative reasoning paths and undermines the benefits of transmitting richer information via Soft Tokens. To address this Greedy Pitfall, we propose Stochastic Soft Thinking, which introduces stochasticity to break free from this Greedy Pitfall. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating randomness--particularly with the Gumbel-Softmax trick--can alleviate the limitations of vanilla approaches and unleash the potential of Soft Thinking, resulting in superior performance across eight reasoning benchmarks. We further demonstrate that Stochastic Soft Thinking exhibits stronger exploration potential compared to conventional COT. Our findings deepen the understanding of continuous reasoning and establish the foundation for future work on improving Soft Thinking with Reinforcement Learning.

      Large Language Model (LLM) agents are powering a growing share of interactive web applications, yet remain vulnerable to misuse and harm. Prior jailbreak research has largely focused on single-turn prompts, whereas real harassment often unfolds over multi-turn interactions. In this work, we present the Online Harassment Agentic Benchmark consisting of: (i) a synthetic multi-turn harassment conversation dataset, (ii) a multi-agent (e.g., harasser, victim) simulation informed by repeated game theory, (iii) three jailbreak methods attacking agents across memory, planning, and fine-tuning, and (iv) a mixed-methods evaluation framework. We utilize two prominent LLMs, LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct (open-source) and Gemini-2.0-flash (closed-source). Our results show that jailbreak tuning makes harassment nearly guaranteed with an attack success rate of 95.78--96.89% vs. 57.25--64.19% without tuning in Llama, and 99.33% vs. 98.46% without tuning in Gemini, while sharply reducing refusal rate to 1-2% in both models. The most prevalent toxic behaviors are Insult with 84.9--87.8% vs. 44.2--50.8% without tuning, and Flaming with 81.2--85.1% vs. 31.5--38.8% without tuning, indicating weaker guardrails compared to sensitive categories such as sexual or racial harassment. Qualitative evaluation further reveals that attacked agents reproduce human-like aggression profiles, such as Machiavellian/psychopathic patterns under planning, and narcissistic tendencies with memory. Counterintuitively, closed-source and open-source models exhibit distinct escalation trajectories across turns, with closed-source models showing significant vulnerability. Overall, our findings show that multi-turn and theory-grounded attacks not only succeed at high rates but also mimic human-like harassment dynamics, motivating the development of robust safety guardrails to ultimately keep online platforms safe and responsible.

      Internet of Things (IoT) networks generate diverse and high-volume traffic that reflects both normal activity and potential threats. Deriving meaningful insight from such telemetry requires cross-layer interpretation of behaviors, protocols, and context rather than isolated detection. This work presents an LLM-powered AI agent framework that converts raw packet captures into structured and semantically enriched representations for interactive analysis. The framework integrates feature extraction, transformer-based anomaly detection, packet and flow summarization, threat intelligence enrichment, and retrieval-augmented question answering. An AI agent guided by a large language model performs reasoning over the indexed traffic artifacts, assembling evidence to produce accurate and human-readable interpretations. Experimental evaluation on multiple IoT captures and six open models shows that hybrid retrieval, which combines lexical and semantic search with reranking, substantially improves BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, and BERTScore results compared with dense-only retrieval. System profiling further indicates low CPU, GPU, and memory overhead, demonstrating that the framework achieves holistic and efficient interpretation of IoT network traffic.

      Process reward models (PRMs) are a cornerstone of test-time scaling (TTS), designed to verify and select the best responses from large language models (LLMs). However, this promise is challenged by recent benchmarks where simple majority voting, which ignores PRM signals, occasionally outperforms standard PRM-based selection. This raises a critical question: How can we effectively utilize verification signals from PRMs for TTS? To address this, we start by developing a theoretical framework for optimally combining signals from both the LLM and the PRM. Our framework reveals that the optimal strategy is a weighted aggregation of responses, a strategy whose effectiveness hinges on estimating weights that capture the complex interplay between the models. Based on our theoretical results, we empirically show that these optimal weighting functions differ significantly across LLM-PRM pairs and, notably, often assign substantial negative weights. Motivated by these insights, we propose efficient pre-computation methods to calibrate these weighting functions. Extensive experiments across 5 LLMs and 7 PRMs demonstrate that our calibration method significantly boosts the TTS efficiency, surpassing the performance of vanilla weighted majority voting while using only $21.3\%$ of the computation. Ultimately, our work demonstrates that investing in a more intelligent aggregation strategy can be a more convincing path to performance gains than simply scaling test-time computation.

      Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities in generating functional and aesthetic web interfaces directly from instructions. However, these models often replicate accessibility flaws from their training data, resulting in interfaces that exclude users with diverse needs and contexts. To address this gap, we introduce A11yn, the first method that aligns code-generating LLMs to reliably produce accessibility-compliant web UIs. A11yn optimizes a novel reward function that penalizes violations of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), with penalties scaled to the severity of each violation as identified by an accessibility testing engine. To support training, we construct UIReq-6.8K, a dataset of 6,800 diverse instructions for web UI generation. For evaluation, we introduce RealUIReq-300, a benchmark of 300 real-world web UI requests grounded and manually curated from public web pages, spanning a broad range of use cases. Empirical results show that A11yn significantly outperforms strong baselines, lowering the Inaccessibility Rate by 60% over the base model while preserving semantic fidelity and visual quality of generated UIs. These findings demonstrate that accessibility can be systematically optimized within LLMs, showing the feasibility of aligning code generation for accessibility.

      Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates key limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs)-such as factual errors, outdated knowledge, and hallucinations-by dynamically retrieving external information. Recent work extends this paradigm through agentic RAG systems, where LLMs act as agents to iteratively plan, retrieve, and reason over complex queries. However, these systems still struggle with challenging multi-hop questions, and their intermediate reasoning capabilities remain underexplored. To address this, we propose RAGCap-Bench, a capability-oriented benchmark for fine-grained evaluation of intermediate tasks in agentic RAG workflows. We analyze outputs from state-of-the-art systems to identify common tasks and the core capabilities required for their execution, then construct a taxonomy of typical LLM errors to design targeted evaluation questions. Experiments show that "slow-thinking" models with stronger RAGCap performance achieve better end-to-end results, underscoring the benchmark's validity and the importance of enhancing these intermediate capabilities.

      Recent advances in diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have introduced a promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs for natural language generation tasks, leveraging full attention and denoising-based decoding strategies. However, the deployment of these models on edge devices remains challenging due to their massive parameter scale and high resource demands. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a widely adopted technique for compressing AR LLMs, its applicability to dLLMs remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic study on quantizing diffusion-based language models. We begin by identifying the presence of activation outliers, characterized by abnormally large activation values that dominate the dynamic range. These outliers pose a key challenge to low-bit quantization, as they make it difficult to preserve precision for the majority of values. More importantly, we implement state-of-the-art PTQ methods and conduct a comprehensive evaluation across multiple task types and model variants. Our analysis is structured along four key dimensions: bit-width, quantization method, task category, and model type. Through this multi-perspective evaluation, we offer practical insights into the quantization behavior of dLLMs under different configurations. We hope our findings provide a foundation for future research in efficient dLLM deployment. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/FelixMessi/QDLM.

      Multilingual large language models (LLMs) often demonstrate a performance gap between English and non-English languages, particularly in low-resource settings. Aligning these models to low-resource languages is essential yet challenging due to limited high-quality data. While English alignment datasets are readily available, curating equivalent data in other languages is expensive and time-consuming. A common workaround is to translate existing English alignment data; however, standard translation techniques often fail to preserve critical elements such as code, mathematical expressions, and structured formats like JSON. In this work, we investigate LLM-based selective translation, a technique that selectively translates only the translatable parts of a text while preserving non-translatable content and sentence structure. We conduct a systematic study to explore key questions around this approach, including its effectiveness compared to vanilla translation, the importance of filtering noisy outputs, and the benefits of mixing translated samples with original English data during alignment. Our experiments focus on the low-resource Indic language Hindi and compare translations generated by Google Cloud Translation (GCP) and Llama-3.1-405B. The results highlight the promise of selective translation as a practical and effective method for improving multilingual alignment in LLMs.

      Reinforcement learning (RL) has become central to training large language models (LLMs), yet the field lacks predictive scaling methodologies comparable to those established for pre-training. Despite rapidly rising compute budgets, there is no principled understanding of how to evaluate algorithmic improvements for scaling RL compute. We present the first large-scale systematic study, amounting to more than 400,000 GPU-hours, that defines a principled framework for analyzing and predicting RL scaling in LLMs. We fit sigmoidal compute-performance curves for RL training and ablate a wide range of common design choices to analyze their effects on asymptotic performance and compute efficiency. We observe: (1) Not all recipes yield similar asymptotic performance, (2) Details such as loss aggregation, normalization, curriculum, and off-policy algorithm primarily modulate compute efficiency without materially shifting the asymptote, and (3) Stable, scalable recipes follow predictable scaling trajectories, enabling extrapolation from smaller-scale runs. Combining these insights, we propose a best-practice recipe, ScaleRL, and demonstrate its effectiveness by successfully scaling and predicting validation performance on a single RL run scaled up to 100,000 GPU-hours. Our work provides both a scientific framework for analyzing scaling in RL and a practical recipe that brings RL training closer to the predictability long achieved in pre-training.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive reasoning abilities, yet their reliance on structured step-by-step processing reveals a critical limitation. In contrast, human cognition fluidly adapts between intuitive, heuristic (System 1) and analytical, deliberative (System 2) reasoning depending on the context. This difference between human cognitive flexibility and LLMs' reliance on a single reasoning style raises a critical question: while human fast heuristic reasoning evolved for its efficiency and adaptability, is a uniform reasoning approach truly optimal for LLMs, or does its inflexibility make them brittle and unreliable when faced with tasks demanding more agile, intuitive responses? To answer these questions, we explicitly align LLMs to these reasoning styles by curating a dataset with valid System 1 and System 2 answers, and evaluate their performance across reasoning benchmarks. Our results reveal an accuracy-efficiency trade-off: System 2-aligned models excel in arithmetic and symbolic reasoning, while System 1-aligned models perform better in commonsense reasoning tasks. To analyze the reasoning spectrum, we interpolated between the two extremes by varying the proportion of alignment data, which resulted in a monotonic change in accuracy. A mechanistic analysis of model responses shows that System 1 models employ more definitive outputs, whereas System 2 models demonstrate greater uncertainty. Building on these findings, we further combine System 1- and System 2-aligned models based on the entropy of their generations, without additional training, and obtain a dynamic model that outperforms across nearly all benchmarks. This work challenges the assumption that step-by-step reasoning is always optimal and highlights the need for adapting reasoning strategies based on task demands.

Confidence estimation is especially critical in high-stakes domains such as finance and healthcare, where the cost of an incorrect answer outweighs that of not answering the question. Our approach extends prior uncertainty quantification methods by leveraging raw feed-forward network (FFN) activations as auto-regressive signals, avoiding the information loss inherent in token logits and probabilities after projection and softmax normalization. We model confidence prediction as a sequence classification task, and regularize training with a Huber loss term to improve robustness against noisy supervision. Applied in a real-world financial industry customer-support setting with complex knowledge bases, our method outperforms strong baselines and maintains high accuracy under strict latency constraints. Experiments on Llama 3.1 8B model show that using activations from only the 16th layer preserves accuracy while reducing response latency.

      Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong potential for sequential recommendation. However, current LLM-based approaches face critical limitations in modeling users' long-term and diverse interests. First, due to inference latency and feature fetching bandwidth constraints, existing methods typically truncate user behavior sequences to include only the most recent interactions, resulting in the loss of valuable long-range preference signals. Second, most current methods rely on next-item prediction with a single predicted embedding, overlooking the multifaceted nature of user interests and limiting recommendation diversity. To address these challenges, we propose HyMiRec, a hybrid multi-interest sequential recommendation framework, which leverages a lightweight recommender to extracts coarse interest embeddings from long user sequences and an LLM-based recommender to captures refined interest embeddings. To alleviate the overhead of fetching features, we introduce a residual codebook based on cosine similarity, enabling efficient compression and reuse of user history embeddings. To model the diverse preferences of users, we design a disentangled multi-interest learning module, which leverages multiple interest queries to learn disentangles multiple interest signals adaptively, allowing the model to capture different facets of user intent. Extensive experiments are conducted on both benchmark datasets and a collected industrial dataset, demonstrating our effectiveness over existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, online A/B testing shows that HyMiRec brings consistent improvements in real-world recommendation systems.

      Pruning is a common technique to reduce the compute and storage requirements of Neural Networks. While conventional approaches typically retrain the model to recover pruning-induced performance degradation, state-of-the-art Large Language Model (LLM) pruning methods operate layer-wise, minimizing the per-layer pruning error on a small calibration dataset to avoid full retraining, which is considered computationally prohibitive for LLMs. However, finding the optimal pruning mask is a hard combinatorial problem and solving it to optimality is intractable. Existing methods hence rely on greedy heuristics that ignore the weight interactions in the pruning objective. In this work, we instead consider the convex relaxation of these combinatorial constraints and solve the resulting problem using the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm. Our method drastically reduces the per-layer pruning error, outperforms strong baselines on state-of-the-art GPT architectures, and remains memory-efficient. We provide theoretical justification by showing that, combined with the convergence guarantees of the FW algorithm, we obtain an approximate solution to the original combinatorial problem upon rounding the relaxed solution to integrality.

      Mathematical reasoning serves as a crucial testbed for evaluating the intelligence of large language models (LLMs), and math word problems (MWPs) represent one of the most widely used formats. Most existing MWP datasets contain only the necessary information, while problems with distracting or excessive conditions are often overlooked. Prior studies have shown that popular LLMs experience a dramatic performance drop when such distracting conditions are introduced. However, available datasets of MWPs with distracting conditions remain limited, and most exhibit low difficulty and out-of-context expressions. These shortcomings make the distracting conditions easy to detect and disregard, thereby reducing the credibility of benchmarking on these datasets. Moreover, when distracting conditions are added, the reasoning process and answers may change, requiring intensive manual effort to check and rewrite solutions. To address these issues, we design an iterative framework that leverages LLMs to generate distracting conditions automatically. We develop a set of prompts to revise MWPs from multiple perspectives and cognitive levels, encouraging the creation of meaningful distracting conditions as well as suggestions for further refinement. A key advantage of our framework is the preservation of shared solutions between the original and revised problems: the LLMs are explicitly guided to generate distractions that do not alter the original solution, thus eliminating the need to produce new answers.

      Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being utilized in various private and commercial applications, e.g., traffic control, parcel delivery, and Search and Rescue (SAR) missions. Machine Learning (ML) methods used in UAV-Assisted Sensor Networks (UASNETs) and, especially, in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) face challenges such as complex and lengthy model training, gaps between simulation and reality, and low sampling efficiency, which conflict with the urgency of emergencies, such as SAR missions. In this paper, an In-Context Learning (ICL)-Data Collection Scheduling (ICLDC) system is proposed as an alternative to DRL in emergencies. The UAV collects sensory data and transmits it to a Large Language Model (LLM), which creates a task description in natural language. From this description, the UAV receives a data collection schedule that must be executed. A verifier ensures safe UAV operations by evaluating the schedules generated by the LLM and overriding unsafe schedules based on predefined rules. The system continuously adapts by incorporating feedback into the task descriptions and using this for future decisions. This method is tested against jailbreaking attacks, where the task description is manipulated to undermine network performance, highlighting the vulnerability of LLMs to such attacks. The proposed ICLDC significantly reduces cumulative packet loss compared to both the DQN and Maximum Channel Gain baselines. ICLDC presents a promising direction for intelligent scheduling and control in UASNETs.

      Large Language Model (LLM) inference has emerged as a fundamental paradigm. In real-world scenarios, variations in output length cause severe workload imbalance in the decode phase, particularly for long-output reasoning tasks. Existing systems, such as PD disaggregation architectures, rely on static prefill-to-decode scheduling, which often results in SLO violations and OOM failures under evolving decode workloads. In this paper, we propose ARES, an adaptive decoding rescheduling system powered by length prediction to anticipate future workloads. Our core contributions include: (1) A lightweight and continuous LLM-native prediction method that leverages LLM hidden state to model remaining generation length with high precision (reducing MAE by 49.42%) and low overhead (cutting predictor parameters by 93.28%); (2) A rescheduling solution in decode phase with : A dynamic balancing mechanism that integrates current and predicted workloads, reducing P99 TPOT by 74.77% and achieving up to 2.24 times higher goodput.

      The emergence of large language models (LLMs) enables the development of intelligent agents capable of engaging in complex and multi-turn dialogues. However, multi-agent collaboration faces critical safety challenges, such as hallucination amplification and error injection and propagation. This paper presents GUARDIAN, a unified method for detecting and mitigating multiple safety concerns in GUARDing Intelligent Agent collaboratioNs. By modeling the multi-agent collaboration process as a discrete-time temporal attributed graph, GUARDIAN explicitly captures the propagation dynamics of hallucinations and errors. The unsupervised encoder-decoder architecture incorporating an incremental training paradigm learns to reconstruct node attributes and graph structures from latent embeddings, enabling the identification of anomalous nodes and edges with unparalleled precision. Moreover, we introduce a graph abstraction mechanism based on the Information Bottleneck Theory, which compresses temporal interaction graphs while preserving essential patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate GUARDIAN's effectiveness in safeguarding LLM multi-agent collaborations against diverse safety vulnerabilities, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with efficient resource utilization.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) can be adapted to extend their text capabilities to speech inputs. However, these speech-adapted LLMs consistently underperform their text-based counterparts--and even cascaded pipelines--on language understanding tasks. We term this shortfall the text-speech understanding gap: the performance drop observed when a speech-adapted LLM processes spoken inputs relative to when the original text-based LLM processes the equivalent text. Recent approaches to narrowing this gap either rely on large-scale speech synthesis of text corpora, which is costly and heavily dependent on synthetic data, or on large-scale proprietary speech datasets, which are not reproducible. As a result, there remains a need for more data-efficient alternatives for closing the text-speech understanding gap. In this work, we analyze the gap as driven by two factors: (i) forgetting of text capabilities during adaptation, and (ii) cross-modal misalignment between speech and text. Based on this analysis, we introduce SALAD--Sample-efficient Alignment with Learning through Active selection and cross-modal Distillation--which combines cross-modal distillation with targeted synthetic data to improve alignment while mitigating forgetting. Applied to 3B and 7B LLMs, SALAD achieves competitive performance with a strong open-weight model across broad-domain benchmarks in knowledge, language understanding, and reasoning, while training on over an order of magnitude less speech data from public corpora.

      Accurate coding of tumor diagnoses with ICD-10-GM and ICD-O-3 is essential for structured cancer documentation in Germany. Smaller open-weight LLMs are appealing for privacy-preserving automation but often struggle with coding accuracy in German-language contexts. This study investigates whether instruction-based fine-tuning on public datasets improves the coding accuracy of open-weight LLMs for German tumor diagnosis texts. The evaluation uses coded diagnoses from the local tumor documentation system as test data. In a systematic data quality assessment, the upper limit for ICD-10 coding performance was estimated at 60-79% for exact and 81-94% for partial (three-character codes only) derivation. As training data, over 500,000 question-answer pairs were created based on the ICD-10-GM, ICD-O-3, and OPS catalogues. Eight open-weight models from the Qwen, Llama, and Mistral families (7-70 B parameters) were fine-tuned. ICD-10-GM accuracy rose from 1.4-24% to 41-58%, and partial accuracy from 31-74% to 73-83%. The accuracy of ICD-O-3 topography coding also improved but started and remained considerably lower with an exact accuracy of 22-40% and a partial accuracy of 56-67% after fine-tuning. Malformed code outputs dropped to 0% for all models. Tumor-diagnosis recognition reached 99%. Accuracy correlated positively with model size, but gaps between small and large models narrowed after fine-tuning. The reasoning mode in Qwen3 generally yielded a lower performance than fine-tuning and was over 100 times slower. Our findings highlight the potential of leveraging public catalogues to build instruction datasets that improve LLMs in medical documentation tasks.

      In finance, Large Language Models (LLMs) face frequent knowledge conflicts arising from discrepancies between their pre-trained parametric knowledge and real-time market data. These conflicts are especially problematic in real-world investment services, where a model's inherent biases can misalign with institutional objectives, leading to unreliable recommendations. Despite this risk, the intrinsic investment biases of LLMs remain underexplored. We propose an experimental framework to investigate emergent behaviors in such conflict scenarios, offering a quantitative analysis of bias in LLM-based investment analysis. Using hypothetical scenarios with balanced and imbalanced arguments, we extract the latent biases of models and measure their persistence. Our analysis, centered on sector, size, and momentum, reveals distinct, model-specific biases. Across most models, a tendency to prefer technology stocks, large-cap stocks, and contrarian strategies is observed. These foundational biases often escalate into confirmation bias, causing models to cling to initial judgments even when faced with increasing counter-evidence.

We assess the performance of an industrial CI system enhanced by four state-of-the-art LLMs, comparing their outcomes with manual corrections provided by human programmers. LLM-equipped CI systems can resolve up to 63 % of the compilation errors in our baseline dataset. Among the fixes associated with successful CI builds, 83 % are deemed reasonable. Moreover, LLMs significantly reduce debugging time, with the majority of successful cases completed within 8 minutes, compared to hours typically required for manual debugging.

      Benchmarking outcomes increasingly govern trust, selection, and deployment of LLMs, yet these evaluations remain vulnerable to semantically equivalent adversarial perturbations. Prior work on adversarial robustness in NLP has emphasized text attacks that affect many models equally, leaving open the question of whether it is possible to selectively degrade or enhance performance while minimally affecting other models. We formalize this problem and study selective adversarial attacks on MMLU - a widely used benchmark designed to measure a language model's broad general knowledge and reasoning ability across different subjects. Using canonical attacks integrated into TextAttack framework, we introduce a protocol for selectivity assessment, develop a custom constraint to increase selectivity of attacks and propose a surrogate-LLM pipeline that generates selective perturbations. Empirically, we find that selective adversarial attacks exist and can materially alter relative rankings, challenging the fairness, reproducibility, and transparency of leaderboard-driven evaluation. Our results motivate perturbation-aware reporting and robustness diagnostics for LLM evaluation and demonstrate that even subtle edits can shift comparative judgments.

      The reasoning pattern of Large language models (LLMs) remains opaque, and Reinforcement learning (RL) typically applies uniform credit across an entire generation, blurring the distinction between pivotal and routine steps. This work positions attention as a privileged substrate that renders the internal logic of LLMs legible, not merely as a byproduct of computation, but as a mechanistic blueprint of reasoning itself. We first distinguish attention heads between locally and globally focused information processing and reveal that locally focused heads produce a sawtooth pattern near the diagonal indicating phrasal chunks, while globally focused heads expose tokens that exert broad downstream influence over future tokens. We formalize these with two metrics: 1) Windowed Average Attention Distance, which measures the extent of backward attention within a clipped window; 2) Future Attention Influence, which quantifies a token's global importance as the average attention it receives from subsequent tokens. Taken together, these signals reveal a recurring preplan-and-anchor mechanism, where the model first performs a long-range contextual reference to generate an introductory token, which is immediately followed by or coincides with a semantic anchor token that organizes subsequent reasoning. Leveraging these insights, we introduce three novel RL strategies that dynamically perform targeted credit assignment to critical nodes (preplan tokens, anchor tokens, and their temporal coupling) and show consistent performance gains across various reasoning tasks. By aligning optimization with the model's intrinsic reasoning rhythm, we aim to transform opaque optimization into an actionable structure-aware process, hoping to offer a potential step toward more transparent and effective optimization of LLM reasoning.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential for complex reasoning, yet their capacity for emergent coordination in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) when operating under strict swarm-like constraints-limited local perception and communication-remains largely unexplored. Existing benchmarks often do not fully capture the unique challenges of decentralized coordination when agents operate with incomplete spatio-temporal information. To bridge this gap, we introduce SwarmBench, a novel benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the swarm intelligence capabilities of LLMs acting as decentralized agents. SwarmBench features five foundational MAS coordination tasks (Pursuit, Synchronization, Foraging, Flocking, Transport) within a configurable 2D grid environment, forcing agents to rely solely on local sensory input ($k\times k$ view) and local communication. We propose metrics for coordination effectiveness and analyze emergent group dynamics. Zero-shot evaluations of leading LLMs (e.g., deepseek-v3, o4-mini) reveal significant task-dependent performance variations. While some rudimentary coordination is observed, our results indicate that current LLMs significantly struggle with robust long-range planning and adaptive strategy formation under the uncertainty inherent in these decentralized scenarios. Assessing LLMs under such swarm-like constraints is crucial for understanding their utility in future decentralized intelligent systems. We release SwarmBench as an open, extensible toolkit-built on a customizable physical system-providing environments, prompts, evaluation scripts, and comprehensive datasets. This aims to foster reproducible research into LLM-based MAS coordination and the theoretical underpinnings of emergent collective behavior under severe informational decentralization.

      Reward models can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but they typically require extensive curated data and costly training. To mitigate these challenges, training-free approaches such as LLM-as-a-Judge leverage the intrinsic reasoning abilities of LLMs to evaluate responses, achieving promising results. Recent works have also indicated that model confidence can serve effectively as a reward metric, distinguishing between chain-of-thought (CoT) and non-CoT paths. However, the concept of using confidence as a reward has not been comprehensively studied. In this work, we systematically investigate Confidence-as-a-Reward (CRew), a simple yet powerful training-free method that utilizes token-level confidence in the model's final answers as a proxy for reward, especially suitable for close-ended tasks. Through extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that CRew outperforms existing training-free reward approaches on the MATH500 and RewardMATH benchmarks, and even surpasses most trained reward models. We further identify a strong correlation between CRew scores and the actual reasoning performance of the model. Additionally, we find that CRew can effectively filter high-quality training data. Building upon these insights, we propose CRew-DPO, a training strategy that constructs preference data from confidence scores combined with correctness signals. Finetuning with CRew-DPO further enhances the model's judging capabilities and consistently outperforms existing self-training methods.

      LLMs hold great promise for healthcare applications, but the rapid evolution of medical knowledge and errors in training data often cause them to generate outdated or inaccurate information, limiting their applicability in high-stakes clinical practice. Model editing has emerged as a potential remedy without full retraining. While parameter-based editing often compromises locality and is thus ill-suited for the medical domain, retrieval-based editing offers a more viable alternative. However, it still faces two critical challenges: (1) representation overlap within the medical knowledge space often causes inaccurate retrieval and reduces editing accuracy; (2) existing methods are restricted to single-sample edits, while batch-editing remains largely unexplored despite its importance for real-world medical applications. To address these challenges, we first construct MedVersa, \hk{an enhanced benchmark with broader coverage of medical subjects, designed to evaluate both single and batch edits under strict locality constraints}. We then propose MedREK, a retrieval-based editing framework that integrates a shared query-key module for precise matching with an attention-based prompt encoder for informative guidance. Experimental results on various medical benchmarks demonstrate that our MedREK achieves superior performance across different core metrics and provides the first validated solution for batch-editing in medical LLMs. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/mylittleriver/MedREK.

      Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly employed for (interactive) decision-making, via the development of LLM-based autonomous agents. Despite their emerging successes, the performance of LLM agents in decision-making has not been fully investigated through quantitative metrics, especially in the multi-agent setting when they interact with each other, a typical scenario in real-world LLM-agent applications. To better understand the limits of LLM agents in these interactive environments, we propose to study their interactions in benchmark decision-making settings in online learning and game theory, through the performance metric of \emph{regret}. We first empirically study the {no-regret} behaviors of LLMs in canonical (non-stationary) online learning problems, as well as the emergence of equilibria when LLM agents interact through playing repeated games. We then provide some theoretical insights into the no-regret behaviors of LLM agents, under certain assumptions on the supervised pre-training and the rationality model of human decision-makers who generate the data. Notably, we also identify (simple) cases where advanced LLMs such as GPT-4 fail to be no-regret. To promote the no-regret behaviors, we propose a novel \emph{unsupervised} training loss of \emph{regret-loss}, which, in contrast to the supervised pre-training loss, does not require the labels of (optimal) actions. We then establish the statistical guarantee of generalization bound for regret-loss minimization, followed by the optimization guarantee that minimizing such a loss may automatically lead to known no-regret learning algorithms. Our further experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our regret-loss, especially in addressing the above ``regrettable'' cases.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) remain static in functionality after training, and extending their capabilities requires integration with external data, computation, and services. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a standard interface for such extensions, but current implementations rely solely on semantic matching between users' requests and server function descriptions, which makes current deployments and simulation testbeds fragile under latency fluctuations or server failures. We address this gap by enhancing MCP tool routing algorithms with real-time awareness of network and server status. To provide a controlled test environment for development and evaluation, we construct a heterogeneous experimental platform, namely Network-aware MCP (NetMCP), which offers five representative network states and build a benchmark for latency sequence generation and MCP server datasets. On top of NetMCP platform, we analyze latency sequences and propose a Semantic-Oriented and Network-Aware Routing (SONAR) algorithm, which jointly optimizes semantic similarity and network Quality of Service (QoS) metrics for adaptive tool routing. Results show that SONAR consistently improves task success rate and reduces completion time and failure number compared with semantic-only, LLM-based baselines, demonstrating the value of network-aware design for production-scale LLM systems.

      How does a cause lead to an effect, and which intermediate causal steps explain their connection? This work scrutinizes the mechanistic causal reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to answer these questions through the task of implicit causal chain discovery. In a diagnostic evaluation framework, we instruct nine LLMs to generate all possible intermediate causal steps linking given cause-effect pairs in causal chain structures. These pairs are drawn from recent resources in argumentation studies featuring polarized discussion on climate change. Our analysis reveals that LLMs vary in the number and granularity of causal steps they produce. Although they are generally self-consistent and confident about the intermediate causal connections in the generated chains, their judgments are mainly driven by associative pattern matching rather than genuine causal reasoning. Nonetheless, human evaluations confirmed the logical coherence and integrity of the generated chains. Our baseline causal chain discovery approach, insights from our diagnostic evaluation, and benchmark dataset with causal chains lay a solid foundation for advancing future work in implicit, mechanistic causal reasoning in argumentation settings.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly prominent for daily tasks, from improving sound-totext translation to generating additional frames for the latest video games. With the help of LLM inference frameworks, such as llama.cpp, which support optimizations such as KV-caching and quantization, it is now easier than ever to deploy LLMs on edge devices. Quantization is fundamental to enable LLMs on resource-constrained edge devices, and llama.cpp utilizes block floating point (BFP) quantization to drastically reduce the bit width of weights and input tensors, the memory footprint, and the computational power required to run LLMs. LLMs are typically quantized with mixed BFP quantization across the model layers to reduce the loss of model accuracy due to quantization. Therefore, to efficiently accelerate across the layers of BFP-quantized LLMs, specialized accelerators need to support different BFP variants without reconfiguration. To address this issue, we propose a Flexible Block FloatingPoint Quantization (F-BFQ) accelerator, which can dynamically switch between two BFP quantization variants and perform matrix multiplication (MatMul) operations. Our initial F-BFQ accelerator design, deployed on the AMD Kria board, reduces inference time by 1.4x on average over the Arm NEON-based CPU execution across three BFP quantized LLMs while achieving 5.2 tokens per second (~3.9 words per second).

      Penetration-testing is crucial for identifying system vulnerabilities, with privilege-escalation being a critical subtask to gain elevated access to protected resources. Language Models (LLMs) presents new avenues for automating these security practices by emulating human behavior. However, a comprehensive understanding of LLMs' efficacy and limitations in performing autonomous Linux privilege-escalation attacks remains under-explored. To address this gap, we introduce hackingBuddyGPT, a fully automated LLM-driven prototype designed for autonomous Linux privilege-escalation. We curated a novel, publicly available Linux privilege-escalation benchmark, enabling controlled and reproducible evaluation. Our empirical analysis assesses the quantitative success rates and qualitative operational behaviors of various LLMs -- GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4-Turbo, and Llama3 -- against baselines of human professional pen-testers and traditional automated tools. We investigate the impact of context management strategies, different context sizes, and various high-level guidance mechanisms on LLM performance. Results show that GPT-4-Turbo demonstrates high efficacy, successfully exploiting 33-83% of vulnerabilities, a performance comparable to human pen-testers (75%). In contrast, local models like Llama3 exhibited limited success (0-33%), and GPT-3.5-Turbo achieved moderate rates (16-50%). We show that both high-level guidance and state-management through LLM-driven reflection significantly boost LLM success rates. Qualitative analysis reveals both LLMs' strengths and weaknesses in generating valid commands and highlights challenges in common-sense reasoning, error handling, and multi-step exploitation, particularly with temporal dependencies. Cost analysis indicates that GPT-4-Turbo can achieve human-comparable performance at competitive costs, especially with optimized context management.

      Recent attempts to integrate large language models (LLMs) into recommender systems have gained momentum, but most remain limited to simple text generation or static prompt-based inference, failing to capture the complexity of user preferences and real-world interactions. This study proposes the Multi-Aspect Driven LLM Agent MADRec, an autonomous LLM-based recommender that constructs user and item profiles by unsupervised extraction of multi-aspect information from reviews and performs direct recommendation, sequential recommendation, and explanation generation. MADRec generates structured profiles via aspect-category-based summarization and applies Re-Ranking to construct high-density inputs. When the ground-truth item is missing from the output, the Self-Feedback mechanism dynamically adjusts the inference criteria. Experiments across multiple domains show that MADRec outperforms traditional and LLM-based baselines in both precision and explainability, with human evaluation further confirming the persuasiveness of the generated explanations.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit factual inconsistencies and logical decay in extended, multi-turn dialogues, a challenge stemming from their reliance on static, pre-trained knowledge and an inability to reason adaptively over the dialogue history. Prevailing mitigation strategies, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and agentic working memories, improve information recall but still engage with fundamentally static knowledge sources and follow pre-defined single reasoning path. This hinders their ability to preserve factual and logical consistency of their responses in multi-turn dialogues while the context evolves over time. To address this issue, we propose D-SMART, a model-agnostic framework designed to maintain multi-turn dialogue consistency by enabling LLMs to build and reason over a dynamic, structured representation of the conversational context. This is achieved via two synergistic components: (1) a Dynamic Structured Memory (DSM), which incrementally constructs and maintains an authoritative, OWL-compliant knowledge graph of the conversation; and (2) a Reasoning Tree (RT), which executes inferences as an explicit and traceable multi-step search over the graph. As the popular-used quality score (judged by GPT-4) can overlook logical flaws, we introduce new NLI-based metrics to better measure multi-turn dialogue consistency. Comprehensive experiments on the MT-Bench-101 benchmark show that D-SMART significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, elevating the dialogue consistency score by over 48\% for both proprietary and open-source models, and notably improves the quality score of the latter by up to 10.1\%.

      Sentiment Analysis (SA) models harbor inherent social biases that can be harmful in real-world applications. These biases are identified by examining the output of SA models for sentences that only vary in the identity groups of the subjects. Constructing natural, linguistically rich, relevant, and diverse sets of sentences that provide sufficient coverage over the domain is expensive, especially when addressing a wide range of biases: it requires domain experts and/or crowd-sourcing. In this paper, we present a novel bias testing framework, BTC-SAM, which generates high-quality test cases for bias testing in SA models with minimal specification using Large Language Models (LLMs) for the controllable generation of test sentences. Our experiments show that relying on LLMs can provide high linguistic variation and diversity in the test sentences, thereby offering better test coverage compared to base prompting methods even for previously unseen biases.

      Process mining has emerged as a powerful analytical technique for understanding complex healthcare workflows. However, its application faces significant barriers, including technical complexity, a lack of standardized approaches, and limited access to practical training resources. We introduce HealthProcessAI, a GenAI framework designed to simplify process mining applications in healthcare and epidemiology by providing a comprehensive wrapper around existing Python (PM4PY) and R (bupaR) libraries. To address unfamiliarity and improve accessibility, the framework integrates multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated process map interpretation and report generation, helping translate technical analyses into outputs that diverse users can readily understand. We validated the framework using sepsis progression data as a proof-of-concept example and compared the outputs of five state-of-the-art LLM models through the OpenRouter platform. To test its functionality, the framework successfully processed sepsis data across four proof-of-concept scenarios, demonstrating robust technical performance and its capability to generate reports through automated LLM analysis. LLM evaluation using five independent LLMs as automated evaluators revealed distinct model strengths: Claude Sonnet-4 and Gemini 2.5-Pro achieved the highest consistency scores (3.79/4.0 and 3.65/4.0) when evaluated by automated LLM assessors. By integrating multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated interpretation and report generation, the framework addresses widespread unfamiliarity with process mining outputs, making them more accessible to clinicians, data scientists, and researchers. This structured analytics and AI-driven interpretation combination represents a novel methodological advance in translating complex process mining results into potentially actionable insights for healthcare applications.

      The increasing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) across enterprise and mission-critical domains has underscored the urgent need for robust guardrailing systems that ensure safety, reliability, and compliance. Existing solutions often struggle with real-time oversight, multi-modal data handling, and explainability -- limitations that hinder their adoption in regulated environments. Existing guardrails largely operate in isolation, focused on text alone making them inadequate for multi-modal, production-scale environments. We introduce Protect, natively multi-modal guardrailing model designed to operate seamlessly across text, image, and audio inputs, designed for enterprise-grade deployment. Protect integrates fine-tuned, category-specific adapters trained via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on an extensive, multi-modal dataset covering four safety dimensions: toxicity, sexism, data privacy, and prompt injection. Our teacher-assisted annotation pipeline leverages reasoning and explanation traces to generate high-fidelity, context-aware labels across modalities. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all safety dimensions, surpassing existing open and proprietary models such as WildGuard, LlamaGuard-4, and GPT-4.1. Protect establishes a strong foundation for trustworthy, auditable, and production-ready safety systems capable of operating across text, image, and audio modalities.

      Computational stylometry analyzes writing style through quantitative patterns in text, supporting applications from forensic tasks such as identity linking and plagiarism detection to literary attribution in the humanities. Supervised and contrastive approaches rely on data with spurious correlations and often confuse style with topic. Despite their natural use in AI-generated text detection, the CLM pre-training of modern LLMs has been scarcely leveraged for general authorship problems. We propose a novel unsupervised approach based on this extensive pre-training and the in-context learning capabilities of LLMs, employing the log-probabilities of an LLM to measure style transferability from one text to another. Our method significantly outperforms LLM prompting approaches of comparable scale and achieves higher accuracy than contrastively trained baselines when controlling for topical correlations. Moreover, performance scales fairly consistently with the size of the base model and, in the case of authorship verification, with an additional mechanism that increases test-time computation; enabling flexible trade-offs between computational cost and accuracy.

      Most recent RL for LLMs (RL4LLM) methods avoid explicit critics, replacing them with average advantage baselines. This shift is largely pragmatic: conventional value functions are computationally expensive to train at LLM scale and often fail under sparse rewards and long reasoning horizons. We revisit this bottleneck from an architectural perspective and introduce Asymmetric Proximal Policy Optimization (AsyPPO), a simple and scalable framework that restores the critics role while remaining efficient in large-model settings. AsyPPO employs a set of lightweight mini-critics, each trained on disjoint prompt shards. This design encourages diversity while preserving calibration, reducing value-estimation bias. Beyond robust estimation, AsyPPO leverages inter-critic uncertainty to refine the policy update: (i) masking advantages in states where critics agree and gradients add little learning signal, and (ii) filtering high-divergence states from entropy regularization, suppressing spurious exploration. After training on open-source data with only 5,000 samples, AsyPPO consistently improves learning stability and performance across multiple benchmarks over strong baselines, such as GRPO, achieving performance gains of more than six percent on Qwen3-4b-Base and about three percent on Qwen3-8b-Base and Qwen3-14b-Base over classic PPO, without additional tricks. These results highlight the importance of architectural innovations for scalable, efficient algorithms.

      Enhancing customer experience is essential for business success, particularly as service demands grow in scale and complexity. Generative artificial intelligence and Large Language Models (LLMs) have empowered intelligent interaction systems to deliver efficient, personalized, and 24/7 support. In practice, intelligent interaction systems encounter several challenges: (1) Constructing high-quality data for cold-start training is difficult, hindering self-evolution and raising labor costs. (2) Multi-turn dialogue performance remains suboptimal due to inadequate intent understanding, rule compliance, and solution extraction. (3) Frequent evolution of business rules affects system operability and transferability, constraining low-cost expansion and adaptability. (4) Reliance on a single LLM is insufficient in complex scenarios, where the absence of multi-agent frameworks and effective collaboration undermines process completeness and service quality. (5) The open-domain nature of multi-turn dialogues, lacking unified golden answers, hampers quantitative evaluation and continuous optimization. To address these challenges, we introduce WOWService, an intelligent interaction system tailored for industrial applications. With the integration of LLMs and multi-agent architectures, WOWService enables autonomous task management and collaborative problem-solving. Specifically, WOWService focuses on core modules including data construction, general capability enhancement, business scenario adaptation, multi-agent coordination, and automated evaluation. Currently, WOWService is deployed on the Meituan App, achieving significant gains in key metrics, e.g., User Satisfaction Metric 1 (USM 1) -27.53% and User Satisfaction Metric 2 (USM 2) +25.51%, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing user needs and advancing personalized service.

      Large language models (LLMs) have achieved striking successes on many benchmarks, yet recent studies continue to expose fundamental weaknesses. In particular, tasks that require abstract reasoning remain challenging, often because they use representations such as grids, symbols, or visual patterns that differ from the natural language data LLMs are trained on. In this paper, we introduce Concept, a simple word-guessing board game, as a benchmark for probing abductive reasoning in a representation that is much closer to LLM pre-training data: natural language. Our results show that this game, easily solved by humans (with a success rate of over 90\%), is still very challenging for state-of-the-art LLMs (no model exceeds 40\% success rate). Specifically, we observe that LLMs struggle with interpreting other players' strategic intents, and with correcting initial hypotheses given sequential information updates. In addition, we extend the evaluation across multiple languages, and find that the LLM performance drops further in lower-resource languages (Dutch, French, and Spanish) compared to English.

      Rule-based network intrusion detection systems play a crucial role in the real-time detection of Web attacks. However, most existing works primarily focus on automatically generating detection rules for new attacks, often overlooking the relationships between new attacks and existing rules, which leads to significant redundancy within the ever-expanding ruleset. To address this issue, we propose GRIDAI, a novel end-to-end framework for the automated Generation and Repair of Intrusion Detection rules through collaboration among multiple LLM-based agents. Unlike traditional methods, GRIDAI first assesses the nature of incoming attack samples. If the sample represents a new attack type, it is used to generate a new rule. Otherwise, the sample is identified as a variant of an attack already covered by an existing rule and used to repair the rule by updating the corresponding signature, thereby enhancing its generalization capability. Additionally, to mitigate syntactic and semantic errors in rules caused by LLM hallucinations, we incorporate a tool-based real-time validation mechanism and a representative attack sample maintained for each rule, enabling fully automated rule generation and repair. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on a public dataset containing seven types of attacks and a private dataset with 43 attack types. The results demonstrate that GRIDAI accurately identifies the relationships between new attack samples and existing rules, efficiently generates and repairs rules to handle new attacks and variants, and effectively mitigates the impact of LLM hallucinations.

      With the increasing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), more customization is needed to ensure privacy-preserving and safe generation. We address this objective from two critical aspects: unlearning of sensitive information and robustness to jail-breaking attacks. We investigate various constrained optimization formulations that address both aspects in a \emph{unified manner}, by finding the smallest possible interventions on LLM weights that either make a given vocabulary set unreachable or embed the LLM with robustness to tailored attacks by shifting part of the weights to a \emph{safer} region. Beyond unifying two key properties, this approach contrasts with previous work in that it doesn't require an oracle classifier that is typically not available or represents a computational overhead. Surprisingly, we find that the simplest point-wise constraint-based intervention we propose leads to better performance than max-min interventions, while having a lower computational cost. Comparison against state-of-the-art defense methods demonstrates superior performance of the proposed approach.

      Network protocol testing is fundamental for modern network infrastructure. However, traditional network protocol testing methods are labor-intensive and error-prone, requiring manual interpretation of specifications, test case design, and translation into executable artifacts, typically demanding one person-day of effort per test case. Existing model-based approaches provide partial automation but still involve substantial manual modeling and expert intervention, leading to high costs and limited adaptability to diverse and evolving protocols. In this paper, we propose a first-of-its-kind system called NeTestLLM that takes advantage of multi-agent Large Language Models (LLMs) for end-to-end automated network protocol testing. NeTestLLM employs hierarchical protocol understanding to capture complex specifications, iterative test case generation to improve coverage, a task-specific workflow for executable artifact generation, and runtime feedback analysis for debugging and refinement. NeTestLLM has been deployed in a production environment for several months, receiving positive feedback from domain experts. In experiments, NeTestLLM generated 4,632 test cases for OSPF, RIP, and BGP, covering 41 historical FRRouting bugs compared to 11 by current national standards. The process of generating executable artifacts also improves testing efficiency by a factor of 8.65x compared to manual methods. NeTestLLM provides the first practical LLM-powered solution for automated end-to-end testing of heterogeneous network protocols.

      The growing scale of evaluation tasks has led to the widespread adoption of automated evaluation using LLMs, a paradigm known as "LLM-as-a-judge". However, improving its alignment with human preferences without complex prompts or fine-tuning remains challenging. Previous studies mainly optimize based on shallow outputs, overlooking rich cross-layer representations. In this work, motivated by preliminary findings that middle-to-upper layers encode semantically and task-relevant representations that are often more aligned with human judgments than the final layer, we propose LAGER, a post-hoc, plug-and-play framework for improving the alignment of LLM-as-a-Judge point-wise evaluations with human scores by leveraging internal representations. LAGER produces fine-grained judgment scores by aggregating cross-layer score-token logits and computing the expected score from a softmax-based distribution, while keeping the LLM backbone frozen and ensuring no impact on the inference process. LAGER fully leverages the complementary information across different layers, overcoming the limitations of relying solely on the final layer. We evaluate our method on the standard alignment benchmarks Flask, HelpSteer, and BIGGen using Spearman correlation, and find that LAGER achieves improvements of up to 7.5% over the best baseline across these benchmarks. Without reasoning steps, LAGER matches or outperforms reasoning-based methods. Experiments on downstream applications, such as data selection and emotional understanding, further show the generalization of LAGER.

      Recommender systems (RecSys) have become critical tools for enhancing user engagement by delivering personalized content across diverse digital platforms. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential for improving RecSys, primarily due to their exceptional generalization capabilities and sophisticated contextual understanding, which facilitate the generation of flexible and interpretable recommendations. However, the direct deployment of LLMs as primary recommendation policies presents notable challenges, including persistent latency issues stemming from frequent API calls and inherent model limitations such as hallucinations and biases. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel offline reinforcement learning (RL) framework that leverages imitation learning from LLM-generated trajectories. Specifically, inverse reinforcement learning is employed to extract robust reward models from LLM demonstrations. This approach negates the need for LLM fine-tuning, thereby substantially reducing computational overhead. Simultaneously, the RL policy is guided by the cumulative rewards derived from these demonstrations, effectively transferring the semantic insights captured by the LLM. Comprehensive experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating superior performance when compared against state-of-the-art RL-based and in-context learning baselines.

      At the core of Deep Research is knowledge mining, the task of extracting structured information from massive unstructured text in response to user instructions. Large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting such instructions but are prohibitively expensive to deploy at scale, while traditional pipelines of classifiers and extractors remain efficient yet brittle and unable to generalize to new tasks. We introduce Falconer, a collaborative framework that combines the agentic reasoning of LLMs with lightweight proxy models for scalable knowledge mining. In Falconer, LLMs act as planners, decomposing user instructions into executable pipelines, and as annotators, generating supervision to train small proxies. The framework unifies classification and extraction into two atomic operations, get label and get span, enabling a single instruction-following model to replace multiple task-specific components. To evaluate the consistency between proxy models incubated by Falconer and annotations provided by humans and large models, we construct new benchmarks covering both planning and end-to-end execution. Experiments show that Falconer closely matches state-of-the-art LLMs in instruction-following accuracy while reducing inference cost by up to 90% and accelerating large-scale knowledge mining by more than 20x, offering an efficient and scalable foundation for Deep Research.

      Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in AI infrastructure, driving the need for high throughput, resource efficient serving systems. Disaggregated LLM serving, which separates prompt prefill from auto-regressive decode, has emerged as a promising architecture by isolating their heterogeneous compute and memory demands. However, current disaggregated systems face three key limitations: (i) static resource allocation cannot adapt to highly dynamic workloads, causing over-provisioning that wastes resources or under-provisioning that violates service level objectives (SLOs); (ii) inherent load imbalance between prefill and decode stages, where prefill is compute-bound and decode is memory-bound, causes under-utilization in one tier while the other becomes a bottleneck; and (iii) prefix cache aware routing skews load distribution, as high cache hit rate prefill nodes attract disproportionately more requests, further degrading balance and efficiency. To address these issues, we present BanaServe, a dynamic orchestration framework that continuously rebalances computational and memory resources across prefill and decode instances while eliminating hotspots induced by cache. BanaServe introduces layer level weight migration, attention level Key Value Cache (KV Cache) migration, and Global KV Cache Store sharing with layer wise overlapped transmission, enabling both coarse grained (layer level) and fine grained (attention level) load redistribution with minimal latency overhead. These mechanisms allow routers to perform purely load aware scheduling, unconstrained by cache placement. Compared to vLLM, BanaServe achieves 1.2x-3.9x higher throughput with 3.9%-78.4% lower total processing time, and outperforms DistServe by 1.1x-2.8x in throughput with 1.4%-70.1% latency reduction.

      Modern IR systems are increasingly tasked with answering complex, multi-faceted queries that require deep reasoning rather than simple keyword or semantic matching. While LLM-based IR has shown great promise, the prevailing retrieve-then-rerank paradigm inherits the limitations of embedding-based retrieval; parametric generative approaches are difficult to update with new information; and long-context methods that place the entire corpus in context are computationally infeasible for large document collections. To address these challenges, we introduce LATTICE, a hierarchical retrieval framework that enables an LLM to reason over and navigate large corpora with logarithmic search complexity by imposing a semantic tree structure on the corpus. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) an offline phase that organizes the corpus into a semantic hierarchy via either a bottom-up agglomerative strategy or a top-down divisive strategy using multi-level summaries and (2) an online traversal phase where a search LLM navigates this tree. A central challenge in such LLM-guided search is that the model's relevance judgments are noisy, context-dependent, and unaware of the hierarchy, making cross-branch and cross-level comparisons difficult. To overcome this, we propose a traversal algorithm that estimates calibrated latent relevance scores from local LLM outputs and aggregates them into a global path relevance metric. Our training-free framework achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on the reasoning-intensive BRIGHT benchmark, demonstrating up to 9% improvement in Recall@100 and 5% in nDCG@10 over the next best zero-shot baseline. Furthermore, compared to the fine-tuned SOTA method DIVER-v2, LATTICE attains comparable results on BRIGHT subsets that use a static corpus for evaluation.

      Bias in AI systems, especially those relying on natural language data, raises ethical and practical concerns. Underrepresentation of certain groups often leads to uneven performance across demographics. Traditional fairness methods, such as pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing, depend on protected-attribute labels, involve accuracy-fairness trade-offs, and may not generalize across datasets. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-Guided Synthetic Augmentation (LGSA), which uses large language models to generate counterfactual examples for underrepresented groups while preserving label integrity. We evaluated LGSA on a controlled dataset of short English sentences with gendered pronouns, professions, and binary classification labels. Structured prompts were used to produce gender-swapped paraphrases, followed by quality control including semantic similarity checks, attribute verification, toxicity screening, and human spot checks. The augmented dataset expanded training coverage and was used to train a classifier under consistent conditions. Results show that LGSA reduces performance disparities without compromising accuracy. The baseline model achieved 96.7 percent accuracy with a 7.2 percent gender bias gap. Simple swap augmentation reduced the gap to 0.7 percent but lowered accuracy to 95.6 percent. LGSA achieved 99.1 percent accuracy with a 1.9 percent bias gap, improving performance on female-labeled examples. These findings demonstrate that LGSA is an effective strategy for bias mitigation, enhancing subgroup balance while maintaining high task accuracy and label fidelity.

      Despite significant recent progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), current MLLMs are challenged by "spatio-temporal" prompts, i.e., prompts that refer to 1) the entirety of an environment encoded in a point cloud that the MLLM should consider; and simultaneously also refer to 2) actions that happened in part of the environment and are encoded in a short ego-centric video clip. However, such a holistic spatio-temporal understanding is important for agents operating in the real world. To address this challenge, we first develop a framework to collect a large-scale dataset. Using the collected "Reasoning about Environments and Actions" (REA) dataset, we show that recent MLLMs indeed struggle to correctly answer "spatio-temporal" prompts. Building on this dataset, we study two spatio-temporal LLM (STLLM) baselines: 1) STLLM-3D, which directly fuses point cloud, video, and text representations as inputs to the LLM; and 2) STLLM-Aligner, which aligns spatial context with video and text before LLM decoding. Both baselines aim to enhance spatial understanding of environments and temporal grounding of egocentric observations. On REA, the STLLM baselines outperform existing models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our designs. Code and data are available at https://zoezheng126.github.io/STLLM-website/.

      The advent of large language models (LLMs) has enabled agents to represent virtual humans in societal simulations, facilitating diverse interactions within complex social systems. However, existing LLM-based agents exhibit severe limitations in affective cognition: They fail to simulate the bounded rationality essential for bridging virtual and real-world services; They lack empirically validated integration mechanisms embedding emotions within agent decision architectures. This paper constructs an emotional cognition framework incorporating desire generation and objective management, designed to achieve emotion alignment between LLM-based agents and humans, modeling the complete decision-making process of LLM-based agents, encompassing state evolution, desire generation, objective optimization, decision generation, and action execution. This study implements the proposed framework within our proprietary multi-agent interaction environment. Experimental results demonstrate that agents governed by our framework not only exhibit behaviors congruent with their emotional states but also, in comparative assessments against other agent types, demonstrate superior ecological validity and generate decision outcomes that significantly more closely approximate human behavioral patterns.

      Knowledge graphs (KGs), with their structured representation capabilities, offer promising avenue for enhancing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, leading to the development of KG-RAG systems. Nevertheless, existing methods often struggle to achieve effective synergy between system effectiveness and cost efficiency, leading to neither unsatisfying performance nor excessive LLM prompt tokens and inference time. To this end, this paper proposes REMINDRAG, which employs an LLM-guided graph traversal featuring node exploration, node exploitation, and, most notably, memory replay, to improve both system effectiveness and cost efficiency. Specifically, REMINDRAG memorizes traversal experience within KG edge embeddings, mirroring the way LLMs "memorize" world knowledge within their parameters, but in a train-free manner. We theoretically and experimentally confirm the effectiveness of REMINDRAG, demonstrating its superiority over existing baselines across various benchmark datasets and LLM backbones.

      Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a complex neurodegenerative disorder, requires analysis of heterogeneous biomarkers (e.g., neuroimaging, genetic risk factors, cognitive tests, and cerebrospinal fluid proteins) typically represented in a tabular format. With flexible few-shot reasoning, multimodal integration, and natural-language-based interpretability, large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities for prediction with structured biomedical data. We propose a novel framework called TAP-GPT, Tabular Alzheimer's Prediction GPT, that adapts TableGPT2, a multimodal tabular-specialized LLM originally developed for business intelligence tasks, for AD diagnosis using structured biomarker data with small sample sizes. Our approach constructs few-shot tabular prompts using in-context learning examples from structured biomedical data and finetunes TableGPT2 using the parameter-efficient qLoRA adaption for a clinical binary classification task of AD or cognitively normal (CN). The TAP-GPT framework harnesses the powerful tabular understanding ability of TableGPT2 and the encoded prior knowledge of LLMs to outperform more advanced general-purpose LLMs and a tabular foundation model (TFM) developed for prediction tasks. To our knowledge, this is the first application of LLMs to the prediction task using tabular biomarker data, paving the way for future LLM-driven multi-agent frameworks in biomedical informatics.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by using a draft model to look ahead, but gains are capped by the cost of autoregressive draft generation: increasing draft size elevates acceptance rates but introduces additional latency overhead exacerbating the speed-accuracy tradeoff. Prior methods (Medusa, Hydra, EAGLE) partially reduce draft cost but either degrade acceptance or introduce overheads that limit scaling. We present Mirror Speculative Decoding (Mirror-SD), an inference algorithm that breaks the latency-acceptance tradeoff. Mirror-SD launches branch-complete rollouts from early-exit signals in parallel with the target model's suffix and explicitly maps computation across heterogeneous accelerators (GPU and NPU) to exploit cross-device parallelism. The draft speculates forward continuations for the target to verify, while the target simultaneously speculates correction paths for the draft, converting speculation into two complementary execution pipelines. To further cut draft latency without weakening acceptance semantics, we add speculative streaming so the draft emits multiple tokens per step. This dual strategy of parallel heterogeneous execution plus multi-token speculative streaming pushes speculative decoding toward its ideal regime of high acceptance with low overhead. On SpecBench with server-scale models from 14B to 66B parameters, Mirror-SD delivers consistent end-to-end gains, achieving 2.8x-5.8x wall-time speedups across diverse tasks and a 30% average relative improvement over the strongest baseline, EAGLE3.
