      Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as rerankers in information retrieval, yet their ranking behavior can be steered by small, natural-sounding prompts. To expose this vulnerability, we present Rank Anything First (RAF), a two-stage token optimization method that crafts concise textual perturbations to consistently promote a target item in LLM-generated rankings while remaining hard to detect. Stage 1 uses Greedy Coordinate Gradient to shortlist candidate tokens at the current position by combining the gradient of the rank-target with a readability score; Stage 2 evaluates those candidates under exact ranking and readability losses using an entropy-based dynamic weighting scheme, and selects a token via temperature-controlled sampling. RAF generates ranking-promoting prompts token-by-token, guided by dual objectives: maximizing ranking effectiveness and preserving linguistic naturalness. Experiments across multiple LLMs show that RAF significantly boosts the rank of target items using naturalistic language, with greater robustness than existing methods in both promoting target items and maintaining naturalness. These findings underscore a critical security implication: LLM-based reranking is inherently susceptible to adversarial manipulation, raising new challenges for the trustworthiness and robustness of modern retrieval systems.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Current evaluations of sentence embedding models typically rely on static test beds such as the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). While invaluable, repeated tuning on a fixed suite can inflate reported performance and obscure real-world robustness. We introduce the Paraphrasing Text Embedding Benchmark (PTEB), a dynamic protocol that stochastically generates meaning-preserving paraphrases at evaluation time and aggregates results across multiple runs. Using a cost-efficient LLM-based method grounded in semantic textual similarity gold ratings, we show that LLMs generate token-diverse but semantically preserving, paraphrases. Across 7 MTEB tasks, we validate our hypothesis that the performance of sentence encoders is sensitive to changes in token space even when semantics remain fixed. We also observe that smaller models are not disproportionately affected relative to larger ones. Our results are statistically robust over multiple runs and we extended our experiments to 3 multilingual datasets covering 10 languages. More generally, we aim to propose a new evaluation paradigm in NLP that relies less on static, pre-defined benchmarks but shifts towards dynamic, stochastic evaluation leveraging eval-time compute.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      We study reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language model (LLM) agents for long-horizon multi-turn tool use, where context length quickly becomes a fundamental bottleneck. Existing RL pipelines can suffer from degraded instruction following, excessive rollout costs, and most importantly, strict context limits. To address these challenges, we introduce summarization-based context management to training. In specific, it periodically compresses the tool using history by LLM-generated summaries that retain task-relevant information to keep a compact context while enabling the agent to scale beyond the fixed context window. Building on this formulation, we derive a policy gradient representation that seamlessly enables standard LLM RL infrastructures to optimize both tool-use behaviors as well as summarization strategies in an end-to-end fashion. We instantiate this framework with \underline{SU}mmarization augmented \underline{P}olicy \underline{O}ptimization (\texttt{SUPO}), an LLM RL algorithm that enables long-horizon training beyond a fixed context limit. Experiments on interactive function calling and searching tasks demonstrate that \texttt{SUPO} significantly improves the success rate while maintaining the same or even lower working context length compared to baselines. We also demonstrate that for complex searching tasks, \texttt{SUPO} can further improve the evaluation performance when scaling test-time maximum round of summarization beyond that of training time. Our results establish summarization-based context management as a principled and scalable approach for training RL agents beyond a fixed context length limit.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant disparities in performance across languages, primarily benefiting high-resource languages while marginalizing underrepresented ones. Continual Pretraining (CPT) has emerged as a promising approach to address this imbalance, although the relative effectiveness of monolingual, bilingual, and code-augmented data strategies remains unclear. This study systematically evaluates 36 CPT configurations involving three multilingual base models, across 30+ languages categorized as altruistic, selfish, and stagnant, spanning various resource levels. Our findings reveal three major insights: (1) Bilingual CPT improves multilingual classification but often causes language mixing issues during generation. (2) Including programming code data during CPT consistently enhances multilingual classification accuracy, particularly benefiting low-resource languages, but introduces a trade-off by slightly degrading generation quality. (3) Contrary to prior work, we observe substantial deviations from language classifications according to their impact on cross-lingual transfer: Languages classified as altruistic often negatively affect related languages, selfish languages show conditional and configuration-dependent behavior, and stagnant languages demonstrate surprising adaptability under certain CPT conditions. These nuanced interactions emphasize the complexity of multilingual representation learning, underscoring the importance of systematic studies on generalizable language classification to inform future multilingual CPT strategies.

      Systematic reviews are a standard practice for summarizing the state of evidence in software engineering. Conducting systematic reviews is laborious, especially during the screening or study selection phase, where the number of papers can be overwhelming. During this phase, papers are assessed against inclusion and exclusion criteria based on their titles and abstracts. Recent research has demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) can perform title-abstract screening at a level comparable to that of a master's student. While LLMs cannot be fully trusted, they can help, for example, in Rapid Reviews, which try to expedite the review process. Building on recent research, we developed AiSysRev, an LLM-based screening tool implemented as a web application running in a Docker container. The tool accepts a CSV file containing paper titles and abstracts. Users specify inclusion and exclusion criteria. One can use multiple LLMs for screening via OpenRouter. AiSysRev supports both zero-shot and few-shot screening, and also allows for manual screening through interfaces that display LLM results as guidance for human reviewers.We conducted a trial study with 137 papers using the tool. Our findings indicate that papers can be classified into four categories: Easy Includes, Easy Excludes, Boundary Includes, and Boundary Excludes. The Boundary cases, where LLMs are prone to errors, highlight the need for human intervention. While LLMs do not replace human judgment in systematic reviews, they can significantly reduce the burden of assessing large volumes of scientific literature.

      Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to recognize novel concepts from only a few labeled support samples. Recent studies enhance support features by incorporating additional semantic information or designing complex semantic fusion modules. However, they still suffer from hallucinating semantics that contradict the visual evidence due to the lack of grounding in actual instances, resulting in noisy guidance and costly corrections. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework, bridging Vision and Text with LLMs for Few-Shot Learning (VT-FSL), which constructs precise cross-modal prompts conditioned on Large Language Models (LLMs) and support images, seamlessly integrating them through a geometry-aware alignment. It mainly consists of Cross-modal Iterative Prompting (CIP) and Cross-modal Geometric Alignment (CGA). Specifically, the CIP conditions an LLM on both class names and support images to generate precise class descriptions iteratively in a single structured reasoning pass. These descriptions not only enrich the semantic understanding of novel classes but also enable the zero-shot synthesis of semantically consistent images. The descriptions and synthetic images act respectively as complementary textual and visual prompts, providing high-level class semantics and low-level intra-class diversity to compensate for limited support data. Furthermore, the CGA jointly aligns the fused textual, support, and synthetic visual representations by minimizing the kernelized volume of the 3-dimensional parallelotope they span. It captures global and nonlinear relationships among all representations, enabling structured and consistent multimodal integration. The proposed VT-FSL method establishes new state-of-the-art performance across ten diverse benchmarks, including standard, cross-domain, and fine-grained few-shot learning scenarios.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      In recent years, the growing interest in Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced prompt engineering, transitioning from manual design to model-based optimization. Prompts for LLMs generally comprise two components: the \textit{instruction}, which defines the task or objective, and the \textit{input}, which is tailored to the instruction type. In natural language generation (NLG) tasks such as machine translation, the \textit{input} component is particularly critical, while the \textit{instruction} component tends to be concise. Existing prompt engineering methods primarily focus on optimizing the \textit{instruction} component for general tasks, often requiring large-parameter LLMs as auxiliary tools. However, these approaches exhibit limited applicability for tasks like machine translation, where the \textit{input} component plays a more pivotal role. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a novel prompt optimization method specifically designed for machine translation tasks. The proposed approach employs a small-parameter model trained using a back-translation-based strategy, significantly reducing training overhead for single-task optimization while delivering highly effective performance. With certain adaptations, this method can also be extended to other downstream tasks.

      We introduce an Agent-in-the-Loop (AITL) framework that implements a continuous data flywheel for iteratively improving an LLM-based customer support system. Unlike standard offline approaches that rely on batch annotations, AITL integrates four key types of annotations directly into live customer operations: (1) pairwise response preferences, (2) agent adoption and rationales, (3) knowledge relevance checks, and (4) identification of missing knowledge. These feedback signals seamlessly feed back into models' updates, reducing retraining cycles from months to weeks. Our production pilot involving US-based customer support agents demonstrated significant improvements in retrieval accuracy (+11.7% recall@75, +14.8% precision@8), generation quality (+8.4% helpfulness) and agent adoption rates (+4.5%). These results underscore the effectiveness of embedding human feedback loops directly into operational workflows to continuously refine LLM-based customer support system.

      Large-scale public deliberations generate thousands of free-form contributions that must be synthesized into representative and neutral summaries for policy use. While LLMs have been shown as a promising tool to generate summaries for large-scale deliberations, they also risk underrepresenting minority perspectives and exhibiting bias with respect to the input order, raising fairness concerns in high-stakes contexts. Studying and fixing these issues requires a comprehensive evaluation at a large scale, yet current practice often relies on LLMs as judges, which show weak alignment with human judgments. To address this, we present DeliberationBank, a large-scale human-grounded dataset with (1) opinion data spanning ten deliberation questions created by 3,000 participants and (2) summary judgment data annotated by 4,500 participants across four dimensions (representativeness, informativeness, neutrality, policy approval). Using these datasets, we train DeliberationJudge, a fine-tuned DeBERTa model that can rate deliberation summaries from individual perspectives. DeliberationJudge is more efficient and more aligned with human judgements compared to a wide range of LLM judges. With DeliberationJudge, we evaluate 18 LLMs and reveal persistent weaknesses in deliberation summarization, especially underrepresentation of minority positions. Our framework provides a scalable and reliable way to evaluate deliberation summarization, helping ensure AI systems are more representative and equitable for policymaking.

      While the recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have successfully enabled generative recommenders with natural language interactions, their recommendation behavior is limited, leaving other simpler yet crucial components such as metadata or attribute filtering underutilized in the system. We propose an LLM-based music recommendation system with tool calling to serve as a unified retrieval-reranking pipeline. Our system positions an LLM as an end-to-end recommendation system that interprets user intent, plans tool invocations, and orchestrates specialized components: boolean filters (SQL), sparse retrieval (BM25), dense retrieval (embedding similarity), and generative retrieval (semantic IDs). Through tool planning, the system predicts which types of tools to use, their execution order, and the arguments needed to find music matching user preferences, supporting diverse modalities while seamlessly integrating multiple database filtering methods. We demonstrate that this unified tool-calling framework achieves competitive performance across diverse recommendation scenarios by selectively employing appropriate retrieval methods based on user queries, envisioning a new paradigm for conversational music recommendation systems.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Since 2020, automated testing for Database Management Systems (DBMSs) has flourished, uncovering hundreds of bugs in widely-used systems. A cornerstone of these techniques is test oracle, which typically implements a mechanism to generate equivalent query pairs, thereby identifying bugs by checking the consistency between their results. However, while applying these oracles can be automated, their design remains a fundamentally manual endeavor. This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to automate the discovery and instantiation of test oracles, addressing a long-standing bottleneck towards fully automated DBMS testing. Although LLMs demonstrate impressive creativity, they are prone to hallucinations that can produce numerous false positive bug reports. Furthermore, their significant monetary cost and latency mean that LLM invocations should be limited to ensure that bug detection is efficient and economical. To this end, we introduce Argus, a novel framework built upon the core concept of the Constrained Abstract Query - a SQL skeleton containing placeholders and their associated instantiation conditions (e.g., requiring a placeholder to be filled by a boolean column). Argus uses LLMs to generate pairs of these skeletons that are asserted to be semantically equivalent. This equivalence is then formally proven using a SQL equivalence solver to ensure soundness. Finally, the placeholders within the verified skeletons are instantiated with concrete, reusable SQL snippets that are also synthesized by LLMs to efficiently produce complex test cases. We implemented Argus and evaluated it on five extensively tested DBMSs, discovering 40 previously unknown bugs, 35 of which are logic bugs, with 36 confirmed and 26 already fixed by the developers.

      Many evaluations of large language models (LLMs) in text annotation focus primarily on the correctness of the output, typically comparing model-generated labels to human-annotated ``ground truth'' using standard performance metrics. In contrast, our study moves beyond effectiveness alone. We aim to explore how labeling decisions -- by both humans and LLMs -- can be statistically evaluated across individuals. Rather than treating LLMs purely as annotation systems, we approach LLMs as an alternative annotation mechanism that may be capable of mimicking the subjective judgments made by humans. To assess this, we develop a statistical evaluation method based on Krippendorff's $\alpha$, paired bootstrapping, and the Two One-Sided t-Tests (TOST) equivalence test procedure. This evaluation method tests whether an LLM can blend into a group of human annotators without being distinguishable. We apply this approach to two datasets -- MovieLens 100K and PolitiFact -- and find that the LLM is statistically indistinguishable from a human annotator in the former ($p = 0.004$), but not in the latter ($p = 0.155$), highlighting task-dependent differences. It also enables early evaluation on a small sample of human data to inform whether LLMs are suitable for large-scale annotation in a given application.

      This paper presents a case study on deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) as an advanced "annotation" mechanism to achieve nuanced content understanding (e.g., discerning content "vibe") at scale within a large-scale industrial short-form video recommendation system. Traditional machine learning classifiers for content understanding face protracted development cycles and a lack of deep, nuanced comprehension. The "LLM-as-annotators" approach addresses these by significantly shortening development times and enabling the annotation of subtle attributes. This work details an end-to-end workflow encompassing: (1) iterative definition and robust evaluation of target attributes, refined by offline metrics and online A/B testing; (2) scalable offline bulk annotation of video corpora using LLMs with multimodal features, optimized inference, and knowledge distillation for broad application; and (3) integration of these rich annotations into the online recommendation serving system, for example, through personalized restrict retrieval. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, with LLMs outperforming human raters in offline annotation quality for nuanced attributes and yielding significant improvements of user participation and satisfied consumption in online A/B tests. The study provides insights into designing and scaling production-level LLM pipelines for rich content evaluation, highlighting the adaptability and benefits of LLM-generated nuanced understanding for enhancing content discovery, user satisfaction, and the overall effectiveness of modern recommendation systems.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      In large-scale industrial LLM systems, prompt templates often expand to thousands of tokens as teams iteratively incorporate sections such as task instructions, few-shot examples, and heuristic rules to enhance robustness and coverage. This expansion leads to bloated prompts that are difficult to maintain and incur significant inference latency and serving costs. To address this, we introduce Prompt Compression via Attribution Estimation (ProCut), a flexible, LLM-agnostic, training-free framework that compresses prompts through attribution analysis. ProCut segments prompt templates into semantically meaningful units, quantifies their impact on task performance, and prunes low-utility components. Through extensive experiments on five public benchmark datasets and real-world industrial prompts, we show that ProCut achieves substantial prompt size reductions (78% fewer tokens in production) while maintaining or even slightly improving task performance (up to 62% better than alternative methods). We further introduce an LLM-driven attribution estimator that reduces compression latency by over 50%, and demonstrate that ProCut integrates seamlessly with existing prompt-optimization frameworks to produce concise, high-performing prompts.

      Large language models (LLMs) based Recommender Systems (RecSys) can flexibly adapt recommendation systems to different domains. It utilizes in-context learning (ICL), i.e., the prompts, to customize the recommendation functions, which include sensitive historical user-specific item interactions, e.g., implicit feedback like clicked items or explicit product reviews. Such private information may be exposed to novel privacy attack. However, no study has been done on this important issue. We design four membership inference attacks (MIAs), aiming to reveal whether victims' historical interactions have been used by system prompts. They are \emph{direct inquiry, hallucination, similarity, and poisoning attacks}, each of which utilizes the unique features of LLMs or RecSys. We have carefully evaluated them on three LLMs that have been used to develop ICL-LLM RecSys and two well-known RecSys benchmark datasets. The results confirm that the MIA threat on LLM RecSys is realistic: direct inquiry and poisoning attacks showing significantly high attack advantages. We have also analyzed the factors affecting these attacks, such as the number of shots in system prompts and the position of the victim in the shots.

      Reinforcement learning (RL) has become central to enhancing reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Yet on-policy algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) often suffer in early training: noisy gradients from low-quality rollouts lead to unstable updates and inefficient exploration. We introduce Slow-Fast Policy Optimization (SFPO), a simple yet efficient framework to address these limitations via decomposing each step into three stages: a short fast trajectory of inner steps on the same batch, a reposition mechanism to control off-policy drift, and a final slow correction. This reposition-before-update design preserves the objective and rollout process unchanged, making SFPO plug-compatible with existing policy-gradient pipelines. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SFPO consistently improves stability, reduces rollouts, and accelerates convergence of reasoning RL training. Specifically, it outperforms GRPO by up to 2.80 points in average on math reasoning benchmarks. It also achieves up to 4.93\texttimes{} fewer rollouts and an up to 4.19\texttimes{} reduction in wall-clock time to match GRPO's best accuracy.

      Temporal reasoning is pivotal for Large Language Models (LLMs) to comprehend the real world. However, existing works neglect the real-world challenges for temporal reasoning: (1) intensive temporal information, (2) fast-changing event dynamics, and (3) complex temporal dependencies in social interactions. To bridge this gap, we propose a multi-level benchmark TIME, designed for temporal reasoning in real-world scenarios. TIME consists of 38,522 QA pairs, covering 3 levels with 11 fine-grained sub-tasks. This benchmark encompasses 3 sub-datasets reflecting different real-world challenges: TIME-Wiki, TIME-News, and TIME-Dial. We conduct extensive experiments on reasoning models and non-reasoning models. And we conducted an in-depth analysis of temporal reasoning performance across diverse real-world scenarios and tasks, and summarized the impact of test-time scaling on temporal reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we release TIME-Lite, a human-annotated subset to foster future research and standardized evaluation in temporal reasoning.

      Although Large Language Models have demonstrated powerful capabilities in a wide range of tasks such as language understanding and code generation, the frequent occurrence of hallucinations during the generation process has become a significant impediment to their deployment in critical application scenarios. Current mainstream hallucination detection methods rely on factual consistency verification or static hidden layer features. The former is constrained by the scope of knowledge coverage, while the latter struggles to capture reasoning biases during the inference process. To address these issues, and inspired by signal analysis methods in cognitive neuroscience, this paper proposes a hallucination detection method based on the frequency-domain analysis of hidden layer temporal signals, named HSAD (\textbf{H}idden \textbf{S}ignal \textbf{A}nalysis-based \textbf{D}etection). First, by treating the LLM's reasoning process as a cognitive journey that unfolds over time, we propose modeling and simulating the human process of signal perception and discrimination in a deception-detection scenario through hidden layer temporal signals. Next, The Fast Fourier Transform is applied to map these temporal signals into the frequency domain to construct spectral features, which are used to capture anomalies that arise during the reasoning process; analysis experiments on these spectral features have proven the effectiveness of this approach. Finally, a hallucination detection algorithm is designed based on these spectral features to identify hallucinations in the generated content. By effectively combining the modeling of the reasoning process with frequency-domain feature extraction, the HSAD method overcomes the limitations of existing approaches in terms of knowledge coverage and the detection of reasoning biases, demonstrating higher detection accuracy and robustness.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      The substantial investment required to develop Large Language Models (LLMs) makes them valuable intellectual property, raising significant concerns about copyright protection. LLM fingerprinting has emerged as a key technique to address this, which aims to verify a model's origin by extracting an intrinsic, unique signature (a "fingerprint") and comparing it to that of a source model to identify illicit copies. However, existing black-box fingerprinting methods often fail to generate distinctive LLM fingerprints. This ineffectiveness arises because black-box methods typically rely on model outputs, which lose critical information about the model's unique parameters due to the usage of non-linear functions. To address this, we first leverage Fisher Information Theory to formally demonstrate that the gradient of the model's input is a more informative feature for fingerprinting than the output. Based on this insight, we propose ZeroPrint, a novel method that approximates these information-rich gradients in a black-box setting using zeroth-order estimation. ZeroPrint overcomes the challenge of applying this to discrete text by simulating input perturbations via semantic-preserving word substitutions. This operation allows ZeroPrint to estimate the model's Jacobian matrix as a unique fingerprint. Experiments on the standard benchmark show ZeroPrint achieves a state-of-the-art effectiveness and robustness, significantly outperforming existing black-box methods.

      Jailbreaking large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a pressing concern with the increasing prevalence and accessibility of conversational LLMs. Adversarial users often exploit these models through carefully engineered prompts to elicit restricted or sensitive outputs, a strategy widely referred to as jailbreaking. While numerous defense mechanisms have been proposed, attackers continuously develop novel prompting techniques, and no existing model can be considered fully resistant. In this study, we investigate the jailbreak phenomenon by examining the internal representations of LLMs, with a focus on how hidden layers respond to jailbreak versus benign prompts. Specifically, we analyze the open-source LLM GPT-J and the state-space model Mamba2, presenting preliminary findings that highlight distinct layer-wise behaviors. Our results suggest promising directions for further research on leveraging internal model dynamics for robust jailbreak detection and defense.

      Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has improved the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by using rule-based binary feedback. However, current RLVR methods typically assign the same reward to every token. This coarse-grained feedback hampers precise credit assignment, making it hard for models to identify which reasoning steps lead to success or failure, and often results in suboptimal policies. Methods like PPO provide credit assignment by value estimation, but yield inaccurate and unverifiable signals due to limited sampling. On the other hand, methods using Process Reward Models can provide step-wise rewards but suffer from several key limitations: they require high-quality process supervision labels, the feedback is unreliable due to probabilistic reward modeling, and their application in online reinforcement learning (RL) is time-consuming. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a simple but efficient method-Credit Assignment Policy Optimization (CAPO). Instead of training auxiliary models, CAPO directly leverages an off-the-shelf, general-purpose LLM as a Generative Process Reward Model (LLM-as-GenPRM) to generate all step-wise critique by one pass only based on the correctness of the step itself, providing deterministic token-level credits to refine the tokens that were originally assigned identical rule-based rewards. To further enhance the accuracy and robustness, we employ voting mechanisms that scale with the number of generated critiques. Extensive experiments on various backbones like Llama and Qwen models show that CAPO consistently outperforms supervised learning-based and RL-based fine-tuning methods across four challenging mathematical benchmarks and three out-of-domain benchmarks. Further analysis shows that CAPO can help the model to foster the learning of correct reasoning pathways leading to correct answers.

      In this paper, we introduce a systematic framework beyond conventional method to assess LLMs' mathematical-reasoning robustness by stress-testing them on advanced math problems that are mathematically equivalent but with linguistic and parametric variation. These transformations allow us to measure the sensitivity of LLMs to non-mathematical perturbations, thereby enabling a more accurate evaluation of their mathematical reasoning capabilities. Using this new evaluation methodology, we created PutnamGAP, a new benchmark dataset with multiple mathematically-equivalent variations of competition-level math problems. With the new dataset, we evaluate multiple families of representative LLMs and examine their robustness. Across 18 commercial and open-source models we observe sharp performance degradation on the variants. OpenAI's flagship reasoning model, O3, scores 51.5% on the originals but drops by 4.7 percentage points on surface-renaming variants, and by 12.9 percentage points on parametric variants, while smaller models fare far worse. Overall, the results show that the proposed new evaluation methodology is effective for deepening our understanding of the robustness of LLMs and generating new insights for further improving their mathematical reasoning capabilities.

      With the rapid progress of LLMs, high quality generative text has become widely available as a cover for text steganography. However, prevailing methods rely on hand-crafted or pre-specified strategies and struggle to balance efficiency, imperceptibility, and security, particularly at high embedding rates. Accordingly, we propose Auto-Stega, an agent-driven self-evolving framework that is the first to realize self-evolving steganographic strategies by automatically discovering, composing, and adapting strategies at inference time; the framework operates as a closed loop of generating, evaluating, summarizing, and updating that continually curates a structured strategy library and adapts across corpora, styles, and task constraints. A decoding LLM recovers the information under the shared strategy. To handle high embedding rates, we introduce PC-DNTE, a plug-and-play algorithm that maintains alignment with the base model's conditional distribution at high embedding rates, preserving imperceptibility while enhancing security. Experimental results demonstrate that at higher embedding rates Auto-Stega achieves superior performance with gains of 42.2\% in perplexity and 1.6\% in anti-steganalysis performance over SOTA methods.

APE incorporates a confidence-based ensemble mechanism to decide when to adopt the judgments from additional evaluation dimensions through a novel confidence estimation approach called Collective Confidence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that APE improves the reliability of LLM Judge across diverse standard benchmarks. For instance, APE enhances GPT-4o agreement rate on Reward Bench from 87.2% to 90.5% in the zero-shot setting.

      The quality and experience of mobile communication have significantly improved with the introduction of 5G, and these improvements are expected to continue beyond the 5G era. However, vulnerabilities in control-plane protocols, such as Radio Resource Control (RRC) and Non-Access Stratum (NAS), pose significant security threats, such as Blind Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Despite the availability of existing anomaly detection methods that leverage rule-based systems or traditional machine learning methods, these methods have several limitations, including the need for extensive training data, predefined rules, and limited explainability. Addressing these challenges, we propose a novel anomaly detection framework that leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in zero-shot mode with unordered data and short natural language attack descriptions within the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture. We analyse robustness to prompt variation, demonstrate the practicality of automating the attack descriptions and show that detection quality relies on the semantic completeness of the description rather than its phrasing or length. We utilise an RRC/NAS dataset to evaluate the solution and provide an extensive comparison of open-source and proprietary LLM implementations to demonstrate superior performance in attack detection. We further validate the practicality of our framework within O-RAN's real-time constraints, illustrating its potential for detecting other Layer-3 attacks.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-turn conversational applications, where the management of the Key-Value (KV) Cache presents a significant bottleneck. The linear growth of the KV Cache with dialogue history imposes substantial computational costs, and existing eviction strategies often degrade performance by repeatedly compressing early conversational context, leading to information loss and context forgetting. This paper introduces FlowKV, a novel \textbf{multi-turn isolation mechanism} for KV Cache management, which can be applied to any KV Cache compression method without training. FlowKV's core innovation is a multi-turn isolation mechanism that preserves the accumulated compressed KV cache from past turns. Compression is then strategically applied only to the newly generated KV pairs of the latest completed turn, effectively preventing the re-compression of older context and thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Our results demonstrate that FlowKV consistently and significantly outperforms baseline strategies in maintaining instruction-following accuracy and user preference retention from 10.90\% to 75.40\%, particularly in later conversational turns.

      Machine unlearning for large language models (LLMs) aims to remove undesired data, knowledge, and behaviors (e.g., for safety, privacy, or copyright) while preserving useful model capabilities. Despite rapid progress over the past two years, research in LLM unlearning remains fragmented, with limited clarity on what constitutes effective unlearning and how it should be rigorously evaluated. In this work, we present a principled taxonomy of twelve recent stateful unlearning methods, grouped into three methodological families: divergence-driven optimization, representation misalignment, and rejection-based targeted unlearning. Building on this taxonomy, we revisit the evaluation of unlearning effectiveness (UE), utility retention (UT), and robustness (Rob), focusing on the WMDP benchmark. Our analysis shows that current evaluations, dominated by multiple-choice question (MCQ) accuracy, offer only a narrow perspective, often overstating success while overlooking the model's actual generation behavior. To address this gap, we introduce open question-answering (Open-QA) metrics that better capture generative performance and reveal the inherent UE-UT tradeoff across method families. Furthermore, we demonstrate that robustness requires finer-grained analysis: for example, vulnerabilities differ substantially between in-domain relearning and out-of-domain fine-tuning, even though both fall under model-level attacks. Through this study, we hope to deliver a full-stack revisit of LLM unlearning and actionable guidance for designing and evaluating future methods.

      Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in long-form, knowledge-grounded role-play dialogues remains challenging. This study compares LLM-generated and human-authored responses in multi-turn professional training simulations through human evaluation ($N=38$) and automated LLM-as-a-judge assessment. Human evaluation revealed significant degradation in LLM-generated response quality across turns, particularly in naturalness, context maintenance and overall quality, while human-authored responses progressively improved. In line with this finding, participants also indicated a consistent preference for human-authored dialogue. These human judgements were validated by our automated LLM-as-a-judge evaluation, where Gemini 2.0 Flash achieved strong alignment with human evaluators on both zero-shot pairwise preference and stochastic 6-shot construct ratings, confirming the widening quality gap between LLM and human responses over time. Our work contributes a multi-turn benchmark exposing LLM degradation in knowledge-grounded role-play dialogues and provides a validated hybrid evaluation framework to guide the reliable integration of LLMs in training simulations.

      Sequential multi-agent systems built with large language models (LLMs) can automate complex software tasks, but they are hard to trust because errors quietly pass from one stage to the next. We study a traceable and accountable pipeline, meaning a system with clear roles, structured handoffs, and saved records that let us trace who did what at each step and assign blame when things go wrong. Our setting is a Planner -> Executor -> Critic pipeline. We evaluate eight configurations of three state-of-the-art LLMs on three benchmarks and analyze where errors start, how they spread, and how they can be fixed. Our results show: (1) adding a structured, accountable handoff between agents markedly improves accuracy and prevents the failures common in simple pipelines; (2) models have clear role-specific strengths and risks (e.g., steady planning vs. high-variance critiquing), which we quantify with repair and harm rates; and (3) accuracy-cost-latency trade-offs are task-dependent, with heterogeneous pipelines often the most efficient. Overall, we provide a practical, data-driven method for designing, tracing, and debugging reliable, predictable, and accountable multi-agent systems.

Moreover, because LLMs often generate code with subtle bugs that can be missed under traditional unit or fuzz testing, RustAssure performs differential symbolic testing to establish the semantic similarity between the original C and LLM-transpiled Rust code. We evaluated RustAssure with five real-world applications and libraries, and showed that our system is able to generate compilable Rust functions for 89.8% of all C functions, of which 69.9% produced equivalent symbolic return values for both the C and Rust functions.

Formulating the attack path as a problem of $\textit{maximum-flow minimum-cost}$, coupled with the novel $\textit{Permutation-Invariant Evasion Loss (PIEL)}$, we leverage graph-based optimization to maximize attack success rate while minimizing detection risk. Evaluating across models including $\texttt{Llama}$, $\texttt{Mistral}$, $\texttt{Gemma}$, $\texttt{DeepSeek}$ and other variants on various datasets like $\texttt{JailBreakBench}$ and $\texttt{AdversarialBench}$, our method outperforms conventional attacks by up to $7\times$, exposing critical vulnerabilities in multi-agent systems.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful reasoners in natural language, but their actions are typically confined to outputting vocabulary tokens. As a result, interactions with external environments -- such as symbolic operators or simulators -- must be expressed through text in predefined formats, parsed, and routed to external interfaces. This overloads the model's language with both reasoning and control duties, and requires a hand-crafted parser, external to the LLM. To address this, we decouple environment interactions from language by internalizing them in an Expanded Action space (ExpA), beyond the vocabulary. The model starts reasoning in the default language environment, but may trigger routing actions and switch to an external environment at any time. From there, the model can only invoke environment-specific actions, receive feedback from the environment, and potentially route back to language as a result. To promote effective exploration of the expanded action space and new environments, we introduce ExpA Reinforcement Learning (EARL) with counterfactual policy optimization. On tasks requiring multi-turn interactions and contingent planning, EARL outperforms strong baselines with vocabulary-constrained actions. It performs robustly across calculator-based multi-task learning and, in the partially observed sorting problem, achieves perfect Sort-4 accuracy while self-discovering an efficient algorithm competitive with classical designs.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      LLMs are trained to refuse harmful instructions, but do they truly understand harmfulness beyond just refusing? Prior work has shown that LLMs' refusal behaviors can be mediated by a one-dimensional subspace, i.e., a refusal direction. In this work, we identify a new dimension to analyze safety mechanisms in LLMs, i.e., harmfulness, which is encoded internally as a separate concept from refusal. There exists a harmfulness direction that is distinct from the refusal direction. As causal evidence, steering along the harmfulness direction can lead LLMs to interpret harmless instructions as harmful, but steering along the refusal direction tends to elicit refusal responses directly without reversing the model's judgment on harmfulness. Furthermore, using our identified harmfulness concept, we find that certain jailbreak methods work by reducing the refusal signals without reversing the model's internal belief of harmfulness. We also find that adversarially finetuning models to accept harmful instructions has minimal impact on the model's internal belief of harmfulness. These insights lead to a practical safety application: The model's latent harmfulness representation can serve as an intrinsic safeguard (Latent Guard) for detecting unsafe inputs and reducing over-refusals that is robust to finetuning attacks. For instance, our Latent Guard achieves performance comparable to or better than Llama Guard 3 8B, a dedicated finetuned safeguard model, across different jailbreak methods. Our findings suggest that LLMs' internal understanding of harmfulness is more robust than their refusal decision to diverse input instructions, offering a new perspective to study AI safety.

      LLM-as-a-Judge (LLMaaJ) enables scalable evaluation, yet we lack a decisive test of a judge's qualification: can it recover the hidden objective of a conversation and know when that inference is reliable? Large language models degrade with irrelevant or lengthy context, and multi-turn jailbreaks can scatter goals across turns. We present ObjexMT, a benchmark for objective extraction and metacognition. Given a multi-turn transcript, a model must output a one-sentence base objective and a self-reported confidence. Accuracy is scored by semantic similarity to gold objectives, then thresholded once on 300 calibration items ($\tau^\star = 0.66$; $F_1@\tau^\star = 0.891$). Metacognition is assessed with expected calibration error, Brier score, Wrong@High-Confidence (0.80 / 0.90 / 0.95), and risk--coverage curves. Across six models (gpt-4.1, claude-sonnet-4, Qwen3-235B-A22B-FP8, kimi-k2, deepseek-v3.1, gemini-2.5-flash) evaluated on SafeMTData\_Attack600, SafeMTData\_1K, and MHJ, kimi-k2 achieves the highest objective-extraction accuracy (0.612; 95\% CI [0.594, 0.630]), while claude-sonnet-4 (0.603) and deepseek-v3.1 (0.599) are statistically tied. claude-sonnet-4 offers the best selective risk and calibration (AURC 0.242; ECE 0.206; Brier 0.254). Performance varies sharply across datasets (16--82\% accuracy), showing that automated obfuscation imposes challenges beyond model choice. High-confidence errors remain: Wrong@0.90 ranges from 14.9\% (claude-sonnet-4) to 47.7\% (Qwen3-235B-A22B-FP8). ObjexMT therefore supplies an actionable test for LLM judges: when objectives are implicit, judges often misinfer them; exposing objectives or gating decisions by confidence is advisable.

      Recent research shows that LLM Agents can generate ``believable'' human behaviors via prompt-only methods, and such agents have been increasingly adopted in downstream applications. However, existing evaluation of these agents only focuses on qualitative believability (whether human raters think they are accurate), leaving open questions of whether LLM agents can accurately generate step-by-step actions mimicking a particular human's behavior in a multi-turn interaction task. In this work, we take shopping as a case study and present the first large-scale quantitative evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs' ability to accurately simulate human behavior. Using real-world data from 31,865 online shopping sessions containing 230,965 user actions, our evaluation reveals that prompt-based LLMs (DeepSeek-R1, Llama, Claude) achieve only 11.86% accuracy in generating human actions, highlighting a substantial gap in actual behavioral accuracy. Through experiments, we also showcase that strategies as simple as fine-tuning LLMs on real human click-through data augmented with synthesized reasoning traces can greatly enhance models' performance. The fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B achieves 17.26% action generation accuracy and 33.86% F1 score on final purchase prediction, representing substantial improvements of 5.4% and 13.85% over prompt-only baselines. This work establishes the first rigorous benchmark for human behavior simulation and provides actionable insights for developing more accurate LLM agents for future downstream applications.

      Obtaining high-quality outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs) often depends upon the choice of a sampling-based decoding strategy to probabilistically choose the next token at each generation step. While a variety of such sampling methods have been proposed, their performance can be sensitive to the selection of hyperparameters which may require different settings depending upon the generation task and temperature configuration. In this work, we introduce $p$-less sampling: an information-theoretic approach to sampling which dynamically sets a truncation threshold at each decoding step based on the entire token probability distribution. Unlike existing methods, $p$-less sampling has no hyperparameters and consistently produces high-quality outputs as temperature increases. We provide theoretical perspectives on $p$-less sampling to ground our proposed method and conduct experiments to empirically validate its effectiveness across a range of math, logical reasoning, and creative writing tasks. Our results demonstrate how $p$-less sampling consistently outperforms existing sampling approaches while exhibiting much less degradation in text quality at higher temperature values. We further show how $p$-less achieves greater inference-time efficiency than alternative methods through lower average token sampling times and shorter generation lengths, without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we provide analyses to highlight the benefits of $p$-less through qualitative examples, case studies, and diversity assessments.

      Attention is foundational to large language models (LLMs), enabling different heads to have diverse focus on relevant input tokens. However, learned behaviors like attention sinks, where the first token receives the most attention despite limited semantic importance, suggest some heads may be inactive, and point to a significant source of computational redundancy. To analyze this phenomenon, we propose a taxonomy of 13 score functions that measure different ways a head can be inactive. Thresholding these scores allows us to analyze different sets of potentially inactive attention heads. We evaluate whether identified heads are inactive through model interventions, finding that more than 12% of attention heads are inactive on average, and can be ablated in specific contexts while maintaining MMLU accuracy to within 1% of the pretrained LLM. Across 3 model families, our score functions that measure the average norm of a head's output consistently identify inactive heads that would not have been found by score functions that rely solely on attention weights. We establish that relying on a score function that measures a first token attention sink would underestimate the prevalence of inactive heads, failing to identify more than 7% of inactive heads on average. We also show how measuring score distributions can provide insights into attention behavior. For instance, we find evidence that finetuning causes little to no change in attention behavior, and that even within the same model family, large model scales present markedly different attention behaviors.

      Recent advances in speech large language models (speech LLMs) have enabled seamless spoken interactions, but these systems still struggle with complex reasoning tasks. Previously, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting or fine-tuning has been to shown to significantly improve the reasoning abilities of text-based LLMs. In this work, we investigate the effect of CoT fine-tuning for multi-stream speech LLMs, demonstrating that reasoning in text space improves the accuracy of speech LLMs by 2.4x, on average, over a suite of spoken reasoning tasks. Beyond accuracy, the latency of the spoken response is a crucial factor for interacting with voice-based agents. Inspired by the human behavior of "thinking while listening," we propose methods to reduce the additional latency from reasoning by allowing the model to start reasoning before the user query has ended. To achieve this, we introduce an entropy-based metric, "question completeness," which acts as an indicator to guide the model on the optimal time to start reasoning. This method provides greater control over the accuracy-latency trade-off compared with heuristic-based approaches and, under equivalent latency conditions, yields a 4% accuracy gain on ARC-Easy. Finally, we use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on preference data created using rejection sampling to push the accuracy-latency pareto frontier further, resulting in a 70% reduction in latency without loss in accuracy.

      Enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs has garnered significant attention in both the mathematical and computer science communities. Recent works have made substantial progress in both Natural Language (NL) reasoning and Formal Language (FL) reasoning by leveraging the potential of pure Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods on base models. However, RL approaches struggle to impart new capabilities not presented in the base model, highlighting the need to integrate more knowledge like FL into NL math reasoning effectively. Yet, this integration is challenging due to inherent disparities in problem structure and reasoning format between NL and FL. To address these challenges, we introduce **NL-FL HybridReasoning (NFL-HR)**, an end-to-end framework designed to incorporate the FL expert into NL math problem-solving. To bridge the NL and FL input format gap, we propose the NL-FL Problem Alignment method, which reformulates the Question-Answering (QA) problems in NL as existence theorems in FL. Subsequently, the Mixed Problem Input technique we provide enables the FL reasoner to handle both QA and existence problems concurrently. Lastly, we mitigate the NL and FL output format gap in reasoning through an LLM-based Answer Extraction mechanism. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the NFL-HR framework achieves **89.80**% and **84.34%** accuracy rates on the MATH-500 and the AMC benchmarks, surpassing the NL baseline by **4.60%** and **4.82%**, respectively. Notably, some problems resolved by our framework remain unsolved by the NL baseline model even under a larger number of trials.

Further, different LLMs vary in performance in terms of their accuracy and effectiveness. Nevertheless, our empirical analysis shows that LLMs can play a valuable role as assistants for business process designers and users. We also study the LLM's "thought process" and ability to perform deeper reasoning in the context of process analysis and optimization. We find that the LLMs seem to exhibit anthropomorphic properties.

      Various layer-skipping methods have been proposed to accelerate token generation in large language models (LLMs). However, limited attention has been paid to a fundamental question: How do computational demands vary across the generation of different tokens? In this work, we introduce FlexiDepth, a method that dynamically adjusts the number of Transformer layers used in text generation. By incorporating a plug-in router and adapter, FlexiDepth enables adaptive computation in LLMs without modifying their original parameters. Applied to Llama-3-8B, it skips 8 out of 32 layers while maintaining full benchmark performance. Our experiments reveal that computational demands in LLMs significantly vary based on token type. Specifically, generating repetitive tokens or fixed phrases requires fewer layers, whereas producing tokens involving computation or high uncertainty requires more layers. Despite the computational savings, FlexiDepth does not yet achieve wall-clock speedup due to varied skipping patterns and I/O overhead. To inspire future work and advance research on practical speedup, we open-sourced FlexiDepth and a dataset documenting its layer allocation patterns.

Traditional strategies based on textual analysis have been critical for building the field's foundations and providing a valid, objective indicator of populist framing. Yet these approaches are costly, time consuming, and difficult to scale across languages, contexts, and large corpora. Here we present the results from a rubric and anchor guided chain of thought (CoT) prompting approach that mirrors human coder training. By leveraging the Global Populism Database (GPD), a comprehensive dataset of global leaders' speeches annotated for degrees of populism, we replicate the process used to train human coders by prompting the LLM with an adapted version of the same documentation to guide the model's reasoning. We then test multiple proprietary and open weight models by replicating scores in the GPD. Our findings reveal that this domain specific prompting strategy enables the LLM to achieve classification accuracy on par with expert human coders, demonstrating its ability to navigate the nuanced, context sensitive aspects of populism.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate user-tailored summaries, adapting outputs to specific stakeholders. In legal contexts, this raises important questions about motivated reasoning -- how models strategically frame information to align with a stakeholder's position within the legal system. Building on theories of legal realism and recent trends in legal practice, we investigate how LLMs respond to prompts conditioned on different legal roles (e.g., judges, prosecutors, attorneys) when summarizing judicial decisions. We introduce an evaluation framework grounded in legal fact and reasoning inclusion, also considering favorability towards stakeholders. Our results show that even when prompts include balancing instructions, models exhibit selective inclusion patterns that reflect role-consistent perspectives. These findings raise broader concerns about how similar alignment may emerge as LLMs begin to infer user roles from prior interactions or context, even without explicit role instructions. Our results underscore the need for role-aware evaluation of LLM summarization behavior in high-stakes legal settings.

      Efficient use of large language models (LLMs) is critical for deployment at scale: without adaptive routing, systems either overpay for strong models or risk poor performance from weaker ones. Selecting the right LLM for each query is fundamentally an online decision problem: models differ in strengths, prices fluctuate, and users value accuracy and cost differently. Yet most routers are trained offline with labels for all candidate models, an assumption that breaks in deployment, where only the outcome of the chosen model is observed. We bridge this gap with BaRP, a Bandit-feedback Routing with Preferences approach that trains under the same partial-feedback restriction as deployment, while supporting preference-tunable inference: operators can dial the performance/cost trade-off at test time without retraining. Framed as a contextual bandit over prompt features and a user preference vector, our method simulates an online feedback setting during training and adapts its routing decisions to each new prompt, rather than depending on full-information offline supervision. Comprehensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms strong offline routers by at least 12.46% and the largest LLM by at least 2.45%, and generalizes robustly for unseen tasks.

      The immense model sizes of large language models (LLMs) challenge deployment on memory-limited consumer GPUs. Although model compression and parameter offloading are common strategies to address memory limitations, compression can degrade quality, and offloading maintains quality but suffers from slow inference. Speculative decoding presents a promising avenue to accelerate parameter offloading, utilizing a fast draft model to propose multiple draft tokens, which are then verified by the target LLM in parallel with a single forward pass. This method reduces the time-consuming data transfers in forward passes that involve offloaded weight transfers. Existing methods often rely on pretrained weights of the same family, but require additional training to align with custom-trained models. Moreover, approaches that involve draft model training usually yield only modest speedups. This limitation arises from insufficient alignment with the target model, preventing higher token acceptance lengths. To address these challenges and achieve greater speedups, we propose SubSpec, a plug-and-play method to accelerate parameter offloading that is lossless and training-free. SubSpec constructs a highly aligned draft model by generating low-bit quantized substitute layers from offloaded target LLM portions. Additionally, our method shares the remaining GPU-resident layers and the KV-Cache, further reducing memory overhead and enhance alignment. SubSpec achieves a high average acceptance length, delivering 9.1x speedup for Qwen2.5 7B on MT-Bench (8GB VRAM limit) and an average of 12.5x speedup for Qwen2.5 32B on popular generation benchmarks (24GB VRAM limit).

Bioinformatics is a domain where fully autonomous AI-driven discovery may be near, but no extensive benchmarks for measuring progress have been introduced to date.

      Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in many natural language tasks but still struggle with complex, multi-step reasoning, particularly across diverse disciplines. Existing reasoning datasets often lack disciplinary breadth, reasoning depth, and diversity, and lack guiding principles for question synthesis. We propose DESIGNER: a DESIGN-logic-guidEd Reasoning data synthesis pipeline that leverages naturally available, extensive raw documents (e.g., book corpus and web corpus) to generate multidisciplinary challenging questions. We introduce the concept of "design logic" and instruct LLMs to mimic human educators' question-creation process, enabling automated synthesis of large-scale, high-difficulty questions. We use LLMs to reverse-engineer and abstract over 120,000 design logics from existing questions across various disciplines. By matching these design logics with source documents, we are able to create reasoning questions that far surpass the difficulty and diversity of existing datasets. Using this pipeline, we synthesized two large-scale reasoning datasets that span 75 disciplines: DLR-Book (3.04 million questions from the book corpus) and DLR-Web (1.66 million questions from the web corpus). Data analysis indicates that the questions synthesized by our method exhibit greater difficulty and diversity compared to those in the baseline datasets. We validate our synthesized data through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the Qwen3 and Llama3 model families. Our data substantially enhances their multidisciplinary reasoning capabilities, outperforming existing datasets.

By fine-tuning multimodal LLMs with temporal annotations from well-annotated datasets, e.g., dense video captioning datasets, their temporal understanding capacity in video-language tasks can be obtained. However, there is a notable lack of untrimmed audio-visual video datasets with precise temporal annotations for events. This deficiency hinders LLMs from learning the alignment between time, audio-visual events, and text tokens, thus impairing their ability to temporally localize audio-visual events in videos. To address this gap, we introduce PU-VALOR, a comprehensive audio-visual dataset comprising over 114,000 pseudo-untrimmed videos with detailed temporal annotations. PU-VALOR is derived from the large-scale but coarse-annotated audio-visual dataset VALOR, through a subtle method involving event-based video clustering, random temporal scaling, and permutation. By fine-tuning a multimodal LLM on PU-VALOR, we developed AVicuna, a model capable of aligning audio-visual events with temporal intervals and corresponding text tokens. AVicuna excels in temporal localization and time-aware dialogue capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate that AVicuna effectively handles temporal understanding in audio-visual videos and achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-ended video QA, audio-visual QA, and audio-visual event dense localization tasks.

At inference, a multi-armed bandit policy dynamically selects among these attack-style experts based on the target model's response safety, balancing exploration and exploitation. Red-Bandit achieves state-of-the-art results on AdvBench under sufficient exploration (ASR@10), while producing more human-readable prompts (lower perplexity). Moreover, Red-Bandit's bandit policy serves as a diagnostic tool for uncovering model-specific vulnerabilities by indicating which attack styles most effectively elicit unsafe behaviors.

      Causal reasoning is fundamental for Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand genuine cause-and-effect relationships beyond pattern matching. Existing benchmarks suffer from critical limitations such as reliance on synthetic data and narrow domain coverage. We introduce a novel benchmark constructed from casually identified relationships extracted from top-tier economics and finance journals, drawing on rigorous methodologies including instrumental variables, difference-in-differences, and regression discontinuity designs. Our benchmark comprises 40,379 evaluation items covering five task types across domains such as health, environment, technology, law, and culture. Experimental results on eight state-of-the-art LLMs reveal substantial limitations, with the best model achieving only 57.6\% accuracy. Moreover, model scale does not consistently translate to superior performance, and even advanced reasoning models struggle with fundamental causal relationship identification. These findings underscore a critical gap between current LLM capabilities and demands of reliable causal reasoning in high-stakes applications.

      Simulating step-wise human behavior with Large Language Models (LLMs) has become an emerging research direction, enabling applications in various practical domains. While prior methods, including prompting, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning (RL), have shown promise in modeling step-wise behavior, they primarily learn a population-level policy without conditioning on a user's persona, yielding generic rather than personalized simulations. In this work, we pose a critical question: how can LLM agents better simulate personalized user behavior? We introduce Customer-R1, an RL-based method for personalized, step-wise user behavior simulation in online shopping environments. Our policy is conditioned on an explicit persona, and we optimize next-step rationale and action generation via action correctness reward signals. Experiments on the OPeRA dataset emonstrate that Customer-R1 not only significantly outperforms prompting and SFT-based baselines in next-action prediction tasks, but also better matches users' action distribution, indicating higher fidelity in personalized behavior simulation.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Poisoning attacks can compromise the safety of large language models (LLMs) by injecting malicious documents into their training data. Existing work has studied pretraining poisoning assuming adversaries control a percentage of the training corpus. However, for large models, even small percentages translate to impractically large amounts of data. This work demonstrates for the first time that poisoning attacks instead require a near-constant number of documents regardless of dataset size. We conduct the largest pretraining poisoning experiments to date, pretraining models from 600M to 13B parameters on chinchilla-optimal datasets (6B to 260B tokens). We find that 250 poisoned documents similarly compromise models across all model and dataset sizes, despite the largest models training on more than 20 times more clean data. We also run smaller-scale experiments to ablate factors that could influence attack success, including broader ratios of poisoned to clean data and non-random distributions of poisoned samples. Finally, we demonstrate the same dynamics for poisoning during fine-tuning. Altogether, our results suggest that injecting backdoors through data poisoning may be easier for large models than previously believed as the number of poisons required does not scale up with model size, highlighting the need for more research on defences to mitigate this risk in future models.

      Are large language models (LLMs) sensitive to the distinction between humanly possible languages and humanly impossible languages? This question is taken by many to bear on whether LLMs and humans share the same innate learning biases. Previous work has attempted to answer it in the positive by comparing LLM learning curves on existing language datasets and on "impossible" datasets derived from them via various perturbation functions. Using the same methodology, we examine this claim on a wider set of languages and impossible perturbations. We find that in most cases, GPT-2 learns each language and its impossible counterpart equally easily, in contrast to previous claims. We also apply a more lenient condition by testing whether GPT-2 provides any kind of separation between the whole set of natural languages and the whole set of impossible languages. By considering cross-linguistic variance in various metrics computed on the perplexity curves, we show that GPT-2 provides no systematic separation between the possible and the impossible. Taken together, these perspectives show that LLMs do not share the human innate biases that shape linguistic typology.

We demonstrate that these interactive behaviors leave distinctive fingerprints in encrypted traffic exchanged between users and LLM agents. By analyzing traffic patterns associated with agent workflows and tool invocations, adversaries can infer agent activities, distinguish specific agents, and even profile sensitive user attributes. To highlight this risk, we develop AgentPrint, which achieves an F1-score of 0.866 in agent identification and attains 73.9% and 69.1% top-3 accuracy in user attribute inference for simulated- and real-user settings, respectively. These results uncover an overlooked risk: the very interactivity that empowers LLM agents also exposes user privacy, underscoring the urgent need for technical countermeasures alongside regulatory and policy safeguards.

      Recent studies apply psychometric questionnaires to Large Language Models (LLMs) to assess high-level psychological constructs such as values, personality, moral foundations, and dark traits. Although prior work has raised concerns about possible data contamination from psychometric inventories, which may threaten the reliability of such evaluations, there has been no systematic attempt to quantify the extent of this contamination. To address this gap, we propose a framework to systematically measure data contamination in psychometric evaluations of LLMs, evaluating three aspects: (1) item memorization, (2) evaluation memorization, and (3) target score matching. Applying this framework to 21 models from major families and four widely used psychometric inventories, we provide evidence that popular inventories such as the Big Five Inventory (BFI-44) and Portrait Values Questionnaire (PVQ-40) exhibit strong contamination, where models not only memorize items but can also adjust their responses to achieve specific target scores.

      Large language models are emerging as powerful tools for scientific law discovery, a foundational challenge in AI-driven science. However, existing benchmarks for this task suffer from a fundamental methodological trilemma, forcing a trade-off between scientific relevance, scalability, and resistance to memorization. Furthermore, they oversimplify discovery as static function fitting, failing to capture the authentic scientific process of uncovering embedded laws through the interactive exploration of complex model systems. To address these critical gaps, we introduce NewtonBench, a benchmark comprising 324 scientific law discovery tasks across 12 physics domains. Our design mitigates the evaluation trilemma by using metaphysical shifts - systematic alterations of canonical laws - to generate a vast suite of problems that are scalable, scientifically relevant, and memorization-resistant. Moreover, we elevate the evaluation from static function fitting to interactive model discovery, requiring agents to experimentally probe simulated complex systems to uncover hidden principles. Our extensive experiment reveals a clear but fragile capability for discovery in frontier LLMs: this ability degrades precipitously with increasing system complexity and exhibits extreme sensitivity to observational noise. Notably, we uncover a paradoxical effect of tool assistance: providing a code interpreter can hinder more capable models by inducing a premature shift from exploration to exploitation, causing them to satisfice on suboptimal solutions. These results demonstrate that robust, generalizable discovery in complex, interactive environments remains the core challenge. By providing a scalable, robust, and scientifically authentic testbed, NewtonBench offers a crucial tool for measuring true progress and guiding the development of next-generation AI agents capable of genuine scientific discovery.

      Sarcasm is a subtle form of non-literal language that poses significant challenges for speech synthesis due to its reliance on nuanced semantic, contextual, and prosodic cues. While existing speech synthesis research has focused primarily on broad emotional categories, sarcasm remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-enhanced Retrieval-Augmented framework for sarcasm-aware speech synthesis. Our approach combines (1) semantic embeddings from a LoRA-fine-tuned LLaMA 3, which capture pragmatic incongruity and discourse-level cues of sarcasm, and (2) prosodic exemplars retrieved via a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) module, which provide expressive reference patterns of sarcastic delivery. Integrated within a VITS backbone, this dual conditioning enables more natural and contextually appropriate sarcastic speech. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines in both objective measures and subjective evaluations, yielding improvements in speech naturalness, sarcastic expressivity, and downstream sarcasm detection.

      Distributed inference of large language models (LLMs) can introduce overheads of up to 20% even over GPUs connected via high-speed interconnects such as NVLink. Multiple techniques have been proposed to mitigate these overheads by decomposing computations into finer-grained tasks and overlapping communication with sub-tasks as they complete. However, fine-grained decomposition of a large computation into many smaller computations on GPUs results in overheads. Furthermore, the communication itself uses many streaming multiprocessors (SMs), adding to the overhead. We present TokenWeave to address these challenges. TokenWeave proposes a Token-Splitting technique that divides the tokens in the inference batch into two approximately equal subsets in a wave-aware manner. The communication of one subset is then overlapped with the computation of the other. In addition, TokenWeave optimizes the order of the layer normalization computation with respect to communication operations and implements a novel fused AllReduce--RMSNorm kernel that carefully leverages Multimem instruction support available on Hopper and Blackwell NVIDIA GPUs. These optimizations allow TokenWeave to perform communication and RMSNorm using only 2-8 SMs. Moreover, our kernel enables the memory-bound RMSNorm to be overlapped with the other batch's computation, providing additional gains. Our evaluations demonstrate up to 1.29x speedup in latency and 1.26x higher throughput across multiple models and workloads. In several settings, TokenWeave results in better performance compared to an equivalent model with all communication removed.

      Existing methods for evaluating the factuality of large language model (LLM) responses treat all claims as equally important. This results in misleading evaluations when vital information is missing or incorrect as it receives the same weight as peripheral details, raising the question: how can we reliably detect such differences when there are errors in key information? Current approaches that measure factuality tend to be insensitive to omitted or false key information. To investigate this lack of sensitivity, we construct VITALERRORS, a benchmark of 6,733 queries with minimally altered LLM responses designed to omit or falsify key information. Using this dataset, we demonstrate the insensitivities of existing evaluation metrics to key information errors. To address this gap, we introduce VITAL, a set of metrics that provide greater sensitivity in measuring the factuality of responses by incorporating the relevance and importance of claims with respect to the query. Our analysis demonstrates that VITAL metrics more reliably detect errors in key information than previous methods. Our dataset, metrics, and analysis provide a foundation for more accurate and robust assessment of LLM factuality.

      Designing high-performing heuristics for vehicle routing problems (VRPs) is a complex task that requires both intuition and deep domain knowledge. Large language model (LLM)-based code generation has recently shown promise across many domains, but it still falls short of producing heuristics that rival those crafted by human experts. In this paper, we propose VRPAgent, a framework that integrates LLM-generated components into a metaheuristic and refines them through a novel genetic search. By using the LLM to generate problem-specific operators, embedded within a generic metaheuristic framework, VRPAgent keeps tasks manageable, guarantees correctness, and still enables the discovery of novel and powerful strategies. Across multiple problems, including the capacitated VRP, the VRP with time windows, and the prize-collecting VRP, our method discovers heuristic operators that outperform handcrafted methods and recent learning-based approaches while requiring only a single CPU core. To our knowledge, \VRPAgent is the first LLM-based paradigm to advance the state-of-the-art in VRPs, highlighting a promising future for automated heuristics discovery.

      Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance on complex mathematical benchmarks yet sometimes fail on basic math reasoning while generating unnecessarily verbose responses. In this paper, we present a systematic benchmark and comprehensive empirical study to evaluate the efficiency of reasoning in LLMs, focusing on the fundamental tradeoff between accuracy and overthinking. First, we formalize the accuracy-verbosity tradeoff. Second, we introduce the Overthinking Score, a harmonic-mean metric combining accuracy and token-efficiency for holistic model evaluation. Third, we establish an evaluation protocol with dynamically-generated data across 14 basic math tasks. Fourth, we conduct a large-scale empirical study evaluating 53 LLMs, including reasoning and quantized variants across different reasoning budgets. Our findings reveal: 1) model performance on complex benchmarks does not translate directly to basic math reasoning; 2) reasoning models generate ~18 more tokens while sometimes achieving lower accuracy and exhibit catastrophic collapse when token is constrained, dropping by ~28; 3) the accuracy-verbosity relationship is non-monotonic with extended reasoning budgets yielding diminishing returns (GPT-5/o-series models show zero accuracy gain from low -> medium -> high reasoning effort). Our findings challenge the assumption that longer reasoning in LLMs necessarily improves mathematical reasoning.

      Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for decision-making tasks under uncertainty; however, their risk profiles and how they are influenced by prompting and alignment methods remain underexplored. Existing studies have primarily examined personality prompting or multi-agent interactions, leaving open the question of how post-training influences the risk behavior of LLMs. In this work, we propose a new pipeline for eliciting, steering, and modulating LLMs' risk profiles, drawing on tools from behavioral economics and finance. Using utility-theoretic models, we compare pre-trained, instruction-tuned, and RLHF-aligned LLMs, and find that while instruction-tuned models exhibit behaviors consistent with some standard utility formulations, pre-trained and RLHF-aligned models deviate more from any utility models fitted. We further evaluate modulation strategies, including prompt engineering, in-context learning, and post-training, and show that post-training provides the most stable and effective modulation of risk preference. Our findings provide insights into the risk profiles of different classes and stages of LLMs and demonstrate how post-training modulates these profiles, laying the groundwork for future research on behavioral alignment and risk-aware LLM design.

      Text clustering serves as a fundamental technique for organizing and interpreting unstructured textual data, particularly in contexts where manual annotation is prohibitively costly. With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their demonstrated effectiveness across a broad spectrum of NLP tasks, an emerging body of research has begun to explore their potential in the domain of text clustering. However, existing LLM-based approaches still rely on fine-tuned embedding models and sophisticated similarity metrics, rendering them computationally intensive and necessitating domain-specific adaptation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that reframes text clustering as a classification task by harnessing the in-context learning capabilities of LLMs. Our framework eliminates the need for fine-tuning embedding models or intricate clustering algorithms. It comprises two key steps: first, the LLM is prompted to generate a set of candidate labels based on the dataset and then merges semantically similar labels; second, it assigns the most appropriate label to each text sample. By leveraging the advanced natural language understanding and generalization capabilities of LLMs, the proposed approach enables effective clustering with minimal human intervention. Experimental results on diverse datasets demonstrate that our framework achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art embedding-based clustering techniques, while significantly reducing computational complexity and resource requirements. These findings underscore the transformative potential of LLMs in simplifying and enhancing text clustering tasks.

In a 4-player Stag Hunt, a one-word "cheap talk" channel increases cooperation from 0% to 48.3%, demonstrating communication as a robust coordination mechanism. In contrast, we find that curriculum learning is highly sensitive to design choices: our pedagogical curriculum through progressively complex games reduced agent payoffs by 27.4% in an Iterated Public Goods Game with Punishment. Qualitative analysis reveals that curricula emphasizing defection-equilibrium games can induce "learned pessimism" in agents.

This paper introduces Syn-Diag, a novel cloud-edge synergistic framework that leverages Large Language Models to overcome these limitations in few-shot fault diagnosis. Syn-Diag is built on a three-tiered mechanism: 1) Visual-Semantic Synergy, which aligns signal features with the LLM's semantic space through cross-modal pre-training; 2) Content-Aware Reasoning, which dynamically constructs contextual prompts to enhance diagnostic accuracy with limited samples; and 3) Cloud-Edge Synergy, which uses knowledge distillation to create a lightweight, efficient edge model capable of online updates via a shared decision space. Extensive experiments on six datasets covering different CWRU and SEU working conditions show that Syn-Diag significantly outperforms existing methods, especially in 1-shot and cross-condition scenarios. The edge model achieves performance comparable to the cloud version while reducing model size by 83% and latency by 50%, offering a practical, robust, and deployable paradigm for modern intelligent diagnostics.

      Cognitive diagnostics in the Web-based Intelligent Education System (WIES) aims to assess students' mastery of knowledge concepts from heterogeneous, noisy interactions. Recent work has tried to utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) for cognitive diagnosis, yet LLMs struggle with structured data and are prone to noise-induced misjudgments. Specially, WIES's open environment continuously attracts new students and produces vast amounts of response logs, exacerbating the data imbalance and noise issues inherent in traditional educational systems. To address these challenges, we propose DLLM, a Diffusion-based LLM framework for noise-robust cognitive diagnosis. DLLM first constructs independent subgraphs based on response correctness, then applies relation augmentation alignment module to mitigate data imbalance. The two subgraph representations are then fused and aligned with LLM-derived, semantically augmented representations. Importantly, before each alignment step, DLLM employs a two-stage denoising diffusion module to eliminate intrinsic noise while assisting structural representation alignment. Specifically, unconditional denoising diffusion first removes erroneous information, followed by conditional denoising diffusion based on graph-guided to eliminate misleading information. Finally, the noise-robust representation that integrates semantic knowledge and structural information is fed into existing cognitive diagnosis models for prediction. Experimental results on three publicly available web-based educational platform datasets demonstrate that our DLLM achieves optimal predictive performance across varying noise levels, which demonstrates that DLLM achieves noise robustness while effectively leveraging semantic knowledge from LLM.

      Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in solving mathematical problems expressed in natural language. However, multilingual and culturally-grounded mathematical reasoning in low-resource languages lags behind English due to the scarcity of socio-cultural task datasets that reflect accurate native entities such as person names, organization names, and currencies. Existing multilingual benchmarks are predominantly produced via translation and typically retain English-centric entities, owing to the high cost associated with human annotater-based localization. Moreover, automated localization tools are limited, and hence, truly localized datasets remain scarce. To bridge this gap, we introduce a framework for LLM-driven cultural localization of math word problems that automatically constructs datasets with native names, organizations, and currencies from existing sources. We find that translated benchmarks can obscure true multilingual math ability under appropriate socio-cultural contexts. Through extensive experiments, we also show that our framework can help mitigate English-centric entity bias and improves robustness when native entities are introduced across various languages.

      Before adopting a new large language model (LLM) architecture, it is critical to understand vulnerabilities accurately. Existing evaluations can be difficult to trust, often drawing conclusions from LLMs that are not meaningfully comparable, relying on heuristic inputs or employing metrics that fail to capture the inherent uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a principled and practical end-to-end framework for evaluating LLM vulnerabilities to prompt injection attacks. First, we propose practical approaches to experimental design, tackling unfair LLM comparisons by considering two practitioner scenarios: when training an LLM and when deploying a pre-trained LLM. Second, we address the analysis of experiments and propose a Bayesian hierarchical model with embedding-space clustering. This model is designed to improve uncertainty quantification in the common scenario that LLM outputs are not deterministic, test prompts are designed imperfectly, and practitioners only have a limited amount of compute to evaluate vulnerabilities. We show the improved inferential capabilities of the model in several prompt injection attack settings. Finally, we demonstrate the pipeline to evaluate the security of Transformer versus Mamba architectures. Our findings show that consideration of output variability can suggest less definitive findings. However, for some attacks, we find notably increased Transformer and Mamba-variant vulnerabilities across LLMs with the same training data or mathematical ability.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      The widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) imposes increasing demands on safety, such as reducing harmful content and fake information, and avoiding certain forbidden tokens due to rules and laws. While there have been several recent works studying safe alignment of LLMs, these works either require the training of reward and cost models and incur high memory and computational costs, or need prior knowledge about the optimal solution. Motivated by this fact, we study the problem of constrained alignment in LLMs, i.e., maximizing the output reward while restricting the cost due to potentially unsafe content to stay below a threshold. For this problem, we propose a novel primal-dual DPO approach, which first trains a model using standard DPO on reward preference data to provide reward information, and then adopts a rearranged Lagrangian DPO objective utilizing the provided reward information to fine-tune LLMs on cost preference data. Our approach significantly reduces memory and computational costs, and does not require extra prior knowledge. Moreover, we establish rigorous theoretical guarantees on the suboptimality and constraint violation of the output policy. We also extend our approach to an online data setting by incorporating exploration bonuses, which enables our approach to explore uncovered prompt-response space, and then provide theoretical results that get rid of the dependence on preference data coverage. Experimental results on the widely-used preference dataset PKU-SafeRLHF demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), the demand for high-performance LLM inference services continues to grow. To meet this demand, a growing number of AI accelerators have been proposed, such as Google TPU, Huawei NPU, Graphcore IPU, and Cerebras WSE, etc. Most of these accelerators adopt multi-core architectures to achieve enhanced scalability, but lack the flexibility of SIMT architectures. Therefore, without careful configuration of the hardware architecture, as well as deliberate design of tensor parallelism and core placement strategies, computational resources may be underutilized, resulting in suboptimal inference performance. To address these challenges, we first present a multi-level simulation framework with both transaction-level and performance-model-based simulation for multi-core NPUs. Using this simulator, we conduct a systematic analysis and further propose the optimal solutions for tensor parallelism strategies, core placement policies, memory management methods, as well as the selection between PD-disaggregation and PD-fusion on multi-core NPUs. We conduct comprehensive experiments on representative LLMs and various NPU configurations. The evaluation results demonstrate that, our solution can achieve 1.32x-6.03x speedup compared to SOTA designs for multi-core NPUs across different hardware configurations. As for LLM serving, our work offers guidance on designing optimal hardware architectures and serving strategies for multi-core NPUs across various LLM workloads.

      Identifying LLM-generated code through watermarking poses a challenge in preserving functional correctness. Previous methods rely on the assumption that watermarking high-entropy tokens effectively maintains output quality. Our analysis reveals a fundamental limitation of this assumption: syntax-critical tokens such as keywords often exhibit the highest entropy, making existing approaches vulnerable to logic corruption. We present STONE, a syntax-aware watermarking method that embeds watermarks only in non-syntactic tokens and preserves code integrity. For its rigorous assessment, we also introduce STEM, a comprehensive framework that balances three critical dimensions: correctness, detectability, and imperceptibility. Across Python, C++, and Java, STONE preserves correctness, sustains strong detectability, and achieves balanced performance with minimal overhead.

      Penetration testing and vulnerability assessment are essential industry practices for safeguarding computer systems. As cyber threats grow in scale and complexity, the demand for pentesting has surged, surpassing the capacity of human professionals to meet it effectively. With advances in AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), there have been attempts to automate the pentesting process. However, existing tools such as PentestGPT are still semi-manual, requiring significant professional human interaction to conduct pentests. To this end, we propose a novel LLM agent-based framework, AutoPentester, which automates the pentesting process. Given a target IP, AutoPentester automatically conducts pentesting steps using common security tools in an iterative process. It can dynamically generate attack strategies based on the tool outputs from the previous iteration, mimicking the human pentester approach. We evaluate AutoPentester using Hack The Box and custom-made VMs, comparing the results with the state-of-the-art PentestGPT. Results show that AutoPentester achieves a 27.0% better subtask completion rate and 39.5% more vulnerability coverage with fewer steps. Most importantly, it requires significantly fewer human interactions and interventions compared to PentestGPT. Furthermore, we recruit a group of security industry professional volunteers for a user survey and perform a qualitative analysis to evaluate AutoPentester against industry practices and compare it with PentestGPT. On average, AutoPentester received a score of 3.93 out of 5 based on user reviews, which was 19.8% higher than PentestGPT.

      Recent agent-based recommendation frameworks aim to simulate user behaviors by incorporating memory mechanisms and prompting strategies, but they struggle with hallucinating non-existent items and full-catalog ranking. Besides, a largely underexplored opportunity lies in leveraging LLMs'commonsense reasoning to capture user intent through substitute and complement relationships between items, which are usually implicit in datasets and difficult for traditional ID-based recommenders to capture. In this work, we propose a novel LLM-agent framework, AgenDR, which bridges LLM reasoning with scalable recommendation tools. Our approach delegates full-ranking tasks to traditional models while utilizing LLMs to (i) integrate multiple recommendation outputs based on personalized tool suitability and (ii) reason over substitute and complement relationships grounded in user history. This design mitigates hallucination, scales to large catalogs, and enhances recommendation relevance through relational reasoning. Through extensive experiments on three public grocery datasets, we show that our framework achieves superior full-ranking performance, yielding on average a twofold improvement over its underlying tools. We also introduce a new LLM-based evaluation metric that jointly measures semantic alignment and ranking correctness.

      Privacy-sensitive users require deploying large language models (LLMs) within their own infrastructure (on-premises) to safeguard private data and enable customization. However, vulnerabilities in local environments can lead to unauthorized access and potential model theft. To address this, prior research on small models has explored securing only the output layer within hardware-secured devices to balance model confidentiality and customization. Yet this approach fails to protect LLMs effectively. In this paper, we discover that (1) query-based distillation attacks targeting the secured top layer can produce a functionally equivalent replica of the victim model; (2) securing the same number of layers, bottom layers before a transition layer provide stronger protection against distillation attacks than top layers, with comparable effects on customization performance; and (3) the number of secured layers creates a trade-off between protection and customization flexibility. Based on these insights, we propose SOLID, a novel deployment framework that secures a few bottom layers in a secure environment and introduces an efficient metric to optimize the trade-off by determining the ideal number of hidden layers. Extensive experiments on five models (1.3B to 70B parameters) demonstrate that SOLID outperforms baselines, achieving a better balance between protection and downstream customization.

      Federated instruction tuning of large language models (LLMs) is challenged by significant data heterogeneity across clients, demanding robust personalization. The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, where experts can specialize in distinct data patterns, presents a natural architectural solution to this challenge. The inherent sparsity of the MoE architecture, achieved by selectively activating experts, poses a significant challenge to its integration with federated learning (FL). Conventional FL frameworks, designed for dense models, naively aggregate all expert parameters irrespective of their local activation patterns. This naive approach not only undermines MoE's dynamic sparsity but also risks corrupting the world knowledge within pretrained experts. To address this, we propose FLEx (Federated LLMs with Personalized Experts), a novel framework that leverages pretrained MoE-based LLMs for efficient personalization. By aggregating only the shared non-expert parameters, FLEx significantly reduces communication overhead and preserves the world knowledge stored within the frozen pretrained experts. For personalization, we introduce a novel expert grafting mechanism that leverages dynamic sparsity to construct a client-specific expert from selected components of pretrained experts, tailored to local data. This grafted expert is then fine-tuned locally alongside the gating mechanism. This joint training enables the model to learn when to leverage the shared knowledge from frozen experts and when to employ the personalized one. Evaluations on diverse, non-IID instruction tuning datasets show that FLEx consistently outperforms federated baselines on average, while demonstrating strong knowledge preservation on the knowledge-driven benchmark MMLU.

      Machine learning models are known to leak sensitive information, as they inevitably memorize (parts of) their training data. More alarmingly, large language models (LLMs) are now trained on nearly all available data, which amplifies the magnitude of information leakage and raises serious privacy risks. Hence, it is more crucial than ever to quantify privacy risk before the release of LLMs. The standard method to quantify privacy is via membership inference attacks, where the state-of-the-art approach is the Robust Membership Inference Attack (RMIA). In this paper, we present InfoRMIA, a principled information-theoretic formulation of membership inference. Our method consistently outperforms RMIA across benchmarks while also offering improved computational efficiency. In the second part of the paper, we identify the limitations of treating sequence-level membership inference as the gold standard for measuring leakage. We propose a new perspective for studying membership and memorization in LLMs: token-level signals and analyses. We show that a simple token-based InfoRMIA can pinpoint which tokens are memorized within generated outputs, thereby localizing leakage from the sequence level down to individual tokens, while achieving stronger sequence-level inference power on LLMs. This new scope rethinks privacy in LLMs and can lead to more targeted mitigation, such as exact unlearning.

      Recent advancements in language agents have led to significant improvements in multi-hop reasoning tasks. However, existing approaches often struggle with handling open-domain problems, which require massive information retrieval due to their reliance on a fixed sequence of actions. To address this, we propose Feedback-Guided Dynamic Interactive Planning (FGDIP), a novel framework tailored to enhance reasoning in LLMs by utilizing dynamic and adaptive strategies for information exploration in open-domain multi-hop reasoning tasks. Our approach begins by identifying key entities relevant to the problem, which serve as the initial nodes in the reasoning process. From these initial nodes, we then generate reasoning child nodes with the process being refined through a combination of historical error analysis and real-time feedback, which allows the framework to dynamically adjust and optimize its reasoning strategies. By integrating depth-first search with an innovative node generation technique, our framework adapts based on both prior error paths and concurrently generated nodes at the same hierarchical level. This dynamic strategy effectively expands the search space while ensuring the reasoning process systematically converges toward accurate solutions. Experimental results show that FGDIP achieved up to 54.47% F1 score on the HotpotQA dataset and 70.05% on the StrategyQA dataset, surpassing the best baseline by 5.03% and 7.25% respectively, highlighting its versatility and potential to enhance language agents in multi-hop reasoning tasks.

      This paper investigates algorithmic bias in language-based models for automated depression detection, focusing on socio-demographic disparities related to gender and race/ethnicity. Models trained using deep neural networks (DNN) based embeddings are compared to few-shot learning approaches with large language models (LLMs), evaluating both performance and fairness on clinical interview transcripts from the Distress Analysis Interview Corpus/Wizard-of-Oz (DAIC-WOZ). To mitigate bias, fairness-aware loss functions are applied to DNN-based models, while in-context learning with varied prompt framing and shot counts is explored for LLMs. Results indicate that LLMs outperform DNN-based models in depression classification, particularly for underrepresented groups such as Hispanic participants. LLMs also exhibit reduced gender bias compared to DNN-based embeddings, though racial disparities persist. Among fairness-aware techniques for mitigating bias in DNN-based embeddings, the worst-group loss, which is designed to minimize loss for the worst-performing demographic group, achieves a better balance between performance and fairness. In contrast, the fairness-regularized loss minimizes loss across all groups but performs less effectively. In LLMs, guided prompting with ethical framing helps mitigate gender bias in the 1-shot setting. However, increasing the number of shots does not lead to further reductions in disparities. For race/ethnicity, neither prompting strategy nor increasing $N$ in $N$-shot learning effectively reduces disparities.

We then formulate low-rank model compression as a bi-objective optimization and prove that a single uniform tolerance yields surrogate Pareto-optimal heterogeneous ranks. Based on our theoretical insights, we propose Pareto-Guided Singular Value Decomposition (PGSVD), a zero-shot pipeline that improves activation-aware compression via Pareto-guided rank selection and alternating least-squares implementation. We apply PGSVD to both LLM and VLM, showing better accuracy at the same compression levels and inference speedup.

Existing studies have primarily examined personality prompting or multi-agent interactions, leaving open the question of how post-training influences the risk behavior of LLMs. In this work, we propose a new pipeline for eliciting, steering, and modulating LLMs' risk profiles, drawing on tools from behavioral economics and finance. Using utility-theoretic models, we compare pre-trained, instruction-tuned, and RLHF-aligned LLMs, and find that while instruction-tuned models exhibit behaviors consistent with some standard utility formulations, pre-trained and RLHF-aligned models deviate more from any utility models fitted. We further evaluate modulation strategies, including prompt engineering, in-context learning, and post-training, and show that post-training provides the most stable and effective modulation of risk preference. Our findings provide insights into the risk profiles of different classes and stages of LLMs and demonstrate how post-training modulates these profiles, laying the groundwork for future research on behavioral alignment and risk-aware LLM design.

      Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are confronted with overwhelming information volume when comprehending long-form documents. This challenge raises the imperative of a cohesive memory module, which can elevate vanilla LLMs into autonomous reading agents. Despite the emergence of some heuristic approaches, a systematic design principle remains absent. To fill this void, we draw inspiration from Jean Piaget's Constructivist Theory, illuminating three traits of the agentic memory -- structured schemata, flexible assimilation, and dynamic accommodation. This blueprint forges a clear path toward a more robust and efficient memory system for LLM-based reading comprehension. To this end, we develop CAM, a prototype implementation of Constructivist Agentic Memory that simultaneously embodies the structurality, flexibility, and dynamicity. At its core, CAM is endowed with an incremental overlapping clustering algorithm for structured memory development, supporting both coherent hierarchical summarization and online batch integration. During inference, CAM adaptively explores the memory structure to activate query-relevant information for contextual response, akin to the human associative process. Compared to existing approaches, our design demonstrates dual advantages in both performance and efficiency across diverse long-text reading comprehension tasks, including question answering, query-based summarization, and claim verification.

      Prompt underspecification is a common challenge when interacting with LLMs. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of this problem, showing that while LLMs can often infer unspecified requirements by default (41.1%), such behavior is fragile: Under-specified prompts are 2x as likely to regress across model or prompt changes, sometimes with accuracy drops exceeding 20%. This instability makes it difficult to reliably build LLM applications. Moreover, simply specifying all requirements does not consistently help, as models have limited instruction-following ability and requirements can conflict. Standard prompt optimizers likewise provide little benefit. To address these issues, we propose requirements-aware prompt optimization mechanisms that improve performance by 4.8% on average over baselines. We further advocate for a systematic process of proactive requirements discovery, evaluation, and monitoring to better manage prompt underspecification in practice.

      The exponential increase in software vulnerabilities has created an urgent need for automatic vulnerability repair (AVR) solutions. Recent research has formulated AVR as a sequence generation problem and has leveraged large language models (LLMs) to address this problem. Typically, these approaches prompt or fine-tune LLMs to generate repairs for vulnerabilities directly. Although these methods show state-of-the-art performance, they face the following challenges: (1) Lack of high-quality, vulnerability-related reasoning data. Current approaches primarily rely on foundation models that mainly encode general programming knowledge. Without vulnerability-related reasoning data, they tend to fail to capture the diverse vulnerability repair patterns. (2) Hard to verify the intermediate vulnerability repair process during LLM training. Existing reinforcement learning methods often leverage intermediate execution feedback from the environment (e.g., sandbox-based execution results) to guide reinforcement learning training. In contrast, the vulnerability repair process generally lacks such intermediate, verifiable feedback, which poses additional challenges for model training.

      Large language models (LLMs) still struggle across tasks outside of high-resource languages. In this work, we investigate cross-lingual transfer to lower-resource languages where task-specific post-training data is scarce. Building on prior work, we first validate that the subsets of model parameters that matter most for mathematical reasoning and multilingual capabilities are distinctly non-overlapping. To exploit this implicit separability between task and target language parameterization, we develop and analyze numerous modular frameworks to improve the composition of the two during fine-tuning. These methods generally employ freezing parameters or post hoc model merging to assign math and language improvement to different key parts of the LLM. In the absence of in-language math data, we demonstrate that the modular approaches successfully improve upon baselines across three languages, four models, and two fine-tuning paradigms (full and LoRA). Furthermore, we identify the most consistently successful modular method to be fine-tuning separate language and math experts and model merging via Layer-Swapping, somewhat surprisingly. We offer possible explanations for this result via recent works on the linearity of task vectors. We further explain this by empirically showing that reverting less useful fine-tuning updates after training often outperforms freezing them from the start.

We show that contrastive features are not a prerequisite for effective activation redirection, and LUNAR achieves state-of-the-art unlearning performance and superior controllability. Specifically, LUNAR achieves between 2.9x and 11.7x improvement in the combined unlearning efficacy and model utility score (Deviation Score) across various base models and generates coherent, contextually appropriate responses post-unlearning. Moreover, LUNAR effectively reduces parameter updates to a single down-projection matrix, a novel design that significantly enhances efficiency by 20x and robustness. Finally, we demonstrate that LUNAR is robust to white-box adversarial attacks and versatile in real-world scenarios, including handling sequential unlearning requests.

      Designing user-centered LLM systems requires understanding how people use them, but patterns of user behavior are often masked by the variability of queries. In this work, we introduce a new framework to describe request-making that segments user input into request content, roles assigned, query-specific context, and the remaining task-independent expressions. We apply the workflow to create and analyze a dataset of 211k real-world queries based on WildChat. Compared with similar human-human setups, we find significant differences in the language for request-making in the human-LLM scenario. Further, we introduce a novel and essential perspective of diachronic analyses with user expressions, which reveals fundamental and habitual user-LLM interaction patterns beyond individual task completion. We find that query patterns evolve from early ones emphasizing sole requests to combining more context later on, and individual users explore expression patterns but tend to converge with more experience. From there, we propose to understand communal trends of expressions underlying distinct tasks and discuss the preliminary findings. Finally, we discuss the key implications for user studies, computational pragmatics, and LLM alignment.

      Attention sinks and compression valleys have attracted significant attention as two puzzling phenomena in large language models, but have been studied in isolation. In this work, we present a surprising connection between attention sinks and compression valleys, tracing both to the formation of massive activations in the residual stream. We prove theoretically that massive activations necessarily produce representational compression and establish bounds on the resulting entropy reduction. Through experiments across several models (410M-120B parameters), we confirm that when the beginning-of-sequence token develops extreme activation norms in the middle layers, both compression valleys and attention sinks emerge simultaneously. Targeted ablation studies validate our theoretical predictions. This unified view motivates us to propose the Mix-Compress-Refine theory of information flow, as an attempt to explain how LLMs organize their computation in depth by controlling attention and representational compression via massive activations. Specifically, we posit that Transformer-based LLMs process tokens in three distinct phases: (1) broad mixing in the early layers, (2) compressed computation with limited mixing in the middle layers, and (3) selective refinement in the late layers. Our framework helps explain why embedding tasks perform best at intermediate layers, whereas generation tasks benefit from full-depth processing, clarifying differences in task-dependent representations.
