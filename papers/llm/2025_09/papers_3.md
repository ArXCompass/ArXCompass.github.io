      Large Language Models (LLMs) are susceptible to adversarial attacks such as jailbreaking, which can elicit harmful or unsafe behaviors. This vulnerability is exacerbated in multilingual settings, where multilingual safety-aligned data is often limited. Thus, developing a guardrail capable of detecting and filtering unsafe content across diverse languages is critical for deploying LLMs in real-world applications. In this work, we introduce a multilingual guardrail with reasoning for prompt classification. Our method consists of: (1) synthetic multilingual data generation incorporating culturally and linguistically nuanced variants, (2) supervised fine-tuning, and (3) a curriculum-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework that further improves performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our multilingual guardrail, MrGuard, consistently outperforms recent baselines across both in-domain and out-of-domain languages by more than 15%. We also evaluate MrGuard's robustness to multilingual variations, such as code-switching and low-resource language distractors in the prompt, and demonstrate that it preserves safety judgments under these challenging conditions. The multilingual reasoning capability of our guardrail enables it to generate explanations, which are particularly useful for understanding language-specific risks and ambiguities in multilingual content moderation.

      Alignment of large language models (LLMs) with principles like helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness typically relies on scalar rewards that obscure which objectives drive the training signal. We introduce QA-LIGN, which decomposes monolithic rewards into interpretable principle-specific evaluations through structured natural language programs. Models learn through a draft, critique, and revise pipeline, where symbolic evaluation against the rubrics provides transparent feedback for both initial and revised responses during GRPO training. Applied to uncensored Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, QA-LIGN reduces attack success rates by up to 68.7% while maintaining a 0.67% false refusal rate, achieving Pareto optimal safety-helpfulness performance and outperforming both DPO and GRPO with state-of-the-art reward models given equivalent training. These results demonstrate that making reward signals interpretable and modular improves alignment effectiveness, suggesting transparency enhances LLM safety.

      Automatically reproducing Android app crashes from textual bug reports is challenging, particularly when the reports are incomplete and the modern UI exhibits high combinatorial complexity. Existing approaches based on reinforcement learning or large language models (LLMs) exhibit limitations in such scenarios. They struggle to infer unobserved steps and reconstruct the underlying user action sequences to navigate the vast UI interaction space, primarily due to limited goal-directed reasoning and planning. We present TreeMind, a novel technique that integrates LLMs with a customized Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to achieve strategic UI exploration in bug reproduction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to combine external decision-making with LLM semantic reasoning for reliable bug reproduction. We formulate the reproduction task as a target-driven search problem, leveraging MCTS as the core planning mechanism to iteratively refine action sequences. To enhance MCTS with semantic reasoning, we introduce two LLM-guided agents with distinct roles: Expander generates top-k promising actions based on the current UI state and exploration history, while Simulator estimates the likelihood that each action leads toward successful reproduction. By incorporating multi-modal UI inputs and advanced prompting techniques, TreeMind conducts feedback-aware navigation that identifies missing but essential user actions and incrementally reconstructs the reproduction paths. We evaluate TreeMind on a dataset of 93 real-world Android bug reports from three widely-used benchmarks. Experimental results show that it significantly outperforms four state-of-the-art baselines in reproduction success rate. A real-world case study indicates that integrating LLM reasoning with MCTS-based planning is a compelling direction for automated bug reproduction.

      In real-world scenarios, most of the data obtained from the information retrieval (IR) system is unstructured. Converting natural language sentences into structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs) remains a critical challenge. We identified three limitations with respect to existing KG construction methods: (1) There could be a large amount of noise in real-world documents, which could result in extracting messy information. (2) Naive LLMs usually extract inaccurate knowledge from some domain-specific documents. (3) Hallucination phenomenon cannot be overlooked when directly using LLMs to construct KGs. In this paper, we propose \textbf{GraphJudge}, a KG construction framework to address the aforementioned challenges. In this framework, we designed an entity-centric strategy to eliminate the noise information in the documents. And we fine-tuned a LLM as a graph judge to finally enhance the quality of generated KGs. Experiments conducted on two general and one domain-specific text-graph pair datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance against various baseline methods with strong generalization abilities.

      Recent work has explored training Large Language Model (LLM) search agents with reinforcement learning (RL) for open-domain question answering (QA). However, most evaluations focus solely on final answer accuracy, overlooking how these agents reason with and act on external evidence. We introduce SeekBench, the first benchmark for evaluating the \textit{epistemic competence} of LLM search agents through step-level analysis of their response traces. SeekBench comprises 190 expert-annotated traces with over 1,800 response steps generated by LLM search agents, each enriched with evidence annotations for granular analysis of whether agents (1) generate reasoning steps grounded in observed evidence, (2) adaptively reformulate searches to recover from low-quality results, and (3) have proper calibration to correctly assess whether the current evidence is sufficient for providing an answer.

      Large language models (LLMs) are known to generate politically biased text, yet how such biases arise remains unclear. A crucial step toward answering this question is the analysis of training data, whose political content remains largely underexplored in current LLM research. To address this gap, we present in this paper an analysis of the pre- and post-training corpora of OLMO2, the largest fully open-source model released together with its complete dataset. From these corpora, we draw large random samples, automatically annotate documents for political orientation, and analyze their source domains and content. We then assess how political content in the training data correlates with models' stance on specific policy issues. Our analysis shows that left-leaning documents predominate across datasets, with pre-training corpora containing significantly more politically engaged content than post-training data. We also find that left- and right-leaning documents frame similar topics through distinct values and sources of legitimacy. Finally, the predominant stance in the training data strongly correlates with models' political biases when evaluated on policy issues. These findings underscore the need to integrate political content analysis into future data curation pipelines as well as in-depth documentation of filtering strategies for transparency.

      Automating the translation of natural language to first-order logic (FOL) is crucial for knowledge representation and formal methods, yet remains challenging. We present a systematic evaluation of fine-tuned LLMs for this task, comparing architectures (encoder-decoder vs. decoder-only) and training strategies. Using the MALLS and Willow datasets, we explore techniques like vocabulary extension, predicate conditioning, and multilingual training, introducing metrics for exact match, logical equivalence, and predicate alignment. Our fine-tuned Flan-T5-XXL achieves 70% accuracy with predicate lists, outperforming GPT-4o and even the DeepSeek-R1-0528 model with CoT reasoning ability as well as symbolic systems like ccg2lambda. Key findings show: (1) predicate availability boosts performance by 15-20%, (2) T5 models surpass larger decoder-only LLMs, and (3) models generalize to unseen logical arguments (FOLIO dataset) without specific training. While structural logic translation proves robust, predicate extraction emerges as the main bottleneck.

      The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized AI development, yet the resource demands beyond a single cluster or even datacenter, limiting accessibility to well-resourced organizations. Decentralized training has emerged as a promising paradigm to leverage dispersed resources across clusters, datacenters and regions, offering the potential to democratize LLM development for broader communities. As the first comprehensive exploration of this emerging field, we present decentralized LLM training as a resource-driven paradigm and categorize existing efforts into community-driven and organizational approaches. We further clarify this through: (1) a comparison with related paradigms, (2) a characterization of decentralized resources, and (3) a taxonomy of recent advancements. We also provide up-to-date case studies and outline future directions to advance research in decentralized LLM training.

      This paper presents an evaluation framework for assessing Large Language Models' (LLMs) capabilities in combinatorial optimization, specifically addressing the 2D bin-packing problem. We introduce a systematic methodology that combines LLMs with evolutionary algorithms to generate and refine heuristic solutions iteratively. Through comprehensive experiments comparing LLM generated heuristics against traditional approaches (Finite First-Fit and Hybrid First-Fit), we demonstrate that LLMs can produce more efficient solutions while requiring fewer computational resources. Our evaluation reveals that GPT-4o achieves optimal solutions within two iterations, reducing average bin usage from 16 to 15 bins while improving space utilization from 0.76-0.78 to 0.83. This work contributes to understanding LLM evaluation in specialized domains and establishes benchmarks for assessing LLM performance in combinatorial optimization tasks.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit sycophantic behaviors -- such as excessive agreement with or flattery of the user -- but it is unclear whether these behaviors arise from a single mechanism or multiple distinct processes. We decompose sycophancy into sycophantic agreement and sycophantic praise, contrasting both with genuine agreement. Using difference-in-means directions, activation additions, and subspace geometry across multiple models and datasets, we show that: (1) the three behaviors are encoded along distinct linear directions in latent space; (2) each behavior can be independently amplified or suppressed without affecting the others; and (3) their representational structure is consistent across model families and scales. These results suggest that sycophantic behaviors correspond to distinct, independently steerable representations.

      Currently, the main approach for Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle the hallucination issue is incorporating Knowledge Graphs(KGs).However, LLMs typically treat KGs as plain text, extracting only semantic information and limiting their use of the crucial structural aspects of KGs. Another challenge is the gap between the embedding spaces of KGs encoders and LLMs text embeddings, which hinders the effective integration of structured knowledge. To overcome these obstacles, we put forward the SSKG-LLM, an innovative model architecture that is designed to efficiently integrate both the Structural and Semantic information of KGs into the reasoning processes of LLMs. SSKG-LLM incorporates the Knowledge Graph Retrieval (KGR) module and the Knowledge Graph Encoding (KGE) module to preserve semantics while utilizing structure. Then, the Knowledge Graph Adaptation (KGA) module is incorporated to enable LLMs to understand KGs embeddings. We conduct extensive experiments and provide a detailed analysis to explore how incorporating the structural information of KGs can enhance the factual reasoning abilities of LLMs. Our code are available at https://github.com/yfangZhang/SSKG-LLM.

      The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated remarkable capabilities, elevating the critical importance of LLM safety. However, existing safety methods rely on ad-hoc taxonomy and lack a rigorous, systematic protection, failing to ensure safety for the nuanced and complex behaviors of modern LLM systems. To address this problem, we solve LLM safety from legal compliance perspectives, named safety compliance. In this work, we posit relevant established legal frameworks as safety standards for defining and measuring safety compliance, including the EU AI Act and GDPR, which serve as core legal frameworks for AI safety and data security in Europe. To bridge the gap between LLM safety and legal compliance, we first develop a new benchmark for safety compliance by generating realistic LLM safety scenarios seeded with legal statutes. Subsequently, we align Qwen3-8B using Group Policy Optimization (GRPO) to construct a safety reasoner, Compliance Reasoner, which effectively aligns LLMs with legal standards to mitigate safety risks. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the Compliance Reasoner achieves superior performance on the new benchmark, with average improvements of +10.45% for the EU AI Act and +11.85% for GDPR.

In this paper, we investigate bias in LLM-generated peer reviews by conducting controlled experiments on sensitive metadata, including author affiliation and gender. Our analysis consistently shows affiliation bias favoring institutions highly ranked on common academic rankings. Additionally, we find some gender preferences, which, even though subtle in magnitude, have the potential to compound over time. Notably, we uncover implicit biases that become more evident with token-based soft ratings.

FLEXI systematically evaluates the latency, quality, and conversational effectiveness of real-time dialogue through six diverse human-LLM interaction scenarios, revealing significant gaps between open source and commercial models in emergency awareness, turn terminating, and interaction latency.

      Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the reliability of these reasoning chains remains a critical challenge. A widely held "cascading failure" hypothesis suggests that errors are most detrimental when they occur early in the reasoning process. This paper challenges that assumption through systematic error-injection experiments, revealing a counter-intuitive phenomenon we term "Late-Stage Fragility": errors introduced in the later stages of a CoT chain are significantly more likely to corrupt the final answer than identical errors made at the beginning. To address this specific vulnerability, we introduce the Adaptive Self-Correction Chain-of-Thought (ASCoT) method. ASCoT employs a modular pipeline in which an Adaptive Verification Manager (AVM) operates first, followed by the Multi-Perspective Self-Correction Engine (MSCE). The AVM leverages a Positional Impact Score function I(k) that assigns different weights based on the position within the reasoning chains, addressing the Late-Stage Fragility issue by identifying and prioritizing high-risk, late-stage steps. Once these critical steps are identified, the MSCE applies robust, dual-path correction specifically to the failure parts. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH demonstrate that ASCoT achieves outstanding accuracy, outperforming strong baselines, including standard CoT. Our work underscores the importance of diagnosing specific failure modes in LLM reasoning and advocates for a shift from uniform verification strategies to adaptive, vulnerability-aware correction mechanisms.

      Unsupervised analysis of text corpora is challenging, especially in data-scarce domains where traditional topic models struggle. While these models offer a solution, they typically describe clusters with lists of keywords that require significant manual effort to interpret and often lack semantic coherence. To address this critical interpretability gap, we introduce Recursive Thematic Partitioning (RTP), a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to interactively build a binary tree. Each node in the tree is a natural language question that semantically partitions the data, resulting in a fully interpretable taxonomy where the logic of each cluster is explicit. Our experiments demonstrate that RTP's question-driven hierarchy is more interpretable than the keyword-based topics from a strong baseline like BERTopic. Furthermore, we establish the quantitative utility of these clusters by showing they serve as powerful features in downstream classification tasks, particularly when the data's underlying themes correlate with the task labels. RTP introduces a new paradigm for data exploration, shifting the focus from statistical pattern discovery to knowledge-driven thematic analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the thematic paths from the RTP tree can serve as structured, controllable prompts for generative models. This transforms our analytical framework into a powerful tool for synthesis, enabling the consistent imitation of specific characteristics discovered in the source corpus.

      Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate code, yet they continue to hallucinate, often inventing non-existent libraries. Such library hallucinations are not just benign errors: they can mislead developers, break builds, and expose systems to supply chain threats such as slopsquatting. Despite increasing awareness of these risks, little is known about how real-world prompt variations affect hallucination rates. Therefore, we present the first systematic study of how user-level prompt variations impact library hallucinations in LLM-generated code. We evaluate six diverse LLMs across two hallucination types: library name hallucinations (invalid imports) and library member hallucinations (invalid calls from valid libraries). We investigate how realistic user language extracted from developer forums and how user errors of varying degrees (one- or multi-character misspellings and completely fake names/members) affect LLM hallucination rates. Our findings reveal systemic vulnerabilities: one-character misspellings in library names trigger hallucinations in up to 26% of tasks, fake library names are accepted in up to 99% of tasks, and time-related prompts lead to hallucinations in up to 84% of tasks. Prompt engineering shows promise for mitigating hallucinations, but remains inconsistent and LLM-dependent. Our results underscore the fragility of LLMs to natural prompt variation and highlight the urgent need for safeguards against library-related hallucinations and their potential exploitation.

      Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP), and recent studies have aimed to understand their underlying mechanisms. However, most of this research is conducted within a monolingual setting, primarily focusing on English. Few studies have attempted to explore the internal workings of LLMs in multilingual settings. In this study, we aim to fill this research gap by examining how neuron activation is shared across tasks and languages. We classify neurons into four distinct categories based on their responses to a specific input across different languages: all-shared, partial-shared, specific, and non-activated. Building upon this categorisation, we conduct extensive experiments on three tasks across nine languages using several LLMs and present an in-depth analysis in this work. Our findings reveal that: (i) deactivating the all-shared neurons significantly decreases performance; (ii) the shared neurons play a vital role in generating responses, especially for the all-shared neurons; (iii) neuron activation patterns are highly sensitive and vary across tasks, LLMs, and languages. These findings shed light on the internal workings of multilingual LLMs and pave the way for future research. We release the code to foster research in this area.

      Constituency parsing is a fundamental yet unsolved challenge in natural language processing. In this paper, we examine the potential of recent large language models (LLMs) to address this challenge. We reformat constituency parsing as a sequence-to-sequence generation problem and evaluate the performance of a diverse range of LLMs under zero-shot, few-shot, and supervised fine-tuning learning paradigms. We observe that while LLMs achieve acceptable improvements, they still encounter substantial limitations, due to the absence of mechanisms to guarantee the validity and faithfulness of the generated constituent trees. Motivated by this observation, we propose two strategies to guide LLMs to generate more accurate constituent trees by learning from erroneous samples and refining outputs in a multi-agent collaboration way, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that our methods effectively reduce the occurrence of invalid and unfaithful trees, thereby enhancing overall parsing performance and achieving promising results across different learning paradigms.

      Testing MMORPGs (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games) is a critical yet labor-intensive task in game development due to their complexity and frequent updating nature. Traditional automated game testing approaches struggle to achieve high state coverage and efficiency in these rich, open-ended environments, while existing LLM-based game-playing approaches are limited to shallow reasoning ability in understanding complex game state-action spaces and long-complex tasks. To address these challenges, we propose TITAN, an effective LLM-driven agent framework for intelligent MMORPG testing. TITAN incorporates four key components to: (1) perceive and abstract high-dimensional game states, (2) proactively optimize and prioritize available actions, (3) enable long-horizon reasoning with action trace memory and reflective self-correction, and (4) employ LLM-based oracles to detect potential functional and logic bugs with diagnostic reports. We implement the prototype of TITAN and evaluate it on two large-scale commercial MMORPGs spanning both PC and mobile platforms. In our experiments, TITAN achieves significantly higher task completion rates (95%) and bug detection performance compared to existing automated game testing approaches. An ablation study further demonstrates that each core component of TITAN contributes substantially to its overall performance. Notably, TITAN detects four previously unknown bugs that prior testing approaches fail to identify. We provide an in-depth discussion of these results, which offer guidance for new avenues of advancing intelligent, general-purpose testing systems. Moreover, TITAN has been deployed in eight real-world game QA pipelines, underscoring its practical impact as an LLM-driven game testing framework.

      The demand for efficient large language model (LLM) inference has intensified the focus on sparsification techniques. While semi-structured (N:M) pruning is well-established for weights, its application to activation pruning remains underexplored despite its potential for dynamic, input-adaptive compression and reductions in I/O overhead. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of methods for post-training N:M activation pruning in LLMs. Across multiple LLMs, we demonstrate that pruning activations enables superior preservation of generative capabilities compared to weight pruning at equivalent sparsity levels. We evaluate lightweight, plug-and-play error mitigation techniques and pruning criteria, establishing strong hardware-friendly baselines that require minimal calibration. Furthermore, we explore sparsity patterns beyond NVIDIA's standard 2:4, showing that the 16:32 pattern achieves performance nearly on par with unstructured sparsity. However, considering the trade-off between flexibility and hardware implementation complexity, we focus on the 8:16 pattern as a superior candidate. Our findings provide both effective practical methods for activation pruning and a motivation for future hardware to support more flexible sparsity patterns.

      Legal Article Prediction (LAP) is a critical task in legal text classification, leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques to automatically predict relevant legal articles based on the fact descriptions of cases. As a foundational step in legal decision-making, LAP plays a pivotal role in determining subsequent judgments, such as charges and penalties. Despite its importance, existing methods face significant challenges in addressing the complexities of LAP. Supervised classification models (SCMs), such as CNN and BERT, struggle to fully capture intricate fact patterns due to their inherent limitations. Conversely, large language models (LLMs), while excelling in generative tasks, perform suboptimally in predictive scenarios due to the abstract and ID-based nature of legal articles. Furthermore, the diversity of legal systems across jurisdictions exacerbates the issue, as most approaches are tailored to specific countries and lack broader applicability. To address these limitations, we propose Uni-LAP, a universal framework for legal article prediction that integrates the strengths of SCMs and LLMs through tight collaboration. Specifically, in Uni-LAP, the SCM is enhanced with a novel Top-K loss function to generate accurate candidate articles, while the LLM employs syllogism-inspired reasoning to refine the final predictions. We evaluated Uni-LAP on datasets from multiple jurisdictions, and empirical results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing baselines, showcasing its effectiveness and generalizability.

      Modern LLM serving systems confront inefficient GPU utilization due to the fundamental mismatch between compute-intensive prefill and memory-bound decode phases. While current practices attempt to address this by organizing these phases into hybrid batches, such solutions create an inefficient tradeoff that sacrifices either throughput or latency, leaving substantial GPU resources underutilized. We identify two key root causes: 1) the prefill phase suffers from suboptimal compute utilization due to wave quantization and attention bottlenecks. 2) hybrid batches disproportionately prioritize latency over throughput, resulting in wasted compute and memory bandwidth. To mitigate the issues, we present Bullet, a novel spatial-temporal orchestration system that eliminates these inefficiencies through precise phase coordination. Bullet enables concurrent execution of prefill and decode phases, while dynamically provisioning GPU resources using real-time performance modeling. By integrating SLO-aware scheduling and adaptive resource allocation, Bullet maximizes utilization without compromising latency targets. Experimental evaluations on real-world workloads demonstrate that Bullet delivers 1.26x average throughput gains (up to 1.55x) over state-of-the-arts, while consistently meeting latency constraints.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising approach for binary decompilation. However, the existing LLM-based decompilers still are somewhat limited in effectively presenting a program's source-level structure with its original identifiers. To mitigate this, we introduce SK2Decompile, a novel two-phase approach to decompile from the skeleton (semantic structure) to the skin (identifier) of programs. Specifically, we first apply a Structure Recovery model to translate a program's binary code to an Intermediate Representation (IR) as deriving the program's "skeleton", i.e., preserving control flow and data structures while obfuscating all identifiers with generic placeholders. We also apply reinforcement learning to reward the model for producing program structures that adhere to the syntactic and semantic rules expected by compilers. Second, we apply an Identifier Naming model to produce meaningful identifiers which reflect actual program semantics as deriving the program's "skin". We train the Identifier Naming model with a separate reinforcement learning objective that rewards the semantic similarity between its predictions and the reference code. Such a two-phase decompilation process facilitates advancing the correctness and readability of decompilation independently. Our evaluations indicate that SK2Decompile, significantly outperforms the SOTA baselines, achieving 21.6% average re-executability rate gain over GPT-5-mini on the HumanEval dataset and 29.4% average R2I improvement over Idioms on the GitHub2025 benchmark.

We fine-tune eight instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) on 3.9K factually grounded reasoning traces and rigorously evaluate them on six complex open-domain question-answering (QA) benchmarks encompassing 23.9K questions. Our results demonstrate that our fs1-tuned model (32B parameters) consistently outperforms instruction-tuned counterparts with parallel sampling by 6-14 absolute points (pass@$16$). Our detailed analysis shows that fs1 considerably improves model performance over more complex questions (requiring 3 or more hops on KG paths) and numerical answer types compared to the baselines. Furthermore, in single-pass inference, we notice that smaller LLMs show the most improvements. While prior works demonstrate the effectiveness of reasoning traces primarily in the STEM domains, our work shows strong evidence that anchoring reasoning to factual KG paths is a critical step in transforming LLMs for reliable knowledge-intensive tasks.

      Post-training compression of large language models (LLMs) largely relies on low-rank weight approximation, which represents each column of a weight matrix in a shared low-dimensional subspace. While this is a computationally efficient strategy, the imposed structural constraint is rigid and can lead to a noticeable model accuracy drop. In this work, we propose CoSpaDi (Compression via Sparse Dictionary Learning), a novel training-free compression framework that replaces low-rank decomposition with a more flexible structured sparse factorization in which each weight matrix is represented with a dense dictionary and a column-sparse coefficient matrix. This formulation enables a union-of-subspaces representation: different columns of the original weight matrix are approximated in distinct subspaces spanned by adaptively selected dictionary atoms, offering greater expressiveness than a single invariant basis. Crucially, CoSpaDi leverages a small calibration dataset to optimize the factorization such that the output activations of compressed projection layers closely match those of the original ones, thereby minimizing functional reconstruction error rather than mere weight approximation. This data-aware strategy preserves better model fidelity without any fine-tuning under reasonable compression ratios. Moreover, the resulting structured sparsity allows efficient sparse-dense matrix multiplication and is compatible with post-training quantization for further memory and latency gains. We evaluate CoSpaDi across multiple Llama and Qwen models under per-layer and per-group settings at 20-50\% compression ratios, demonstrating consistent superiority over state-of-the-art data-aware low-rank methods both in accuracy and perplexity. Our results establish structured sparse dictionary learning as a powerful alternative to conventional low-rank approaches for efficient LLM deployment.

      Activation steering is a promising technique for controlling LLM behavior by adding semantically meaningful vectors directly into a model's hidden states during inference. It is often framed as a precise, interpretable, and potentially safer alternative to fine-tuning. We demonstrate the opposite: steering systematically breaks model alignment safeguards, making it comply with harmful requests. Through extensive experiments on different model families, we show that even steering in a random direction can increase the probability of harmful compliance from 0% to 2-27%. Alarmingly, steering benign features from a sparse autoencoder (SAE), a common source of interpretable directions, increases these rates by a further 2-4%. Finally, we show that combining 20 randomly sampled vectors that jailbreak a single prompt creates a universal attack, significantly increasing harmful compliance on unseen requests. These results challenge the paradigm of safety through interpretability, showing that precise control over model internals does not guarantee precise control over model behavior.

      The growing demand for large language models (LLMs) with tunable reasoning capabilities in many real-world applications highlights a critical need for methods that can efficiently produce a spectrum of models balancing reasoning depth and computational cost. Model merging has emerged as a promising, training-free technique to address this challenge by arithmetically combining the weights of a general-purpose model with a specialized reasoning model. While various merging techniques exist, their potential to create a spectrum of models with fine-grained control over reasoning abilities remains largely unexplored. This work presents a large-scale empirical study evaluating a range of model merging techniques across multiple reasoning benchmarks. We systematically vary merging strengths to construct accuracy-efficiency curves, providing the first comprehensive view of the tunable performance landscape. Our findings reveal that model merging offers an effective and controllable method for calibrating the trade-off between reasoning accuracy and token efficiency, even when parent models have highly divergent weight spaces. Crucially, we identify instances of Pareto Improvement, where a merged model achieves both higher accuracy and lower token consumption than one of its parents. Our study provides the first comprehensive analysis of this tunable space, offering practical guidelines for creating LLMs with specific reasoning profiles to meet diverse application demands.

      Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) aims to remove specified data, but its efficacy is typically assessed with task-level metrics like accuracy and perplexity. We demonstrate that these metrics are often misleading, as models can appear to forget while their original behavior is easily restored through minimal fine-tuning. This phenomenon of \emph{reversibility} suggests that information is merely suppressed, not genuinely erased. To address this critical evaluation gap, we introduce a \emph{representation-level analysis framework}. Our toolkit comprises PCA-based similarity and shift, centered kernel alignment (CKA), and Fisher information, complemented by a summary metric, the mean PCA distance, to measure representational drift. Applying this framework across six unlearning methods, three data domains, and two LLMs, we identify four distinct forgetting regimes based on their \emph{reversibility} and \emph{catastrophicity}. Our analysis reveals that achieving the ideal state--irreversible, non-catastrophic forgetting--is exceptionally challenging. By probing the limits of unlearning, we identify a case of seemingly irreversible, targeted forgetting, offering new insights for designing more robust erasure algorithms. Our findings expose a fundamental gap in current evaluation practices and establish a representation-level foundation for trustworthy unlearning.

      Multi-turn dialogues are essential in many real-world applications of large language models, such as chatbots and virtual assistants. As conversation histories become longer, existing large language models face increasing computational and memory challenges, which hinder their ability to provide efficient and responsive interactions. Most current acceleration methods either compress the context or optimize key value caching, but they often rely on fixed or position-based heuristics that do not adapt well to the dynamic and unpredictable patterns found in actual multi-turn conversations. As a result, these models cannot accurately identify and prioritize the most relevant context, leading to degraded response quality. In this paper, we present LoopServe, an adaptive dual-phase inference acceleration framework for large language models in multi-turn dialogues. LoopServe introduces two main innovations. First, it performs online sparsification during the prefilling phase by dynamically selecting the most important parts of the attention matrix for each new input. Second, it uses progressive key value compression during decoding by adaptively maintaining a relevant and efficient cache based on the most recently generated output tokens. We also propose a new benchmark with eleven multi-turn datasets that reflect realistic query positions and conversational dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoopServe consistently achieves superior effectiveness compared to existing baselines and significantly accelerates LLM inference across a wide range of long-context dialogue tasks.

We introduce SchedCP, the first framework that enables fully autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents to safely and efficiently optimize Linux schedulers without human involvement. Our core insight is that the challenge is not merely to apply a better LLM, but to architect a decoupled control plane that separates the AI's role of semantic reasoning ("what to optimize") from the system's role of execution ("how to observe and act"). Implemented as Model Context Protocol(MCP) server, SchedCP provides a stable interface with three key services: a Workload Analysis Engine, an evolving Scheduler Policy Repository, and an Execution Verifier that validates all AI-generated code and configure before deployment with static and dynamic analysis. We demonstrate this architecture's power with sched-agent, a multi-agent system that autonomously analyzes workloads, synthesizes custom eBPF scheduling policies, and deploys them via the sched\_ext infrastructure. Our evaluation shows that SchedCP achieves up to an 1.79x performance improvement, and a 13x cost reduction compared to naive agentic approaches, all while maintaining high success rate. By bridging the semantic gap, SchedCP democratizes expert-level system optimization and represents a step towards creating truly self-optimizing, application-aware operating systems.

      Effective real-world multi-agent collaboration requires not only accurate planning but also the ability to reason about collaborators' intents -- a crucial capability for avoiding miscoordination and redundant communication under partial observable environments. Due to their strong planning and reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising autonomous agents for collaborative task solving. However, existing collaboration frameworks for LLMs overlook their reasoning potential for dynamic intent inference, and thus produce inconsistent plans and redundant communication, reducing collaboration efficiency. To bridge this gap, we propose CoBel-World, a novel framework that equips LLM agents with a collaborative belief world -- an internal representation jointly modeling the physical environment and collaborators' mental states. CoBel-World enables agents to parse open-world task knowledge into structured beliefs via a symbolic belief language, and perform zero-shot Bayesian-style belief updates through LLM reasoning. This allows agents to proactively detect potential miscoordination (e.g., conflicting plans) and communicate adaptively. Evaluated on challenging embodied benchmarks (i.e., TDW-MAT and C-WAH), CoBel-World significantly reduces communication costs by 22-60% and improves task completion efficiency by 4-28% compared to the strongest baseline. Our results show that explicit, intent-aware belief modeling is essential for efficient and human-like collaboration in LLM-based multi-agent systems.

      Recently, the development of large language models (LLMs) and reasoning large language models (RLLMs) have gained considerable attention from many researchers. RLLMs enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through Long Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) processes, significantly improving the performance of LLMs in addressing complex problems. However, there are few works that systematically explore what methods can fully unlock the performance of LLMs and RLLMs within the financial domain. To investigate the impact of various methods on LLMs and RLLMs, we utilize five LLMs and three RLLMs to assess the effects of prompting methods, agentic frameworks, and multilingual alignment methods on financial question-answering tasks. Our research findings indicate: (1) Current prompting methods and agent frameworks enhance the performance of LLMs in financial question answering by simulating Long CoT; (2) RLLMs possess inherent Long CoT capabilities, which limits the effectiveness of conventional methods in further enhancing their performance; (3) Current advanced multilingual alignment methods primarily improve the multilingual performance of LLMs by extending the reasoning length, which yields minimal benefits for RLLMs. Additionally, we discuss strategies for enhancing the performance of LLMs and RLLMs in financial question answering, which may serve as a inspiration for future improvements. We hope that this study can serve as an important reference for LLMs and RLLMs in the field of financial question answering.

      We address the challenge of generating diverse attack prompts for large language models (LLMs) that elicit harmful behaviors (e.g., insults, sexual content) and are used for safety fine-tuning. Rather than relying on manual prompt engineering, attacker LLMs can be trained with reinforcement learning (RL) to automatically generate such prompts using only a toxicity classifier as a reward. However, capturing a wide range of harmful behaviors is a significant challenge that requires explicit diversity objectives. Existing diversity-seeking RL methods often collapse to limited modes: once high-reward prompts are found, exploration of new regions is discouraged. Inspired by the active learning paradigm that encourages adaptive exploration, we introduce \textit{Active Attacks}, a novel RL-based red-teaming algorithm that adapts its attacks as the victim evolves. By periodically safety fine-tuning the victim LLM with collected attack prompts, rewards in exploited regions diminish, which forces the attacker to seek unexplored vulnerabilities. This process naturally induces an easy-to-hard exploration curriculum, where the attacker progresses beyond easy modes toward increasingly difficult ones. As a result, Active Attacks uncovers a wide range of local attack modes step by step, and their combination achieves wide coverage of the multi-mode distribution. Active Attacks, a simple plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates into existing RL objectives, unexpectedly outperformed prior RL-based methods -- including GFlowNets, PPO, and REINFORCE -- by improving cross-attack success rates against GFlowNets, the previous state-of-the-art, from 0.07% to 31.28% (a relative gain greater than $400\ \times$) with only a 6% increase in computation.

      Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a pivotal method for improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, prevalent RL approaches such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Group-Regularized Policy Optimization (GRPO) face critical limitations due to their reliance on sparse outcome-based rewards and inadequate mechanisms for incentivizing exploration. These limitations result in inefficient guidance for reasoning. Specifically, sparse rewards fail to deliver sufficient feedback, particularly for challenging problems. Furthermore, such rewards induce systematic biases that prioritize exploitation of familiar trajectories over novel solution discovery. These shortcomings critically hinder performance in complex reasoning tasks, which inherently demand iterative refinement across intermediate steps.

      The goal of this paper is to introduce SPADE, a framework for Structured Pruning and Adaptive Distillation for Efficient Large Language Model-based text-to-speech (LLM-TTS). Recent LLM-TTS systems achieve strong controllability and zero-shot generalization, but their large parameter counts and high latency limit real-world deployment. SPADE addresses this by combining (i) a pruning step guided by a word-error-rate-based layer importance index to remove non-essential Transformer layers, with (ii) multi-level knowledge distillation to restore autoregressive coherence. On zero-shot benchmarks, SPADE preserves near-parity perceptual quality while halving Transformer depth, reducing VRAM usage by up to 20%, and achieving up to 1.7x faster real-time factor with less than 5% of the original training data.

      Understanding the qualitative intent of citations is essential for a comprehensive assessment of academic research, a task that poses unique challenges for agglutinative languages like Turkish. This paper introduces a systematic methodology and a foundational dataset to address this problem. We first present a new, publicly available dataset of Turkish citation intents, created with a purpose-built annotation tool. We then evaluate the performance of standard In-Context Learning (ICL) with Large Language Models (LLMs), demonstrating that its effectiveness is limited by inconsistent results caused by manually designed prompts. To address this core limitation, we introduce a programmable classification pipeline built on the DSPy framework, which automates prompt optimization systematically. For final classification, we employ a stacked generalization ensemble to aggregate outputs from multiple optimized models, ensuring stable and reliable predictions. This ensemble, with an XGBoost meta-model, achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 91.3\%. Ultimately, this study provides the Turkish NLP community and the broader academic circles with a foundational dataset and a robust classification framework paving the way for future qualitative citation studies.

      As large language models (LLMs) are progressively deployed in various real-world applications, personalization of LLMs has become increasingly important. While various approaches to LLM personalization such as prompt-based and training-based methods have been actively explored, the development of effective decoding-time algorithms remains largely overlooked, despite their demonstrated potential. In this paper, we propose CoPe (Contrasting Personal Preference), a novel decoding-time approach applied after performing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) on user-specific data. Our core idea is to leverage reward-guided decoding specifically for personalization by maximizing each user's implicit reward signal. We evaluate CoPe across five open-ended personalized text generation tasks. Our empirical results demonstrate that CoPe achieves strong performance, improving personalization by an average of 10.57% in ROUGE-L, without relying on external reward models or additional training procedures.

      The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated evaluators (LLM-as-a-judge) has revealed critical inconsistencies in current evaluation frameworks. We identify two fundamental types of inconsistencies: (1) Score-Comparison Inconsistency, where lower-rated responses outperform higher-scored ones in pairwise comparisons, and (2) Pairwise Transitivity Inconsistency, manifested through circular preference chains (A>B>C>A) and equivalence contradictions (A=B=C\neq A). We argue that these issues come from information loss in discrete rating systems and ambiguous tie judgments during pairwise evaluation. We propose TrustJudge, a probabilistic framework that addresses these limitations through two key innovations: 1) distribution-sensitive scoring that computes continuous expectations from discrete rating probabilities, preserving information entropy for more precise scoring, and 2) likelihood-aware aggregation that resolves transitivity violations using bidirectional preference probabilities or perplexity. We also formalize the theoretical limitations of current LLM-as-a-judge frameworks and demonstrate how TrustJudge's components overcome them. When evaluated with Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct as judge using our dataset, TrustJudge reduces Score-Comparison inconsistency by 8.43% (from 23.32% to 14.89%) and Pairwise Transitivity inconsistency by 10.82% (from 15.22% to 4.40%), while maintaining higher evaluation accuracy. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of evaluation framework inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge paradigms, offering both theoretical insights and practical solutions for reliable automated assessment. The framework demonstrates consistent improvements across various model architectures and scales, enabling more trustworthy LLM evaluation without requiring additional training or human annotations.

We study how students with varied expertise use LLMs to complete Python-based data analysis in computational notebooks in a non-major course. Drawing on homework logs, recordings, and surveys from 36 students, we ask: Which expertise matters most, and how does it shape AI use? Our mixed-methods analysis shows that technical expertise -- not AI familiarity or communication skills -- remains a significant predictor of success. Students also vary widely in how they leverage LLMs, struggling at stages of forming intent, expressing inputs, interpreting outputs, and assessing results. We identify success and failure behaviors, such as providing context or decomposing prompts, that distinguish effective use. These findings inform AI literacy interventions, highlighting that lightweight demonstrations improve surface fluency but are insufficient; deeper training and scaffolds are needed to cultivate resilient AI use skills.

      Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted across various applications, leveraging customized system prompts for diverse tasks. Facing potential system prompt leakage risks, model developers have implemented strategies to prevent leakage, primarily by disabling LLMs from repeating their context when encountering known attack patterns. However, it remains vulnerable to new and unforeseen prompt-leaking techniques. In this paper, we first introduce a simple yet effective prompt leaking attack to reveal such risks. Our attack is capable of extracting system prompts from various LLM-based application, even from SOTA LLM models such as GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Our findings further inspire us to search for a fundamental solution to the problems by having no system prompt in the context. To this end, we propose SysVec, a novel method that encodes system prompts as internal representation vectors rather than raw text. By doing so, SysVec minimizes the risk of unauthorized disclosure while preserving the LLM's core language capabilities. Remarkably, this approach not only enhances security but also improves the model's general instruction-following abilities. Experimental results demonstrate that SysVec effectively mitigates prompt leakage attacks, preserves the LLM's functional integrity, and helps alleviate the forgetting issue in long-context scenarios.

      Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a powerful framework for improving the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, current methods such as GRPO rely only on problems where the model responses to the same input differ in correctness, while ignoring those where all responses receive the same reward - so-called zero-variance prompts. In this work, we argue that such prompts are not useless but can, in fact, provide meaningful feedback for policy optimization. To this end, we introduce RL with Zero-Variance Prompts (RL-ZVP), a novel algorithm that extract learning signals from zero-variance prompts. RL-ZVP directly rewards correctness and penalizes errors even without contrasting responses, modulating feedback with token-level characteristics to preserve informative, nuanced signals. Across six math reasoning benchmarks, RL-ZVP achieves significant improvements of up to 8.61 points in accuracy and 7.77 points in pass rate over GRPO, while consistently outperforming other baselines that filter out zero-variance prompts. These results highlight the untapped potential of learning from zero-variance prompts in RLVR.

This paper addresses the question: How can LLM agent simulations be made genuinely useful for policy? We report on a year-long iterative design engagement with a university emergency preparedness team. Across multiple design iterations, we iteratively developed a system of 13,000 LLM agents that simulate crowd movement and communication during a large-scale gathering under various emergency scenarios. These simulations informed actual policy implementation, shaping volunteer training, evacuation protocols, and infrastructure planning. Analyzing this process, we identify three design implications: start with verifiable scenarios and build trust gradually, use preliminary simulations to elicit tacit knowledge, and treat simulation and policy development as evolving together. These implications highlight actionable pathways to making LLM agent simulations that are genuinely useful for policy.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in code generation for popular programming languages. However, their performance on Low-Resource Programming Languages (LRPLs) and Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) remains a significant challenge, affecting millions of developers-3.5 million users in Rust alone-who cannot fully utilize LLM capabilities. LRPLs and DSLs encounter unique obstacles, including data scarcity and, for DSLs, specialized syntax that is poorly represented in general-purpose datasets. Addressing these challenges is crucial, as LRPLs and DSLs enhance development efficiency in specialized domains, such as finance and science. While several surveys discuss LLMs in software engineering, none focus specifically on the challenges and opportunities associated with LRPLs and DSLs. Our survey fills this gap by systematically reviewing the current state, methodologies, and challenges in leveraging LLMs for code generation in these languages. We filtered 111 papers from over 27,000 published studies between 2020 and 2024 to evaluate the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in LRPLs and DSLs. We report the LLMs used, benchmarks, and metrics for evaluation, strategies for enhancing performance, and methods for dataset collection and curation. We identified four main evaluation techniques and several metrics for assessing code generation in LRPLs and DSLs. Our analysis categorizes improvement methods into six groups and summarizes novel architectures proposed by researchers. Despite various techniques and metrics, a standard approach and benchmark dataset for evaluating code generation in LRPLs and DSLs are lacking. This survey serves as a resource for researchers and practitioners at the intersection of LLMs, software engineering, and specialized programming languages, laying the groundwork for future advancements in code generation for LRPLs and DSLs.

      Cascade systems route computational requests to smaller models when possible and defer to larger models only when necessary, offering a promising approach to balance cost and quality in LLM deployment. However, they face a fundamental challenge in open-ended text generation: determining output reliability when generation quality lies on a continuous spectrum, often with multiple valid responses. To address this, we propose semantic agreement -- meaning-level consensus between ensemble outputs -- as a training-free signal for reliable deferral. We show that when diverse model outputs agree semantically, their consensus is a stronger reliability signal than token-level confidence. Evaluated from 500M to 70B-parameter models, we find that semantic cascades match or surpass target-model quality at 40% of the cost and reduce latency by up to 60%. Our method requires no model internals, works across black-box APIs, and remains robust to model updates, making it a practical baseline for real-world LLM deployment.

      Recent benchmarks for Large Language Model (LLM) agents primarily focus on evaluating reasoning, planning, and execution capabilities, while another critical component-memory, encompassing how agents memorize, update, and retrieve long-term information-is under-evaluated due to the lack of benchmarks. We term agents with memory mechanisms as memory agents. In this paper, based on classic theories from memory science and cognitive science, we identify four core competencies essential for memory agents: accurate retrieval, test-time learning, long-range understanding, and selective forgetting. Existing benchmarks either rely on limited context lengths or are tailored for static, long-context settings like book-based QA, which do not reflect the interactive, multi-turn nature of memory agents that incrementally accumulate information. Moreover, no existing benchmarks cover all four competencies. We introduce MemoryAgentBench, a new benchmark specifically designed for memory agents. Our benchmark transforms existing long-context datasets and incorporates newly constructed datasets into a multi-turn format, effectively simulating the incremental information processing characteristic of memory agents. By carefully selecting and curating datasets, our benchmark provides comprehensive coverage of the four core memory competencies outlined above, thereby offering a systematic and challenging testbed for assessing memory quality. We evaluate a diverse set of memory agents, ranging from simple context-based and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to advanced agents with external memory modules and tool integration. Empirical results reveal that current methods fall short of mastering all four competencies, underscoring the need for further research into comprehensive memory mechanisms for LLM agents.

We believe that automating puzzle generation, even for relatively simple puzzles, holds promise for expanding interest in linguistics and introducing the field to a broader audience.

      Many real-world scientific and industrial applications require the optimization of expensive black-box functions. Bayesian Optimization (BO) provides an effective framework for such problems. However, traditional BO methods are prone to get trapped in local optima and often lack interpretable insights. To address this issue, this paper designs Reasoning BO, a novel framework that leverages reasoning models to guide the sampling process in BO while incorporating multi-agent systems and knowledge graphs for online knowledge accumulation. By integrating the reasoning and contextual understanding capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we can provide strong guidance to enhance the BO process. As the optimization progresses, Reasoning BO provides real-time sampling recommendations along with critical insights grounded in plausible scientific theories, aiding in the discovery of superior solutions within the search space. We systematically evaluate our approach across 10 diverse tasks encompassing synthetic mathematical functions and complex real-world applications. The framework demonstrates its capability to progressively refine sampling strategies through real-time insights and hypothesis evolution, effectively identifying higher-performing regions of the search space for focused exploration. This process highlights the powerful reasoning and context-learning abilities of LLMs in optimization scenarios. For example, in the Direct Arylation task, our method increased the yield to 60.7%, whereas traditional BO achieved only a 25.2% yield. Furthermore, our investigation reveals that smaller LLMs, when fine-tuned through reinforcement learning, can attain comparable performance to their larger counterparts.

      Reward models (RMs) are crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs) with diverse cultures. Consequently, evaluating their cultural awareness is essential for further advancing global alignment of LLMs. However, existing RM evaluations fall short in assessing cultural awareness due to the scarcity of culturally relevant evaluation datasets. To fill this gap, we propose Cultural Awareness Reward modeling Benchmark (CARB), covering 10 distinct cultures across 4 cultural domains. Our extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art RMs reveals their deficiencies in modeling cultural awareness and demonstrates a positive correlation between performance on CARB and downstream multilingual cultural alignment tasks. Further analysis identifies the spurious correlations within culture-aware reward modeling, wherein RM's scoring relies predominantly on surface-level features rather than authentic cultural nuance understanding. To address these, we propose Think-as-Locals to elicit deeper culturally grounded reasoning from generative RMs via reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) and employ well-designed rewards to ensure accurate preference judgments and high-quality structured evaluation criteria generation. Experimental results validate its efficacy in mitigating spurious features interference and advancing culture-aware reward modeling.

      Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable potential in medical applications, yet they face substantial challenges in handling complex real-world clinical diagnoses using conventional prompting methods. Current prompt engineering and multi-agent approaches typically optimize isolated inferences, neglecting the accumulation of reusable clinical experience. To address this, this study proposes a novel Multi-Agent Clinical Diagnosis (MACD) framework, which allows LLMs to self-learn clinical knowledge via a multi-agent pipeline that summarizes, refines, and applies diagnostic insights. It mirrors how physicians develop expertise through experience, enabling more focused and accurate diagnosis on key disease-specific cues. We further extend it to a MACD-human collaborative workflow, where multiple LLM-based diagnostician agents engage in iterative consultations, supported by an evaluator agent and human oversight for cases where agreement is not reached. Evaluated on 4,390 real-world patient cases across seven diseases using diverse open-source LLMs (Llama-3.1 8B/70B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama 70B), MACD significantly improves primary diagnostic accuracy, outperforming established clinical guidelines with gains up to 22.3% (MACD). In direct comparison with physician-only diagnosis under the same evaluation protocol, MACD achieves comparable or superior performance, with improvements up to 16%. Furthermore, the MACD-human workflow yields an 18.6% improvement over physician-only diagnosis, demonstrating the synergistic potential of human-AI collaboration. Notably, the self-learned clinical knowledge exhibits strong cross-model stability, transferability across LLMs, and capacity for model-specific personalization.This work thus presents a scalable self-learning paradigm that bridges the gap between the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs.

      Low-bit post-training quantization (PTQ) is a practical route to deploy reasoning-capable LLMs under tight memory and latency budgets, yet it can markedly impair mathematical reasoning (drops up to 69.81% in our harder settings). We address two deployment-critical questions with process-level precision: Where along a step-structured solution does degradation first arise? How to mitigate it while staying in the low-bit regime? Across widely used PTQ methods (AWQ, GPTQ, SmoothQuant), open-source model families (Qwen, LLaMA; 0.5--7B), and math reasoning benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH, AIME), we perform format-aligned chain-of-thought with step-aligned attribution and uncover two robust regularities: (i) PTQ disproportionately elevates method and execution errors relative to high-level conceptual mistakes; and (ii) failures emerge early, with the first vulnerable step flipping and cascading to the final answer. These regularities suggest a general intervention principle: restore local token-level margins exactly at the earliest failure frontier. We instantiate this principle as a lightweight measure$\rightarrow$locate$\rightarrow$restore loop that operates directly on the quantized model: detect the first faulty step, construct our "Silver Bullet" datasets, and apply small-scale supervised/preference tuning. In our settings, as few as 332 curated examples and 3--5 minutes of compute on a single GPU recover 4-bit weight math reasoning toward the full-precision baseline while preserving PTQ efficiency. Our framework is quantizer- and architecture-agnostic within the evaluated regimes, and turns low-bit degradation from a global accuracy problem into a local, reproducible process intervention.

      Current evaluation paradigms for large language models (LLMs) suffer from overestimated or biased evaluations and mismatched question difficulty, leading to incomplete evaluations of knowledge and capability boundaries, which hinder their effective application and optimization. To address these challenges, we propose Agent-as-Interviewer, a dynamic evaluation paradigm that employs LLM agents to conduct multi-turn interactions for evaluation. Unlike current benchmarking or dynamic interaction paradigms, Agent-as-Interviewer utilizes agents to invoke knowledge tools for wider and deeper knowledge in the dynamic multi-turn question generation, achieving more comprehensive evaluations of LLM's knowledge boundaries. It also leverages agents to plan query strategies for adjustment of the question difficulty levels, enhancing the difficulty control to match the actual capabilities of target LLMs. Based on this paradigm, we develop JudgeAgent, a knowledge-wise dynamic evaluation framework that employs knowledge-driven synthesis as the agent's tool and uses difficulty scoring as strategy guidance, thereby finally providing valuable suggestions to help targets optimize themselves. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of JudgeAgent's suggestions, demonstrating that Agent-as-Interviewer can accurately identify the knowledge and capability boundaries of target models.

      Using language models to scalably approximate human preferences on text quality (LLM-as-a-judge) has become a standard practice applicable to many tasks. A judgment is often extracted from the judge's textual output alone, typically with greedy decoding. However, LLM judges naturally provide distributions over judgment tokens, inviting a breadth of inference methods for extracting fine-grained preferences. We find that taking the mean of the judgment distribution consistently outperforms taking the mode (i.e. greedy decoding) in all evaluation settings (i.e. pointwise, pairwise, and listwise). We further explore novel methods of deriving preferences from judgment distributions, and find that methods incorporating risk aversion often improve performance. Lastly, we analyze LLM-as-a-judge paired with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, showing that CoT can collapse the spread of the judgment distribution, often harming performance. Our findings show that leveraging distributional output improves LLM-as-a-judge, as opposed to using the text interface alone.

      Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) for question answering (QA) over lengthy contexts is a significant challenge. In industrial settings, this process is often hindered by high computational costs and latency, especially when multiple questions must be answered based on the same context. In this work, we explore the capabilities of LLMs to answer multiple questions based on the same conversational context. We conduct extensive experiments and benchmark a range of both proprietary and public models on this challenging task. Our findings highlight that while strong proprietary LLMs like GPT-4o achieve the best overall performance, fine-tuned public LLMs with up to 8 billion parameters can surpass GPT-4o in accuracy, which demonstrates their potential for transparent and cost-effective deployment in real-world applications.

      Domain-adaptive post-training of large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising approach for specialized domains such as medicine and finance. However, significant challenges remain in identifying optimal adaptation criteria and training strategies across varying data and model configurations. To address these challenges, we introduce FINDAP, a systematic and fine-grained investigation into domain-adaptive post-training of LLMs for the finance domain. Our approach consists of four key components: FinCap, which defines the core capabilities required for the target domain; FinRec, an effective training recipe that jointly optimizes continual pre-training and instruction-following, along with a novel preference data distillation method leveraging process signals from a generative reward model; FinTrain, a curated set of training datasets supporting FinRec; and FinEval, a comprehensive evaluation suite aligned with FinCap. The resulting model, Llama-Fin, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of financial tasks. Our analysis also highlights how each post-training stage contributes to distinct capabilities, uncovering specific challenges and effective solutions, providing valuable insights for domain adaptation of LLMs

      Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), particularly those enhanced through reinforced post-training, have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities, as exemplified by models such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1. However, these capabilities are predominantly benchmarked on domains like mathematical problem solving and code generation, leaving open the question of whether such reasoning skills generalize to complex real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce LocationReasoner, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' reasoning abilities in the context of real-world site selection, where models must identify feasible locations by reasoning over diverse and complicated spatial, environmental, and logistic constraints. The benchmark covers carefully crafted queries of varying difficulty levels and is supported by a sandbox environment with in-house tools for constraint-based location search. Automated verification further guarantees the scalability of the benchmark, enabling the addition of arbitrary number of queries. Extensive evaluations on real-world site selection data from Boston, New York, and Tampa reveal that state-of-the-art reasoning models offer limited improvement over their non-reasoning predecessors in real-world contexts, with even the latest OpenAI o4 model failing on 30% of site selection tasks. Moreover, agentic strategies such as ReAct and Reflexion often suffer from over-reasoning, leading to worse outcomes than direct prompting. With key limitations of LLMs in holistic and non-linear reasoning highlighted, we release LocationReasoner to foster the development of LLMs and agents capable of robust, grounded reasoning in real-world decision-making tasks.

      Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Graph-based RAG has become the important paradigm for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with external knowledge. However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off. While graph-based methods are inherently dependent on high-quality graph structures, they face significant practical constraints: manually constructed knowledge graphs are prohibitively expensive to scale, while automatically extracted graphs from corpora are limited by the performance of the underlying LLM extractors, especially when using smaller, local-deployed models. This paper presents Think-on-Graph 3.0 (ToG-3), a novel framework that introduces Multi-Agent Context Evolution and Retrieval (MACER) mechanism to overcome these limitations. Our core innovation is the dynamic construction and refinement of a Chunk-Triplets-Community heterogeneous graph index, which pioneeringly incorporates a dual-evolution mechanism of Evolving Query and Evolving Sub-Graph for precise evidence retrieval. This approach addresses a critical limitation of prior Graph-based RAG methods, which typically construct a static graph index in a single pass without adapting to the actual query. A multi-agent system, comprising Constructor, Retriever, Reflector, and Responser agents, collaboratively engages in an iterative process of evidence retrieval, answer generation, sufficiency reflection, and, crucially, evolving query and subgraph. This dual-evolving multi-agent system allows ToG-3 to adaptively build a targeted graph index during reasoning, mitigating the inherent drawbacks of static, one-time graph construction and enabling deep, precise reasoning even with lightweight LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ToG-3 outperforms compared baselines on both deep and broad reasoning benchmarks, and ablation studies confirm the efficacy of the components of MACER framework.

      Deploying black-box LLMs requires managing uncertainty in the absence of token-level probability or true labels. We propose introducing an unsupervised conformal inference framework for generation, which integrates: generative models, incorporating: (i) an LLM-compatible atypical score derived from response-embedding Gram matrix, (ii) UCP combined with a bootstrapping variant (BB-UCP) that aggregates residuals to refine quantile precision while maintaining distribution-free, finite-sample coverage, and (iii) conformal alignment, which calibrates a single strictness parameter $\tau$ so a user predicate (e.g., factuality lift) holds on unseen batches with probability $\ge 1-\alpha$. Across different benchmark datasets, our gates achieve close-to-nominal coverage and provide tighter, more stable thresholds than split UCP, while consistently reducing the severity of hallucination, outperforming lightweight per-response detectors with similar computational demands. The result is a label-free, API-compatible gate for test-time filtering that turns geometric signals into calibrated, goal-aligned decisions.

In this work, we reveal a new side-channel whereby input-dependent patterns of correct and incorrect speculations can be inferred by monitoring per-iteration token counts or packet sizes.We demonstrate that an adversary observing these patterns can fingerprint user queries with >90% accuracy across four speculative-decoding schemes, REST (100\%), LADE (up to 92%), BiLD (up to 95%), and EAGLE (up to 77.6%) and leak confidential datastore contents used for prediction at rates exceeding 25 tokens/sec. We evaluate the side-channel attacks in both research prototypes as well as the production-grade vLLM serving framework. To defend against these, we propose and evaluate a suite of mitigations, including packet padding and iteration-wise token aggregation.

These generated corpora replicate reference human corpora: BE21 by Paul Baker, which is a modern version of the original Brown Corpus, and Koditex corpus that also follows the Brown Corpus tradition but in Czech. The new corpora were generated using models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Alphabet, Meta, and DeepSeek, ranging from GPT-3 (davinci-002) to GPT-4.5, and are tagged according to the Universal Dependencies standard (i.e., they are tokenized, lemmatized, and morphologically and syntactically annotated).

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically examine LLM capabilities in biography, a critical yet underexplored dimension of factual knowledge. At its core, AdamDB is a multilingual and multimodal dataset covering over 4 million individuals across geography, time, and profession, while AdamBench provides cognitively structured evaluations based on Bloom's taxonomy, spanning six reasoning levels in both English and native languages. To address hallucinations, particularly for lesser-known individuals, we propose AdamRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation system tailored to biographical contexts. Experiments show that AdamRAG substantially improves open-source models and modestly benefits closed-source ones, with the largest gains on lower-order reasoning. Popularity strongly mediates accuracy, and multimodal input via face images offers smaller, less consistent improvements than retrieval. ADAM establishes the first benchmark and framework for cognitively, culturally, and multimodally grounded biographical evaluation, advancing the development of multilingual, accurate, and hallucination-resistant MLLMs.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) vary widely in their capabilities, with larger models often having better performance but higher cost: choosing an LLM model often involves trading off performance and cost. The LLM Cascade is a paradigm that defers difficult queries from weak/cheap to strong/expensive models. This approach is nonadaptive: the deferral decision is trained offline. When confronted with similar or repeated queries, the LLM Cascade may then repeatedly consult the expensive model and incur higher cost. To improve the cascading efficiency, we propose Inter-Cascade, an online and interactive LLM Cascade that extends the role of strong model from a backup helper to a long-term teacher. In our system, when a strong model resolves a difficult query, it also distills its solution into a generalized, reusable problem-solving strategy that boosts the weak model on subsequent queries. Adding strategies to queries enables the weak model to dynamically improve its performance over time, avoiding computationally and time-intensive fine-tuning. Empirically, compared with standard LLM Cascade baselines across multiple benchmarks, the Inter-Cascade significantly improves the accuracy of the weak model (by up to 33.06 absolute percentage points) and the overall system (by up to 5.53 absolute percentage points), while reducing the calls to strong models (by up to 48.05% relative reduction) and saving the corresponding fees (by up to 49.63% relative reduction). Inter-Cascade demonstrates the effective in-context knowledge transfer between LLMs, and provides a general, scalable framework applicable to both open-source and API-based LLMs.

      Mathematical programming -- the task of expressing operations and decision-making problems in precise mathematical language -- is fundamental across domains, yet remains a skill-intensive process requiring operations research expertise. Recent advances in large language models for complex reasoning have spurred interest in automating this task, translating natural language into executable optimization models. Current approaches, however, achieve limited accuracy, hindered by scarce and noisy training data without leveraging domain knowledge. In this work, we systematically integrate optimization expertise to improve formulation accuracy for mixed-integer linear programming, a key family of mathematical programs. Our approach first cleans training data through class-based error analysis to explicitly prevent common mistakes within each optimization class. We then develop multi-turn inference strategies that guide LLMs with class-specific error summaries and solver feedback, enabling iterative refinement. Experiments across multiple base LLMs demonstrate that combining cleaned data with domain-informed prompting and feedback improves formulation accuracy by 14 percentage points on average, enabling further progress toward robust LLM-assisted optimization formulation.

      Recent studies highlight various machine learning (ML)-based techniques for code clone detection, which can be integrated into developer tools such as static code analysis. With the advancements brought by ML in code understanding, ML-based code clone detectors could accurately identify and classify cloned pairs, especially semantic clones, but often operate as black boxes, providing little insight into the decision-making process. Post hoc explainers, on the other hand, aim to interpret and explain the predictions of these ML models after they are made, offering a way to understand the underlying mechanisms driving the model's decisions. However, current post hoc techniques require white-box access to the ML model or are computationally expensive, indicating a need for advanced post hoc explainers. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages the in-context learning capabilities of large language models to elucidate the predictions made by the ML-based code clone detectors. We perform a study using ChatGPT-4 to explain the code clone results inferred by GraphCodeBERT. We found that our approach is promising as a post hoc explainer by giving the correct explanations up to 98% and offering good explanations 95% of the time. However, the explanations and the code line examples given by the LLM are useful in some cases. We also found that lowering the temperature to zero helps increase the accuracy of the explanation. Lastly, we list the insights that can lead to further improvements in future work. This study paves the way for future studies in using LLMs as a post hoc explainer for various software engineering tasks.

      Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly becoming core tools for science, engineering, and innovation. Their promise lies not just in remembering facts, but in putting knowledge to work. Despite their impressive ability to answer increasingly difficult questions, it remains unclear whether LLMs truly use their knowledge when confronted with new and challenging tasks. We address this question with a patent classification task that requires deep conceptual understanding: distinguishing objectively different but semantically similar patents. To evaluate this approach, we introduce a challenging new benchmark of 1.3 million post-2015 computer science patent pairs, characterized by dense technical jargon and strategically complex writing. We find that LLMs often fail our benchmark and struggle to distinguish among semantically similar patents. To probe this failure, we introduce a novel framework that decomposes model errors into two sources: missing and unused knowledge. Our approach asks models to generate clarifying questions to improve their understanding, and then compares three settings: raw performance, self-answered questions, and externally supplied answers. This decomposition reveals that LLMs often possess the relevant knowledge internally but fail to deploy it, while a smaller share of errors arises from genuine knowledge gaps. We then ask whether the ability of models to construct a task-specific database of questions and answers differs across models. We find that smaller models generate simpler, broadly transferable questions, while larger models propose more complex but less generalizable ones. This suggests new strategies for combining strengths across models. Our findings highlight a critical limitation of current LLMs and their evaluation: models often know more than they can use. LLM evaluation should shift from recall of static facts to application of dynamic knowledge.

      As Generative AI (GenAI) systems see growing adoption, a key concern involves the external validity of evaluations, or the extent to which they generalize from lab-based to real-world deployment conditions. Threats to the external validity of GenAI evaluations arise when the source sample of human raters and system outputs used to obtain a system quality estimate differs from the target distribution at deployment time. In this work, we propose a doubly-robust estimation framework designed to address this evaluation sampling bias. Key to our approach is the use of "persona" ratings produced by prompting an LLM evaluator (i.e., an LLM-as-a-judge) to behave as a human rater with specific sociodemographic characteristics. Our doubly-robust framework combines these informative yet imperfect persona ratings with human ratings obtained under evaluation sampling bias to produce statistically valid system quality estimates. In particular, we show that our approach yields valid system quality estimates when either (i) a model trained to predict human ratings using persona ratings and source data observed under sampling bias, or (ii) a reweighting model that corrects for sampling bias is of sufficient quality. We validate our framework theoretically and via a novel Persona Simulation Framework (PSF) designed to systematically manipulate persona quality and the degree of evaluation sampling bias present in source data. Our work provides a principled foundation for combining imperfect persona ratings with human ratings observed under sampling bias to obtain valid system quality estimates.

      Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trusted as automated judges, assisting evaluation and providing reward signals for training other models, particularly in reference-based settings like Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). However, we uncover a critical vulnerability even in this reference-based paradigm: generative reward models are systematically susceptible to reward hacking. We find that superficial inputs, which we term ''master keys'' such as non-word symbols (e.g., '':'' or ''.'') or generic reasoning openers (e.g., ''Thought process:'' or ''Let's solve this problem step by step.''), can consistently elicit false positive rewards without any substantive reasoning. Our systematic evaluation demonstrates this is a widespread failure affecting a diverse range of models, including leading proprietary systems such as GPT-o1 and Claude-4. These results challenge the assumed robustness of LLM judges and pose a significant threat to their reliability. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy using truncated model outputs as adversarial negative examples. The resulting Master Reward Models (Master-RMs) demonstrate state-of-the-art robustness against these ''master key'' attacks while maintaining high performance in standard evaluation settings. We supplement these findings with a comprehensive analysis of the vulnerability across model scales, prompt variations, and common inference-time strategies, offering insights to guide future research on robust LLM evaluation.

      Generative AI has established the opportunity to readily transform content from one medium to another. This capability is especially powerful for storytelling, where visual illustrations can illuminate a story originally expressed in text. In this paper, we focus on the task of narrative scene illustration, which involves automatically generating an image depicting a scene in a story. Motivated by recent progress on text-to-image models, we consider a pipeline that uses LLMs as an interface for prompting text-to-image models to generate scene illustrations given raw story text. We apply variations of this pipeline to a prominent story corpus in order to synthesize illustrations for scenes in these stories. We conduct a human annotation task to obtain pairwise quality judgments for these illustrations. The outcome of this process is the SceneIllustrations dataset, which we release as a new resource for future work on cross-modal narrative transformation. Through our analysis of this dataset and experiments modeling illustration quality, we demonstrate that LLMs can effectively verbalize scene knowledge implicitly evoked by story text. Moreover, this capability is impactful for generating and evaluating illustrations.

      Standard LLM evaluation practices compress diverse abilities into single scores, obscuring their inherently multidimensional nature. We present JE-IRT, a geometric item-response framework that embeds both LLMs and questions in a shared space. For question embeddings, the direction encodes semantics and the norm encodes difficulty, while correctness on each question is determined by the geometric interaction between the model and question embeddings. This geometry replaces a global ranking of LLMs with topical specialization and enables smooth variation across related questions. Building on this framework, our experimental results reveal that out-of-distribution behavior can be explained through directional alignment, and that larger norms consistently indicate harder questions. Moreover, JE-IRT naturally supports generalization: once the space is learned, new LLMs are added by fitting a single embedding. The learned space further reveals an LLM-internal taxonomy that only partially aligns with human-defined subject categories. JE-IRT thus establishes a unified and interpretable geometric lens that connects LLM abilities with the structure of questions, offering a distinctive perspective on model evaluation and generalization.

In this work, we demonstrate that LLMs that explicitly use ToM get better at dialogue, achieving goals more effectively. After showing that simply prompting models to generate mental states between dialogue turns already provides significant benefit, we further introduce ToMAgent (ToMA), a ToM-focused dialogue agent. ToMA is trained by pairing ToM with dialogue lookahead to produce mental states that are maximally useful for achieving dialogue goals. Experiments on the Sotopia interactive social evaluation benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over a range of baselines. Comprehensive analysis shows that ToMA exhibits more strategic, goal-oriented reasoning behaviors, which enable long-horizon adaptation, while maintaining better relationships with their partners. Our results suggest a step forward in integrating ToM for building socially intelligent LLM agents.

      As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in real-world decision-making processes, it becomes crucial to examine the extent to which they exhibit cognitive biases. Extensively studied in the field of psychology, cognitive biases appear as systematic distortions commonly observed in human judgments. This paper presents a large-scale evaluation of eight well-established cognitive biases across 45 LLMs, analyzing over 2.8 million LLM responses generated through controlled prompt variations. To achieve this, we introduce a novel evaluation framework based on multiple-choice tasks, hand-curate a dataset of 220 decision scenarios targeting fundamental cognitive biases in collaboration with psychologists, and propose a scalable approach for generating diverse prompts from human-authored scenario templates. Our analysis shows that LLMs exhibit bias-consistent behavior in 17.8-57.3% of instances across a range of judgment and decision-making contexts targeting anchoring, availability, confirmation, framing, interpretation, overattribution, prospect theory, and representativeness biases. We find that both model size and prompt specificity play a significant role on bias susceptibility as follows: larger size (>32B parameters) can reduce bias in 39.5% of cases, while higher prompt detail reduces most biases by up to 14.9%, except in one case (Overattribution), which is exacerbated by up to 8.8%.

      Training Large Language Models(LLMs) is one of the most compute-intensive tasks in high-performance computing. Predicting end-to-end training time for multi-billion parameter models distributed across hundreds of GPUs remains challenging due to complex interactions between transformer components, parallelism strategies(data, model, pipeline, tensor), and multi-tier communication. Learned models require costly sampling, while analytical models often struggle with real-world network and hardware complexities. We address this by decomposing LLMs into core computational primitives and modeling them with: (1) operator-level decomposition for fine-grained analysis; (2) lightweight sampling based hardware-aware prediction models for key operations; (3) an end-to-end prediction system integrating these components across complex parallelization strategies. Crucially, our methodology has been validated on two large-scale HPC systems. Our framework achieves low average prediction errors-4.98\% on Perlmutter(A100) and 9.38\% on Vista(GH200)-for models up to 20B parameters across 128 GPUs. Importantly, it runs entirely on CPUs, enabling rapid iteration over hardware configurations and training strategies without costly on-cluster experimentation.

      Research on Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly focuses on identifying mechanistic explanations for their behaviors, yet the field lacks clear principles for determining when (and how) findings from one model instance generalize to another. This paper addresses a fundamental epistemological challenge: given a mechanistic claim about a particular model, what justifies extrapolating this finding to other LLMs -- and along which dimensions might such generalizations hold? I propose five potential axes of correspondence along which mechanistic claims might generalize, including: functional (whether they satisfy the same functional criteria), developmental (whether they develop at similar points during pretraining), positional (whether they occupy similar absolute or relative positions), relational (whether they interact with other model components in similar ways), and configurational (whether they correspond to particular regions or structures in weight-space). To empirically validate this framework, I analyze "1-back attention heads" (components attending to previous tokens) across pretraining in random seeds of the Pythia models (14M, 70M, 160M, 410M). The results reveal striking consistency in the developmental trajectories of 1-back attention across models, while positional consistency is more limited. Moreover, seeds of larger models systematically show earlier onsets, steeper slopes, and higher peaks of 1-back attention. I also address possible objections to the arguments and proposals outlined here. Finally, I conclude by arguing that progress on the generalizability of mechanistic interpretability research will consist in mapping constitutive design properties of LLMs to their emergent behaviors and mechanisms.

      Large language models (LLMs) acquire extensive prior knowledge through large-scale pretraining and can be further enhanced via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training. A growing body of evidence has shown that RL fine-tuning improves the capability of LLMs beyond what SFT alone achieves. However, the underlying mechanisms why RL fine-tuning is able to enhance the capability of various LLMs with distinct intrinsic characteristics remain underexplored. In this study, we draw inspiration from prior work on edge attribution patching (EAP) to investigate the internal differences of LLMs before and after RL fine-tuning. Our analysis across multiple model families shows two robust effects of online RL post-training: (i) an overall increase in activation intensity, indicating that more internal pathways are engaged and their signals become stronger, and (ii) greater diversity in activation patterns, reflected by higher entropy and less concentrated edge distributions. These changes suggest that RL reshapes information flow to be both more redundant and more flexible, which may explain its advantage in generalization. Notably, models fine-tuned with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) deviate from these trends, exhibiting substantially weaker or inconsistent internal changes compared to PPO- and GRPO-based training. Together, our findings provide a unified view of how RL fine-tuning systematically alters the internal circuitry of LLMs and highlight the methodological distinctions between online RL and preference-based approaches.

      This paper defines and explores the design space for information extraction (IE) from layout-rich documents using large language models (LLMs). The three core challenges of layout-aware IE with LLMs are 1) data structuring, 2) model engagement, and 3) output refinement. Our study investigates the sub-problems and methods within these core challenges, such as input representation, chunking, prompting, selection of LLMs, and multimodal models. It examines the effect of different design choices through LayIE-LLM, a new, open-source, layout-aware IE test suite, benchmarking against traditional, fine-tuned IE models. The results on two IE datasets show that LLMs require adjustment of the IE pipeline to achieve competitive performance: the optimized configuration found with LayIE-LLM achieves 13.3--37.5 F1 points more than a general-practice baseline configuration using the same LLM. To find a well-working configuration, we develop a one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) method that achieves near-optimal results. Our method is only 0.8--1.8 points lower than the best full factorial exploration with a fraction (2.8%) of the required computation. Overall, we demonstrate that, if well-configured, general-purpose LLMs match the performance of specialized models, providing a cost-effective, finetuning-free alternative.

      It remains an open question whether LLMs can acquire or generalize genuinely new reasoning strategies, beyond the sharpened skills encoded in their parameters during pre-training or post-training. To attempt to answer this debate, we introduce DELTA-Code--Distributional Evaluation of Learnability and Transferrability in Algorithmic Coding, a controlled benchmark of synthetic coding problem families designed to probe two fundamental aspects: learnability -- can LLMs, through reinforcement learning (RL), solve problem families where pretrained models exhibit failure with large enough attempts (pass@K=0)? --and transferrability -- if learnability happens, can such skills transfer systematically to out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets? Unlike prior public coding datasets, DELTA isolates reasoning skills through templated problem generators and introduces fully OOD problem families that demand novel strategies rather than tool invocation or memorized patterns. Our experiments reveal a striking grokking phase transition: after an extended period with near-zero reward, RL-trained models abruptly climb to near-perfect accuracy. To enable learnability on previously unsolvable problem families, we explore key training ingredients such as staged warm-up with dense rewards, experience replay, curriculum training, and verification-in-the-loop. Beyond learnability, we use DELTA to evaluate transferability or generalization along exploratory, compositional, and transformative axes, as well as cross-family transfer. Results show solid gains within families and for recomposed skills, but persistent weaknesses in transformative cases. DELTA thus offers a clean testbed for probing the limits of RL-driven reasoning and for understanding how models can move beyond existing priors to acquire new algorithmic skills.

      The remarkable capability of large language models (LLMs) has led to the wide application of LLM-based agents in various domains. To standardize interactions between LLM-based agents and their environments, model context protocol (MCP) tools have become the de facto standard and are now widely integrated into these agents. However, the incorporation of MCP tools introduces the risk of tool poisoning attacks, which can manipulate the behavior of LLM-based agents. Although previous studies have identified such vulnerabilities, their red teaming approaches have largely remained at the proof-of-concept stage, leaving the automatic and systematic red teaming of LLM-based agents under the MCP tool poisoning paradigm an open question. To bridge this gap, we propose AutoMalTool, an automated red teaming framework for LLM-based agents by generating malicious MCP tools. Our extensive evaluation shows that AutoMalTool effectively generates malicious MCP tools capable of manipulating the behavior of mainstream LLM-based agents while evading current detection mechanisms, thereby revealing new security risks in these agents.

      Efficient path planning in robotics, particularly within large-scale, complex environments, remains a significant hurdle. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning capabilities, their high computational cost and limited adaptability hinder real-time deployment on edge devices. We present SmallPlan - a novel framework leveraging LLMs as teacher models to train lightweight Small Language Models (SLMs) for high-level path planning tasks. In SmallPlan, the SLMs provide optimal action sequences to navigate across scene graphs that compactly represent full-scaled 3D scenes. The SLMs are trained in a simulation-powered, interleaved manner with LLM-guided supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). This strategy not only enables SLMs to successfully complete navigation tasks but also makes them aware of important factors like distance travel, providing more efficient path planning. Through experiments, we demonstrate that the fine-tuned SLMs perform competitively with larger models like GPT-4o on sequential path planning, without suffering from hallucination and overfitting. SmallPlan is resource-efficient, making it well-suited for edge-device deployment and advancing practical autonomous robotics.

      Despite rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs), the token-level autoregressive nature constrains their complex reasoning capabilities. To enhance LLM reasoning, inference-time techniques, including Chain/Tree/Graph-of-Thought(s), successfully improve the performance, as they are fairly cost-effective by guiding reasoning through sophisticated logical structures without modifying LLMs' parameters. However, these manually predefined, task-agnostic frameworks are applied uniformly across diverse tasks, lacking adaptability. To improve this, we propose RL-of-Thoughts (RLoT), where we train a lightweight navigator model with reinforcement learning (RL) to adaptively enhance LLM reasoning at inference time. Specifically, we design five basic logic blocks from the perspective of human cognition. During the reasoning process, the trained RL navigator dynamically selects the suitable logic blocks and combines them into task-specific logical structures according to problem characteristics. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks (AIME, MATH, GPQA, etc.) with multiple LLMs (GPT, Llama, Qwen, and DeepSeek) illustrate that RLoT outperforms established inference-time techniques by up to 13.4%. Remarkably, with less than 3K parameters, our RL navigator is able to make sub-10B LLMs comparable to 100B-scale counterparts. Moreover, the RL navigator demonstrates strong transferability: a model trained on one specific LLM-task pair can effectively generalize to unseen LLMs and tasks.

      Large language models (LLMs) excel at language understanding and generation, but their enormous computational and memory requirements hinder deployment. Compression offers a potential solution to mitigate these constraints. However, most existing methods rely on fixed heuristics and thus fail to adapt to runtime memory variations or heterogeneous KV-cache demands arising from diverse user requests. To address these limitations, we propose RAP, an elastic pruning framework driven by reinforcement learning (RL) that dynamically adjusts compression strategies in a runtime-aware manner. Specifically, RAP dynamically tracks the evolving ratio between model parameters and KV-cache across practical execution. Recognizing that FFNs house most parameters, whereas parameter -light attention layers dominate KV-cache formation, the RL agent retains only those components that maximize utility within the current memory budget, conditioned on instantaneous workload and device state. Extensive experiments results demonstrate that RAP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, marking the first time to jointly consider model weights and KV-cache on the fly.

      Retrosynthesis planning enables the discovery of viable synthetic routes for target molecules, playing a crucial role in domains like drug discovery and materials design. Multi-step retrosynthetic planning remains computationally challenging due to exponential search spaces and inference costs. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate chemical reasoning capabilities, their application to synthesis planning faces constraints on efficiency and cost. To address these challenges, we introduce AOT*, a framework that transforms retrosynthetic planning by integrating LLM-generated chemical synthesis pathways with systematic AND-OR tree search. To this end, AOT* atomically maps the generated complete synthesis routes onto AND-OR tree components, with a mathematically sound design of reward assignment strategy and retrieval-based context engineering, thus enabling LLMs to efficiently navigate in the chemical space. Experimental evaluation on multiple synthesis benchmarks demonstrates that AOT* achieves SOTA performance with significantly improved search efficiency. AOT* exhibits competitive solve rates using 3-5$\times$ fewer iterations than existing LLM-based approaches, with the efficiency advantage becoming more pronounced on complex molecular targets.

      Large language models (LLMs) can act as evaluators, a role studied by methods like LLM-as-a-Judge and fine-tuned judging LLMs. In the field of education, LLMs have been studied as assistant tools for students and teachers. Our research investigates LLM-driven automatic evaluation systems for academic Text-Input Problems using rubrics. We propose five evaluation systems that have been tested on a custom dataset of 110 answers about computer science from higher education students with three models: JudgeLM, Llama-3.1-8B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B. The evaluation systems include: The JudgeLM evaluation, which uses the model's single answer prompt to obtain a score; Reference Aided Evaluation, which uses a correct answer as a guide aside from the original context of the question; No Reference Evaluation, which ommits the reference answer; Additive Evaluation, which uses atomic criteria; and Adaptive Evaluation, which is an evaluation done with generated criteria fitted to each question. All evaluation methods have been compared with the results of a human evaluator. Results show that the best method to automatically evaluate and score Text-Input Problems using LLMs is Reference Aided Evaluation. With the lowest median absolute deviation (0.945) and the lowest root mean square deviation (1.214) when compared to human evaluation, Reference Aided Evaluation offers fair scoring as well as insightful and complete evaluations. Other methods such as Additive and Adaptive Evaluation fail to provide good results in concise answers, No Reference Evaluation lacks information needed to correctly assess questions and JudgeLM Evaluations have not provided good results due to the model's limitations. As a result, we conclude that Artificial Intelligence-driven automatic evaluation systems, aided with proper methodologies, show potential to work as complementary tools to other academic resources.

      The LLM unlearning aims to eliminate the influence of undesirable data without affecting causally unrelated information. This process typically involves using a forget set to remove target information, alongside a retain set to maintain non-target capabilities. While recent localization-based methods demonstrate promise in identifying important neurons to be unlearned, they fail to disentangle neurons responsible for forgetting undesirable knowledge or retaining essential skills, often treating them as a single entangled group. As a result, these methods apply uniform interventions, risking catastrophic over-forgetting or incomplete erasure of the target knowledge. To address this, we turn to circuit discovery, a mechanistic interpretability technique, and propose the Conflict-guided Localization for LLM Unlearning framEwork (CLUE). This framework identifies the forget and retain circuit composed of important neurons, and then the circuits are transformed into conjunctive normal forms (CNF). The assignment of each neuron in the CNF satisfiability solution reveals whether it should be forgotten or retained. We then provide targeted fine-tuning strategies for different categories of neurons. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to existing localization methods, CLUE achieves superior forget efficacy and retain utility through precise neural localization.

      As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in highly specialized vertical domains, the evaluation of their domain-specific performance becomes critical. However, existing evaluations for vertical domains typically rely on the labor-intensive construction of static single-turn datasets, which present two key limitations: (i) manual data construction is costly and must be repeated for each new domain, and (ii) static single-turn evaluations are misaligned with the dynamic multi-turn interactions in real-world applications, limiting the assessment of professionalism and stability. To address these, we propose TestAgent, a framework for automatic benchmarking and exploratory dynamic evaluation in vertical domains. TestAgent leverages retrieval-augmented generation to create domain-specific questions from user-provided knowledge sources, combined with a two-stage criteria generation process, thereby enabling scalable and automated benchmark creation. Furthermore, it introduces a reinforcement learning-guided multi-turn interaction strategy that adaptively determines question types based on real-time model responses, dynamically probing knowledge boundaries and stability. Extensive experiments across medical, legal, and governmental domains demonstrate that TestAgent enables efficient cross-domain benchmark generation and yields deeper insights into model behavior through dynamic exploratory evaluation. This work establishes a new paradigm for automated and in-depth evaluation of LLMs in vertical domains.

      With the proliferation of large language model (LLM) variants, developers are turning to serverless computing for cost-efficient LLM deployment. However, public cloud providers often struggle to provide performance guarantees for serverless LLM serving due to significant cold start latency caused by substantial model sizes and complex runtime dependencies. To address this problem, we present HydraServe, a serverless LLM serving system designed to minimize cold start latency in public clouds. HydraServe proactively distributes models across servers to quickly fetch them, and overlaps cold-start stages within workers to reduce startup latency. Additionally, HydraServe strategically places workers across GPUs to avoid network contention among cold-start instances. To minimize resource consumption during cold starts, HydraServe further introduces pipeline consolidation that can merge groups of workers into individual serving endpoints. Our comprehensive evaluations under diverse settings demonstrate that HydraServe reduces the cold start latency by 1.7$\times$-- 4.7$\times$ and improves service level objective attainment by 1.43$\times$--1.74$\times$ compared to baselines.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) watermarking has shown promise in detecting AI-generated content and mitigating misuse, with prior work claiming robustness against paraphrasing and text editing. In this paper, we argue that existing evaluations are not sufficiently adversarial, obscuring critical vulnerabilities and overstating the security. To address this, we introduce adaptive robustness radius, a formal metric that quantifies watermark resilience against adaptive adversaries. We theoretically prove that optimizing the attack context and model parameters can substantially reduce this radius, making watermarks highly susceptible to paraphrase attacks. Leveraging this insight, we propose RLCracker, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based adaptive attack that erases watermarks while preserving semantic fidelity. RLCracker requires only limited watermarked examples and zero access to the detector. Despite weak supervision, it empowers a 3B model to achieve 98.5% removal success and an average 0.92 P-SP score on 1,500-token Unigram-marked texts after training on only 100 short samples. This performance dramatically exceeds 6.75% by GPT-4o and generalizes across five model sizes over ten watermarking schemes. Our results confirm that adaptive attacks are broadly effective and pose a fundamental threat to current watermarking defenses.

      For RL algorithms, appropriate entropy control is crucial to their effectiveness. To control the policy entropy, a commonly used method is entropy regularization, which is adopted in various popular RL algorithms including PPO, SAC and A3C. Although entropy regularization proves effective in robotic and games RL conventionally, studies found that it gives weak to no gains in LLM-RL training. In this work, we study the issues of entropy bonus in LLM-RL setting. Specifically, we first argue that the conventional entropy regularization suffers from the LLM's extremely large response space and the sparsity of the optimal outputs. As a remedy, we propose AEnt, an entropy control method that utilizes a new clamped entropy bonus with an automatically adjusted coefficient. The clamped entropy is evaluated with the re-normalized policy defined on certain smaller token space, which encourages exploration within a more compact response set. In addition, the algorithm automatically adjusts entropy coefficient according to the clamped entropy value, effectively controlling the entropy-induced bias while leveraging the entropy's benefits. AEnt is tested in math-reasoning tasks under different base models and datasets, and it is observed that AEnt outperforms the baselines consistently across multiple benchmarks.

Existing detection methods, which primarily rely on surface-level lexical overlap and perplexity, demonstrate low generalization and degrade significantly when encountering implicitly contaminated data. In this paper, we propose MemLens (An Activation Lens for Memorization Detection) to detect memorization by analyzing the probability trajectories of numeric tokens during generation. Our method reveals that contaminated samples exhibit ``shortcut'' behaviors, locking onto an answer with high confidence in the model's early layers, whereas clean samples show more gradual evidence accumulation across the model's full depth. We observe that contaminated and clean samples exhibit distinct and well-separated reasoning trajectories. To further validate this, we inject carefully designed samples into the model through LoRA fine-tuning and observe the same trajectory patterns as in naturally contaminated data. These results provide strong evidence that MemLens captures genuine signals of memorization rather than spurious correlations.

      Large language models for code generation increasingly rely on synthetic data, where both problem solutions and verification tests are generated by models. While this enables scalable data creation, it introduces a previously unexplored bottleneck: the verification ceiling, in which the quality and diversity of training data are fundamentally constrained by the capabilities of synthetic verifiers. In this work, we systematically study how verification design and strategies influence model performance. We investigate (i) what we verify by analyzing the impact of test complexity and quantity: richer test suites improve code generation capabilities (on average +3 pass@1), while quantity alone yields diminishing returns, (ii) how we verify by exploring relaxed pass thresholds: rigid 100% pass criteria can be overly restrictive. By allowing for relaxed thresholds or incorporating LLM-based soft verification, we can recover valuable training data, leading to a 2-4 point improvement in pass@1 performance. However, this benefit is contingent upon the strength and diversity of the test cases used, and (iii) why verification remains necessary through controlled comparisons of formally correct versus incorrect solutions and human evaluation: retaining diverse correct solutions per problem yields consistent generalization gains. Our results show that Verification as currently practiced is too rigid, filtering out valuable diversity. But it cannot be discarded, only recalibrated. By combining calibrated verification with diverse, challenging problem-solution pairs, we outline a path to break the verification ceiling and unlock stronger code generation models.

      Deployable service and delivery robots struggle to navigate multi-floor buildings to reach object goals, as existing systems fail due to single-floor assumptions and requirements for offline, globally consistent maps. Multi-floor environments pose unique challenges including cross-floor transitions and vertical spatial reasoning, especially navigating unknown buildings. Object-Goal Navigation benchmarks like HM3D and MP3D also capture this multi-floor reality, yet current methods lack support for online, floor-aware navigation. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{\textit{ASCENT}}, an online framework for Zero-Shot Object-Goal Navigation that enables robots to operate without pre-built maps or retraining on new object categories. It introduces: (1) a \textbf{Multi-Floor Abstraction} module that dynamically constructs hierarchical representations with stair-aware obstacle mapping and cross-floor topology modeling, and (2) a \textbf{Coarse-to-Fine Reasoning} module that combines frontier ranking with LLM-driven contextual analysis for multi-floor navigation decisions. We evaluate on HM3D and MP3D benchmarks, outperforming state-of-the-art zero-shot approaches, and demonstrate real-world deployment on a quadruped robot.

      Robust supervised fine-tuned small Language Models (sLMs) often show high reliability but tend to undercorrect. They achieve high precision at the cost of low recall. Conversely, Large Language Models (LLMs) often show the opposite tendency, making excessive overcorrection, leading to low precision. To effectively harness the strengths of LLMs to address the recall challenges in sLMs, we propose Post-Correction via Overcorrection (PoCO), a novel approach that strategically balances recall and precision. PoCO first intentionally triggers overcorrection via LLM to maximize recall by allowing comprehensive revisions, then applies a targeted post-correction step via fine-tuning smaller models to identify and refine erroneous outputs. We aim to harmonize both aspects by leveraging the generative power of LLMs while preserving the reliability of smaller supervised models. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that PoCO effectively balances GEC performance by increasing recall with competitive precision, ultimately improving the overall quality of grammatical error correction.
