    <details class="paper-abstract">
      The generation of data is a common approach to improve the performance of machine learning tasks, among which is the training of models for classification. In this paper, we present TAGAL, a collection of methods able to generate synthetic tabular data using an agentic workflow. The methods leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for an automatic and iterative process that uses feedback to improve the generated data without any further LLM training. The use of LLMs also allows for the addition of external knowledge in the generation process. We evaluate TAGAL across diverse datasets and different aspects of quality for the generated data. We look at the utility of downstream ML models, both by training classifiers on synthetic data only and by combining real and synthetic data. Moreover, we compare the similarities between the real and the generated data. We show that TAGAL is able to perform on par with state-of-the-art approaches that require LLM training and generally outperforms other training-free approaches. These findings highlight the potential of agentic workflow and open new directions for LLM-based data generation methods.

      This study explores an LLM's ability to learn new languages using explanations found in a grammar book, a process we term "explicit learning." To rigorously assess this ability, we design controlled translation experiments between English and constructed languages generated, through specific cryptographic means, from Latin or French. Contrary to previous studies, our results demonstrate that LLMs do possess a measurable capacity for explicit learning. This ability, however, diminishes as the complexity of the linguistic phenomena to be learned increases. Supervised fine-tuning on ad hoc chains of thought significantly enhances LLM performance but struggles to generalize to typologically novel or more complex linguistic features. These findings point to the need for more diverse training sets and alternative fine-tuning strategies to further improve explicit learning by LLMs, benefiting low-resource languages typically described in grammar books but lacking extensive corpora.

      Large language models (LLMs) achieve astonishing results on a wide range of tasks. However, their formal reasoning ability still lags behind. A promising approach is Neurosymbolic LLM reasoning. It works by using LLMs as translators from natural to formal languages and symbolic solvers for deriving correct results. Still, the contributing factors to the success of Neurosymbolic LLM reasoning remain unclear. This paper demonstrates that one previously overlooked factor is the choice of the formal language. We introduce the intermediate language challenge: selecting a suitable formal language for neurosymbolic reasoning. By comparing four formal languages across three datasets and seven LLMs, we show that the choice of formal language affects both syntactic and semantic reasoning capabilities. We also discuss the varying effects across different LLMs.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Despite advances in improving large language model (LLM) to refuse to answer malicious instructions, widely used LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks where attackers generate instructions with distributions differing from safety alignment corpora. New attacks expose LLMs' inability to recognize unseen malicious instructions, highlighting a critical distributional mismatch between training data and real-world attacks that forces developers into reactive patching cycles. To tackle this challenge, we propose IMAGINE, a synthesis framework that leverages embedding space distribution analysis to generate jailbreak-like instructions. This approach effectively fills the distributional gap between authentic jailbreak patterns and safety alignment corpora. IMAGINE follows an iterative optimization process that dynamically evolves text generation distributions across iterations, thereby augmenting the coverage of safety alignment data distributions through synthesized data examples. Based on the safety-aligned corpus enhanced through IMAGINE, our framework demonstrates significant decreases in attack success rate on Qwen2.5, Llama3.1, and Llama3.2 without compromising their utility.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Reducing the key-value (KV) cache burden in Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly accelerates inference. Dynamically selecting critical KV caches during decoding helps maintain performance. Existing methods use random linear hashing to identify important tokens, but this approach is inefficient due to the orthogonal distribution of queries and keys within two narrow cones in LLMs. We introduce Spotlight Attention, a novel method that employs non-linear hashing functions to optimize the embedding distribution of queries and keys, enhancing coding efficiency and robustness. We also developed a lightweight, stable training framework using a Bradley-Terry ranking-based loss, enabling optimization of the non-linear hashing module on GPUs with 16GB memory in 8 hours. Experimental results show that Spotlight Attention drastically improves retrieval precision while shortening the length of the hash code at least 5$\times$ compared to traditional linear hashing. Finally, we exploit the computational advantages of bitwise operations by implementing specialized CUDA kernels, achieving hashing retrieval for 512K tokens in under 100$\mu$s on a single A100 GPU, with end-to-end throughput up to 3$\times$ higher than vanilla decoding.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) effectiveness is usually evaluated by means of benchmarks such as MMLU, ARC-C, or HellaSwag, where questions are presented in their original wording, thus in a fixed, standardized format. However, real-world applications involve linguistic variability, requiring models to maintain their effectiveness across diverse rewordings of the same question or query. In this study, we systematically assess the robustness of LLMs to paraphrased benchmark questions and investigate whether benchmark-based evaluations provide a reliable measure of model capabilities. We systematically generate various paraphrases of all the questions across six different common benchmarks, and measure the resulting variations in effectiveness of 34 state-of-the-art LLMs, of different size and effectiveness. Our findings reveal that while LLM rankings remain relatively stable across paraphrased inputs, absolute effectiveness scores change, and decline significantly. This suggests that LLMs struggle with linguistic variability, raising concerns about their generalization abilities and evaluation methodologies. Furthermore, the observed performance drop challenges the reliability of benchmark-based evaluations, indicating that high benchmark scores may not fully capture a model's robustness to real-world input variations. We discuss the implications of these findings for LLM evaluation methodologies, emphasizing the need for robustness-aware benchmarks that better reflect practical deployment scenarios.

      Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (PBO) provides a powerful framework for modeling combinatorial problems through pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints. Local search solvers have shown excellent performance in PBO solving, and their efficiency is highly dependent on their internal heuristics to guide the search. Still, their design often requires significant expert effort and manual tuning in practice. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in automating algorithm design, their application to optimizing PBO solvers remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce AutoPBO, a novel LLM-powered framework to automatically enhance PBO local search solvers. We conduct experiments on a broad range of four public benchmarks, including one real-world benchmark, a benchmark from PB competition, an integer linear programming optimization benchmark, and a crafted combinatorial benchmark, to evaluate the performance improvement achieved by AutoPBO and compare it with six state-of-the-art competitors, including two local search PBO solvers NuPBO and OraSLS, two complete PB solvers PBO-IHS and RoundingSat, and two mixed integer programming (MIP) solvers Gurobi and SCIP. AutoPBO demonstrates significant improvements over previous local search approaches, while maintaining competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art competitors. The results suggest that AutoPBO offers a promising approach to automating local search solver design.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Large language model (LLM) agents achieve impressive single-task performance but commonly exhibit repeated failures, inefficient exploration, and limited cross-task adaptability. Existing reflective strategies (e.g., Reflexion, ReAct) improve per-episode behavior but typically produce ephemeral, task-specific traces that are not reused across tasks. Reinforcement-learning based alternatives can produce transferable policies but require substantial parameter updates and compute. In this work we introduce Meta-Policy Reflexion (MPR): a hybrid framework that consolidates LLM-generated reflections into a structured, predicate-like Meta-Policy Memory (MPM) and applies that memory at inference time through two complementary mechanisms soft memory-guided decoding and hard rule admissibility checks(HAC). MPR (i) externalizes reusable corrective knowledge without model weight updates, (ii) enforces domain constraints to reduce unsafe or invalid actions, and (iii) retains the adaptability of language-based reflection. We formalize the MPM representation, present algorithms for update and decoding, and validate the approach in a text-based agent environment following the experimental protocol described in the provided implementation (AlfWorld-based). Empirical results reported in the supplied material indicate consistent gains in execution accuracy and robustness when compared to Reflexion baselines; rule admissibility further improves stability. We analyze mechanisms that explain these gains, discuss scalability and failure modes, and outline future directions for multimodal and multi?agent extensions.

      Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been explored as powerful text embedders. Existing LLM-based text embedding approaches often leverage the embedding of the final token, typically a reserved special token such as [EOS]. However, these tokens have not been intentionally trained to capture the semantics of the whole context, limiting their capacity as text embeddings, especially for retrieval and re-ranking tasks. We propose to add a new training stage before contrastive learning to enrich the semantics of the final token embedding. This stage employs bidirectional generative reconstruction tasks, namely EBQ2D (Embedding-Based Query-to-Document) and EBD2Q (Embedding-Based Document-to-Query), which interleave to anchor the [EOS] embedding and reconstruct either side of Query-Document pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that our additional training stage significantly improves LLM performance on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), achieving new state-of-the-art results across different LLM base models and scales.

      Generative speech models have demonstrated significant potential in improving human-machine interactions, offering valuable real-world applications such as language learning for children. However, achieving high-quality, child-friendly speech generation remains challenging, particularly for low-resource languages across diverse languages and cultural contexts. In this paper, we propose MultiGen, a multilingual speech generation model with child-friendly interaction, leveraging LLM architecture for speech generation tailored for low-resource languages. We propose to integrate age-appropriate multilingual speech generation using LLM architectures, which can be used to facilitate young children's communication with AI systems through culturally relevant context in three low-resource languages: Singaporean accent Mandarin, Malay, and Tamil. Experimental results from both objective metrics and subjective evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed MultiGen compared to baseline methods.

      The effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) to fact-check misinformation remains uncertain, despite their growing use. To this end, we present CANDY, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in fact-checking Chinese misinformation. Specifically, we curate a carefully annotated dataset of ~20k instances. Our analysis shows that current LLMs exhibit limitations in generating accurate fact-checking conclusions, even when enhanced with chain-of-thought reasoning and few-shot prompting. To understand these limitations, we develop a taxonomy to categorize flawed LLM-generated explanations for their conclusions and identify factual fabrication as the most common failure mode. Although LLMs alone are unreliable for fact-checking, our findings indicate their considerable potential to augment human performance when deployed as assistive tools in scenarios.

      Debugging and repairing faults when programs fail to formally verify can be complex and time-consuming. Automated Program Repair (APR) can ease this burden by automatically identifying and fixing faults. However, traditional APR techniques often rely on test suites for validation, but these may not capture all possible scenarios. In contrast, formal specifications provide strong correctness criteria, enabling more effective automated repair. In this paper, we present an APR tool for Dafny, a verification-aware programming language that uses formal specifications - including pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants - as oracles for fault localization and repair. Assuming the correctness of the specifications and focusing on arithmetic bugs, we localize faults through a series of steps, which include using Hoare logic to determine the state of each statement within the program, and applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize candidate fixes. The models considered are GPT-4o mini, Llama 3, Mistral 7B, and Llemma 7B. We evaluate our approach using DafnyBench, a benchmark of real-world Dafny programs. Our tool achieves 89.6% fault localization coverage and GPT-4o mini yields the highest repair success rate of 74.18%. These results highlight the potential of combining formal reasoning with LLM-based program synthesis for automated program repair.

      The emergence of agentic AI, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), marks a paradigm shift from reactive generative systems to proactive, goal-oriented autonomous agents capable of sophisticated planning, memory, and tool use. This evolution presents a novel opportunity to address long-standing challenges in complex digital environments. Core tasks on Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C) e-commerce platforms often require users to navigate complex Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), making the experience time-consuming for both buyers and sellers. This paper introduces a novel approach to simplify these interactions through an LLM-powered agentic assistant. This agent functions as a new, conversational entry point to the marketplace, shifting the primary interaction model from a complex GUI to an intuitive AI agent. By interpreting natural language commands, the agent automates key high-friction workflows. For sellers, this includes simplified updating and renewal of listings, and the ability to send bulk messages. For buyers, the agent facilitates a more efficient product discovery process through conversational search. We present the architecture for Facebook Marketplace Assistant (FaMA), arguing that this agentic, conversational paradigm provides a lightweight and more accessible alternative to traditional app interfaces, allowing users to manage their marketplace activities with greater efficiency. Experiments show FaMA achieves a 98% task success rate on solving complex tasks on the marketplace and enables up to a 2x speedup on interaction time.

      We introduce Drivelology, a unique linguistic phenomenon characterised as "nonsense with depth", utterances that are syntactically coherent yet pragmatically paradoxical, emotionally loaded, or rhetorically subversive. While such expressions may resemble surface-level nonsense, they encode implicit meaning requiring contextual inference, moral reasoning, or emotional interpretation. We find that current large language models (LLMs), despite excelling at many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, consistently fail to grasp the layered semantics of Drivelological text. To investigate this, we construct a small but diverse benchmark dataset of over 1,200 meticulously curated examples, with select instances in English, Mandarin, Spanish, French, Japanese, and Korean. Annotation was especially challenging: each of the examples required careful expert review to verify that it truly reflected Drivelological characteristics. The process involved multiple rounds of discussion and adjudication to address disagreements, highlighting the subtle and subjective nature of the Drivelology. We evaluate a range of LLMs on classification, generation, and reasoning tasks. Our results reveal clear limitations of LLMs: models often confuse Drivelology with shallow nonsense, produce incoherent justifications, or miss the implied rhetorical function altogether. These findings highlight a deeper representational gap in LLMs' pragmatic understanding and challenge the assumption that statistical fluency implies cognitive comprehension. We release our dataset and code to facilitate further research in modelling linguistic depth beyond surface-level coherence.

      Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted in high-stakes domains. Their capacity to process vast amounts of unstructured data, explore flexible scenarios, and handle a diversity of contextual factors can make them uniquely suited to provide new insights for the complexity of social policymaking. This article evaluates whether LLMs' are aligned with domain experts (and among themselves) to inform social policymaking on the subject of homelessness alleviation - a challenge affecting over 150 million people worldwide. We develop a novel benchmark comprised of decision scenarios with policy choices across four geographies (South Bend, USA; Barcelona, Spain; Johannesburg, South Africa; Macau SAR, China). The policies in scope are grounded in the conceptual framework of the Capability Approach for human development. We also present an automated pipeline that connects the benchmarked policies to an agent-based model, and we explore the social impact of the recommended policies through simulated social scenarios. The paper results reveal promising potential to leverage LLMs for social policy making. If responsible guardrails and contextual calibrations are introduced in collaboration with local domain experts, LLMs can provide humans with valuable insights, in the form of alternative policies at scale.

      The use of large language models (LLMs) as judges, particularly in preference comparisons, has become widespread, but this reveals a notable bias towards longer responses, undermining the reliability of such evaluations. To better understand such bias, we propose to decompose the preference evaluation metric, specifically the win rate, into two key components: desirability and information mass, where the former is length-independent and related to trustworthiness such as correctness, toxicity, and consistency, and the latter is length-dependent and represents the amount of information in the response. We empirically demonstrated the decomposition through controlled experiments and found that response length impacts evaluations by influencing information mass. To derive a reliable evaluation metric that assesses content quality without being confounded by response length, we propose AdapAlpaca, a simple yet effective adjustment to win rate measurement. Specifically, AdapAlpaca ensures a fair comparison of response quality by aligning the lengths of reference and test model responses under equivalent length intervals.

      Multi-agent systems of large language models (LLMs) show promise for complex reasoning, but their effectiveness is often limited by fixed collaboration protocols. These frameworks typically focus on macro-level orchestration while overlooking agents' internal deliberative capabilities. This critical meta-cognitive blindspot treats agents as passive executors unable to adapt their strategy based on internal cognitive states like uncertainty or confidence. We introduce the Meta-Policy Deliberation Framework (MPDF), where agents learn a decentralized policy over a set of high-level meta-cognitive actions: Persist, Refine, and Concede. To overcome the instability of traditional policy gradients in this setting, we develop SoftRankPO, a novel reinforcement learning algorithm. SoftRankPO stabilizes training by shaping advantages based on the rank of rewards mapped through smooth normal quantiles, making the learning process robust to reward variance. Experiments show that MPDF with SoftRankPO achieves a a 4-5% absolute gain in average accuracy across five mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks compared to six state-of-the-art heuristic and learning-based multi-agent reasoning algorithms. Our work presents a paradigm for learning adaptive, meta-cognitive policies for multi-agent LLM systems, shifting the focus from designing fixed protocols to learning dynamic, deliberative strategies.

      Scientific research is inherently global. However, the vast majority of academic journals are published exclusively in English, creating barriers for non-native-English-speaking researchers. In this study, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to translate published scientific articles while preserving their native JATS XML formatting, thereby developing a practical, automated approach for implementation by academic journals. Using our approach, we translate articles across multiple scientific disciplines into 28 languages. To evaluate translation accuracy, we introduce a novel question-and-answer (QA) benchmarking method, in which an LLM generates comprehension-based questions from the original text and then answers them based on the translated text. Our benchmark results show an average performance of 95.9%, showing that the key scientific details are accurately conveyed. In a user study, we translate the scientific papers of 15 researchers into their native languages, finding that the authors consistently found the translations to accurately capture the original information in their articles. Interestingly, a third of the authors found many technical terms "overtranslated," expressing a preference to keep terminology more familiar in English untranslated. Finally, we demonstrate how in-context learning techniques can be used to align translations with domain-specific preferences such as mitigating overtranslation, highlighting the adaptability and utility of LLM-driven scientific translation.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Publishing a large language model (LLM) benchmark on the Internet risks contaminating future LLMs: the benchmark may be unintentionally (or intentionally) used to train or select a model. A common mitigation is to keep the benchmark private and let participants submit their models or predictions to the organizers. However, this strategy will require trust in a single organization and still permits test-set overfitting through repeated queries. To overcome this issue, we propose a way to publish benchmarks without completely disclosing the ground-truth answers to the questions, while still maintaining the ability to openly evaluate LLMs. Our main idea is to inject randomness to the answers by preparing several logically correct answers, and only include one of them as the solution in the benchmark. This reduces the best possible accuracy, i.e., Bayes accuracy, of the benchmark. Not only is this helpful to keep us from disclosing the ground truth, but this approach also offers a test for detecting data contamination. In principle, even fully capable models should not surpass the Bayes accuracy. If a model surpasses this ceiling despite this expectation, this is a strong signal of data contamination. We present experimental evidence that our method can detect data contamination accurately on a wide range of benchmarks, models, and training methodologies.

      Large language models (LLMs) leverage deep learning architectures to process and predict sequences of words, enabling them to perform a wide range of natural language processing tasks, such as translation, summarization, question answering, and content generation. As existing LLMs are often built from base models or other pre-trained models and use external datasets, they can inevitably inherit vulnerabilities, biases, or malicious components that exist in previous models or datasets. Therefore, it is critical to understand these components' origin and development process to detect potential risks, improve model fairness, and ensure compliance with regulatory frameworks. Motivated by that, this project aims to study such relationships between models and datasets, which are the central parts of the LLM supply chain. First, we design a methodology to systematically collect LLMs' supply chain information. Then, we design a new graph to model the relationships between models and datasets, which is a directed heterogeneous graph, having 402,654 nodes and 462,524 edges. Lastly, we perform different types of analysis and make multiple interesting findings.

      Knowledge graphs (KGs) are foundational to many AI applications, but maintaining their freshness and completeness remains costly. We present ODKE+, a production-grade system that automatically extracts and ingests millions of open-domain facts from web sources with high precision. ODKE+ combines modular components into a scalable pipeline: (1) the Extraction Initiator detects missing or stale facts, (2) the Evidence Retriever collects supporting documents, (3) hybrid Knowledge Extractors apply both pattern-based rules and ontology-guided prompting for large language models (LLMs), (4) a lightweight Grounder validates extracted facts using a second LLM, and (5) the Corroborator ranks and normalizes candidate facts for ingestion. ODKE+ dynamically generates ontology snippets tailored to each entity type to align extractions with schema constraints, enabling scalable, type-consistent fact extraction across 195 predicates. The system supports batch and streaming modes, processing over 9 million Wikipedia pages and ingesting 19 million high-confidence facts with 98.8% precision. ODKE+ significantly improves coverage over traditional methods, achieving up to 48% overlap with third-party KGs and reducing update lag by 50 days on average. Our deployment demonstrates that LLM-based extraction, grounded in ontological structure and verification workflows, can deliver trustworthiness, production-scale knowledge ingestion with broad real-world applicability.

      Recently, extensive research on the hallucination of the large language models (LLMs) has mainly focused on the English language. Despite the growing number of multilingual and Arabic-specific LLMs, evaluating LLMs' hallucination in the Arabic context remains relatively underexplored. The knowledge gap is particularly pressing given Arabic's widespread use across many regions and its importance in global communication and media. This paper presents the first comprehensive hallucination evaluation of Arabic and multilingual LLMs on two critical Arabic natural language generation tasks: generative question answering (GQA) and summarization. This study evaluates a total of 12 LLMs, including 4 Arabic pre-trained models, 4 multilingual models, and 4 reasoning-based models. To assess the factual consistency and faithfulness of LLMs' outputs, we developed a fine-grained hallucination evaluation framework consisting of 12 fine-grained hallucination indicators that represent the varying characteristics of each task. The results reveal that factual hallucinations are more prevalent than faithfulness errors across all models and tasks. Notably, the Arabic pre-trained model Allam consistently demonstrates lower hallucination rates than multilingual models and a comparative performance with reasoning-based models.

      We propose a novel inference-time out-of-domain (OOD) detection algorithm for specialized large language models (LLMs). Despite achieving state-of-the-art performance on in-domain tasks through fine-tuning, specialized LLMs remain vulnerable to incorrect or unreliable outputs when presented with OOD inputs, posing risks in critical applications. Our method leverages the Inductive Conformal Anomaly Detection (ICAD) framework, using a new non-conformity measure based on the model's dropout tolerance. Motivated by recent findings on polysemanticity and redundancy in LLMs, we hypothesize that in-domain inputs exhibit higher dropout tolerance than OOD inputs. We aggregate dropout tolerance across multiple layers via a valid ensemble approach, improving detection while maintaining theoretical false alarm bounds from ICAD. Experiments with medical-specialized LLMs show that our approach detects OOD inputs better than baseline methods, with AUROC improvements of $2\%$ to $37\%$ when treating OOD datapoints as positives and in-domain test datapoints as negatives.

      As the complexity of artificial agents increases, the design of environments that can effectively shape their behavior and capabilities has become a critical research frontier. We propose a framework that extends this principle to a novel class of agents: biological neural networks in the form of neural organoids. This paper introduces three scalable, closed-loop virtual environments designed to train organoid-based biological agents and probe the underlying mechanisms of learning, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). We detail the design of three distinct task environments with increasing complexity: (1) a conditional avoidance task, (2) a one-dimensional predator-prey scenario, and (3) a replication of the classic Pong game. For each environment, we formalize the state and action spaces, the sensory encoding and motor decoding mechanisms, and the feedback protocols based on predictable (reward) and unpredictable (punishment) stimulation. Furthermore, we propose a novel meta-learning approach where a Large Language Model (LLM) is used to automate the generation and optimization of experimental protocols, scaling the process of environment and curriculum design. Finally, we outline a multi-modal approach for evaluating learning by measuring synaptic plasticity at electrophysiological, cellular, and molecular levels. This work bridges the gap between computational neuroscience and agent-based AI, offering a unique platform for studying embodiment, learning, and intelligence in a controlled biological substrate.

      Recent math benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) such as MathArena indicate that state-of-the-art reasoning models achieve impressive performance on mathematical competitions like AIME, with the leading model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieving scores comparable to top human competitors. However, these benchmarks evaluate models solely based on final numerical answers, neglecting rigorous reasoning and proof generation which are essential for real-world mathematical tasks. To address this, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation of full-solution reasoning for challenging mathematical problems. Using expert human annotators, we evaluated several state-of-the-art reasoning models on the six problems from the 2025 USAMO within hours of their release. Our results reveal that all tested models struggled significantly: only Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves a non-trivial score of 25%, while all other models achieve less than 5%. Through detailed analysis of reasoning traces, we identify the most common failure modes and find several unwanted artifacts arising from the optimization strategies employed during model training. Overall, our results suggest that current LLMs are inadequate for rigorous mathematical reasoning tasks, highlighting the need for substantial improvements in reasoning and proof generation capabilities.

      The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced critical security challenges, where adversarial actors can manipulate input prompts to cause significant harm and circumvent safety alignments. These prompt-based attacks exploit vulnerabilities in a model's design, training, and contextual understanding, leading to intellectual property theft, misinformation generation, and erosion of user trust. A systematic understanding of these attack vectors is the foundational step toward developing robust countermeasures. This paper presents a comprehensive literature survey of prompt-based attack methodologies, categorizing them to provide a clear threat model.

      Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled natural language interfaces that translate user questions into database queries, such as Text2SQL, Text2SPARQL, and Text2Cypher. While these interfaces enhance database accessibility, most research today focuses on English, with limited evaluation in other languages. This paper investigates the performance of both foundational and finetuned LLMs on the Text2Cypher task across multiple languages. We create and release a multilingual dataset by translating English questions into Spanish and Turkish while preserving the original Cypher queries, enabling fair cross-lingual comparison. Using standardized prompts and metrics, we evaluate several foundational models and observe a consistent performance pattern: highest on English, followed by Spanish, and lowest on Turkish. We attribute this to differences in training data availability and linguistic features. We also examine the impact of translating task prompts into Spanish and Turkish. Results show little to no change in evaluation metrics, suggesting prompt translation has minor impact. Furthermore, we finetune a foundational model on two datasets: one in English only, and one multilingual. Finetuning on English improves overall accuracy but widens the performance gap between languages. In contrast, multilingual finetuning narrows the gap, resulting in more balanced performance. Our findings highlight the importance for multilingual evaluation and training to build more inclusive and robust query generation systems.

      We investigate the emergent social dynamics of Large Language Model (LLM) agents in a spatially extended El Farol Bar problem, observing how they autonomously navigate this classic social dilemma. As a result, the LLM agents generated a spontaneous motivation to go to the bar and changed their decision making by becoming a collective. We also observed that the LLM agents did not solve the problem completely, but rather behaved more like humans. These findings reveal a complex interplay between external incentives (prompt-specified constraints such as the 60\% threshold) and internal incentives (culturally-encoded social preferences derived from pre-training), demonstrating that LLM agents naturally balance formal game-theoretic rationality with social motivations that characterize human behavior. These findings suggest that a new model of group decision making, which could not be handled in the previous game-theoretic problem setting, can be realized by LLM agents.

      Large language models (LLMs) have undergone safety alignment efforts to mitigate harmful outputs. However, as LLMs become more sophisticated in reasoning, their intelligence may introduce new security risks. While traditional jailbreak attacks relied on singlestep attacks, multi-turn jailbreak strategies that adapt dynamically to context remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce TRIAL (Trolley-problem Reasoning for Interactive Attack Logic), a framework that leverages LLMs ethical reasoning to bypass their safeguards. TRIAL embeds adversarial goals within ethical dilemmas modeled on the trolley problem. TRIAL demonstrates high jailbreak success rates towards both open and close-source models. Our findings underscore a fundamental limitation in AI safety: as models gain advanced reasoning abilities, the nature of their alignment may inadvertently allow for more covert security vulnerabilities to be exploited. TRIAL raises an urgent need in reevaluating safety alignment oversight strategies, as current safeguards may prove insufficient against context-aware adversarial attack.

      This paper investigates the propagation of harmful information in multilingual large language models (LLMs) and evaluates the efficacy of various unlearning methods. We demonstrate that fake information, regardless of the language it is in, once introduced into these models through training data, can spread across different languages, compromising the integrity and reliability of the generated content. Our findings reveal that standard unlearning techniques, which typically focus on English data, are insufficient in mitigating the spread of harmful content in multilingual contexts and could inadvertently reinforce harmful content across languages. We show that only by addressing harmful responses in both English and the original language of the harmful data can we effectively eliminate generations for all languages. This underscores the critical need for comprehensive unlearning strategies that consider the multilingual nature of modern LLMs to enhance their safety and reliability across diverse linguistic landscapes.

      This full paper describes an LLM-assisted instruction integrated with a virtual cybersecurity lab platform. The digital transformation of Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) systems is reshaping workforce needs, widening skill gaps, especially among older workers. With rising emphasis on robotics, automation, AI, and security, re-skilling and up-skilling are essential. Generative AI can help build this workforce by acting as an instructional assistant to support skill acquisition during experiential learning. We present a generative AI instructional assistant integrated into a prior experiential learning platform. The assistant employs a zero-shot OCR-LLM pipeline within the legacy Cybersecurity Labs-as-a-Service (CLaaS) platform (2015). Text is extracted from slide images using Tesseract OCR, then simplified instructions are generated via a general-purpose LLM, enabling real-time instructional support with minimal infrastructure. The system was evaluated in a live university course where student feedback (n=42) averaged 7.83/10, indicating strong perceived usefulness. A comparative study with multimodal LLMs that directly interpret slide images showed higher performance on visually dense slides, but the OCR-LLM pipeline provided comparable pedagogical value on text-centric slides with much lower computational overhead and cost. This work demonstrates that a lightweight, easily integrable pipeline can effectively extend legacy platforms with modern generative AI, offering scalable enhancements for student comprehension in technical education.

      Early detection of cognitive decline is crucial for enabling interventions that can slow neurodegenerative disease progression. Traditional diagnostic approaches rely on labor-intensive clinical assessments, which are impractical for frequent monitoring. Our pilot study investigates voice assistant systems (VAS) as non-invasive tools for detecting cognitive decline through longitudinal analysis of speech patterns in voice commands. Over an 18-month period, we collected voice commands from 35 older adults, with 15 participants providing daily at-home VAS interactions. To address the challenges of analyzing these short, unstructured and noisy commands, we propose Cog-TiPRO, a framework that combines (1) LLM-driven iterative prompt refinement for linguistic feature extraction, (2) HuBERT-based acoustic feature extraction, and (3) transformer-based temporal modeling. Using iTransformer, our approach achieves 73.80% accuracy and 72.67% F1-score in detecting MCI, outperforming its baseline by 27.13%. Through our LLM approach, we identify linguistic features that uniquely characterize everyday command usage patterns in individuals experiencing cognitive decline.

      Large language models (LLMs) now support extremely long context windows, but the quadratic complexity of vanilla attention results in significantly long Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) latency. Existing approaches to address this complexity require additional pretraining or finetuning, and often sacrifice model accuracy. In this paper, we first provide both theoretical and empirical foundations for near-lossless sparse attention. We find dynamically capturing head-specific sparse patterns at runtime with low overhead is crucial. To address this, we propose SampleAttention, an adaptive structured and near-lossless sparse attention. Leveraging observed significant sparse patterns, SampleAttention attends to a fixed percentage of adjacent tokens to capture local window patterns, and employs a two-stage query-guided key-value filtering approach, which adaptively select a minimum set of key-values with low overhead, to capture column stripe patterns. Comprehensive evaluations show that SampleAttention can seamlessly replace vanilla attention in off-the-shelf LLMs with nearly no accuracy loss, and reduces TTFT by up to $2.42\times$ compared with FlashAttention.

      Large language models (LLMs) increasingly act on people's behalf: they write emails, buy groceries, and book restaurants. While the outsourcing of human decision-making to AI can be both efficient and effective, it raises a fundamental question: how does delegating identity-defining choices to AI reshape who people become? We study the impact of agentic LLMs on two identity-relevant outcomes: interpersonal distinctiveness - how unique a person's choices are relative to others - and intrapersonal diversity - the breadth of a single person's choices over time. Using real choices drawn from social-media behavior of 1,000 U.S. users (110,000 choices in total), we compare a generic and personalized agent to a human baseline. Both agents shift people's choices toward more popular options, reducing the distinctiveness of their behaviors and preferences. While the use of personalized agents tempers this homogenization (compared to the generic AI), it also more strongly compresses the diversity of people's preference portfolios by narrowing what they explore across topics and psychological affinities. Understanding how AI agents might flatten human experience, and how using generic versus personalized agents involves distinctiveness-diversity trade-offs, is critical for designing systems that augment rather than constrain human agency, and for safeguarding diversity in thought, taste, and expression.

We further develop a SafetyClamp extension that fetches a larger candidate pool, "hard-clamping" exact slot guarantees to safety. We evaluate across sparse (BM25), dense (Dense Passage Retrieval) and hybrid retrieval paradigms, measuring Technical Recall@K and Safety Recall@K.

      Integrating product catalogs and user behavior into LLMs can enhance recommendations with broad world knowledge, but the scale of real-world item catalogs, often containing millions of discrete item identifiers (Item IDs), poses a significant challenge. This contrasts with the smaller, tokenized text vocabularies typically used in LLMs. The predominant view within the LLM-based recommendation literature is that it is infeasible to treat item ids as a first class citizen in the LLM and instead some sort of tokenization of an item into multiple tokens is required. However, this creates a key practical bottleneck in serving these models for real-time low-latency applications. Our paper challenges this predominant practice and integrates item ids as first class citizens into the LLM. We provide simple, yet highly effective, novel training and inference modifications that enable single-token representations of items and single-step decoding. Our method shows improvements in recommendation quality (Recall and NDCG) over existing techniques on the Amazon shopping datasets while significantly improving inference efficiency by 5x-14x. Our work offers an efficiency perspective distinct from that of other popular approaches within LLM-based recommendation, potentially inspiring further research and opening up a new direction for integrating IDs into LLMs. Our code is available here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cUMj37rV0Z1bCWMdhQ6i4q4eTRQLURtC

      The impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have fueled the notion that synthetic agents can serve as substitutes for real participants in human-subject research. In an effort to evaluate the merits of this claim, social science researchers have largely focused on whether LLM-generated survey data corresponds to that of a human counterpart whom the LLM is prompted to represent. In contrast, we address a more fundamental question: Do agents maintain internal consistency, retaining similar behaviors when examined under different experimental settings? To this end, we develop a study designed to (a) reveal the agent's internal state and (b) examine agent behavior in a basic dialogue setting. This design enables us to explore a set of behavioral hypotheses to assess whether an agent's conversation behavior is consistent with what we would expect from their revealed internal state. Our findings on these hypotheses show significant internal inconsistencies in LLMs across model families and at differing model sizes. Most importantly, we find that, although agents may generate responses matching those of their human counterparts, they fail to be internally consistent, representing a critical gap in their capabilities to accurately substitute for real participants in human-subject research. Our simulation code and data are publicly accessible.

      Static analysis is a powerful technique for bug detection in critical systems like operating system kernels. However, designing and implementing static analyzers is challenging, time-consuming, and typically limited to predefined bug patterns. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for static analysis, directly applying them to scan large systems remains impractical due to computational constraints and contextual limitations. We present KNighter, the first approach that unlocks scalable LLM-based static analysis by automatically synthesizing static analyzers from historical bug patterns. Rather than using LLMs to directly analyze massive systems, our key insight is leveraging LLMs to generate specialized static analyzers guided by historical patch knowledge. KNighter implements this vision through a multi-stage synthesis pipeline that validates checker correctness against original patches and employs an automated refinement process to iteratively reduce false positives. Our evaluation on the Linux kernel demonstrates that KNighter generates high-precision checkers capable of detecting diverse bug patterns overlooked by existing human-written analyzers. To date, KNighter-synthesized checkers have discovered 92 new, critical, long-latent bugs (average 4.3 years) in the Linux kernel; 77 are confirmed, 57 fixed, and 30 have been assigned CVE numbers. This work establishes an entirely new paradigm for scalable, reliable, and traceable LLM-based static analysis for real-world systems via checker synthesis.

Understanding these patterns is crucial, yet prior work primarily relied on simplified self-reports and heuristic prompting, with little behavioral validation. In this study, we systematically characterize LLM personality across three dimensions: (1) the dynamic emergence and evolution of trait profiles throughout training stages; (2) the predictive validity of self-reported traits in behavioral tasks; and (3) the impact of targeted interventions, such as persona injection, on both self-reports and behavior. Our findings reveal that instructional alignment (e.g., RLHF, instruction tuning) significantly stabilizes trait expression and strengthens trait correlations in ways that mirror human data. However, these self-reported traits do not reliably predict behavior, and observed associations often diverge from human patterns. While persona injection successfully steers self-reports in the intended direction, it exerts little or inconsistent effect on actual behavior. By distinguishing surface-level trait expression from behavioral consistency, our findings challenge assumptions about LLM personality and underscore the need for deeper evaluation in alignment and interpretability.

      Large language model (LLM) serving demands low latency and high throughput, but high load variability makes it challenging to achieve high GPU utilization. In this paper, we identify a synergetic but overlooked opportunity to co-serve latency-critical online requests alongside latency-tolerant offline tasks such as model benchmarking. While promising, existing serving systems fail to co-serve them efficiently, as their coarse-grained resource management at the request or iteration level cannot harvest millisecond-level GPU idle cycles without introducing interference that violates online latency objectives. ConServe is a new LLM co-serving system that achieves high throughput and strong online latency guarantees by managing resources at finer granularities. ConServe introduces three techniques: (1) a latency-aware token-level scheduler that precisely sizes offline batches and tokens to fit within online latency objectives; (2) sub-iteration, layer-wise preemption that allows offline tasks to yield to online load spikes; and (3) incremental KV cache management that enables preempting and resuming offline requests at near-zero cost. Evaluations with Llama-3.1 and Qwen-2.5 models on real-world workloads show that ConServe delivers an average of 2.2$\times$ higher throughput and reduces online serving tail latency by 2.9$\times$ on average compared to state-of-the-art systems.

      High-Performance Computing (HPC) job scheduling involves balancing conflicting objectives such as minimizing makespan, reducing wait times, optimizing resource use, and ensuring fairness. Traditional methods, including heuristic-based, e.g., First-Come-First-Served (FJFS) and Shortest Job First (SJF), or intensive optimization techniques, often lack adaptability to dynamic workloads and, more importantly, cannot simultaneously optimize multiple objectives in HPC systems. To address this, we propose a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based scheduler using a ReAct-style framework (Reason + Act), enabling iterative, interpretable decision-making. The system incorporates a scratchpad memory to track scheduling history and refine decisions via natural language feedback, while a constraint enforcement module ensures feasibility and safety. We evaluate our approach using OpenAI's O4-Mini and Anthropic's Claude 3.7 across seven real-world HPC workload scenarios, including heterogeneous mixes, bursty patterns, and adversarial cases etc. Comparisons against FCFS, SJF, and Google OR-Tools (on 10 to 100 jobs) reveal that LLM-based scheduling effectively balances multiple objectives while offering transparent reasoning through natural language traces. The method excels in constraint satisfaction and adapts to diverse workloads without domain-specific training. However, a trade-off between reasoning quality and computational overhead challenges real-time deployment. This work presents the first comprehensive study of reasoning-capable LLMs for HPC scheduling, demonstrating their potential to handle multiobjective optimization while highlighting limitations in computational efficiency. The findings provide insights into leveraging advanced language models for complex scheduling problems in dynamic HPC environments.

      Recommender and search systems commonly rely on Learning To Rank models trained on logged user interactions to order items by predicted relevance. However, such interaction data is often subject to position bias, as users are more likely to click on items that appear higher in the ranking, regardless of their actual relevance. As a result, newly trained models may inherit and reinforce the biases of prior ranking models rather than genuinely improving relevance. A standard approach to mitigate position bias is Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS), where the model's loss is weighted by the inverse of a propensity function, an estimate of the probability that an item at a given position is examined. However, accurate propensity estimation is challenging, especially in interfaces with complex non-linear layouts. In this paper, we propose a novel method for estimating position bias using Large Language Models (LLMs) applied to logged user interaction data. This approach offers a cost-effective alternative to online experimentation. Our experiments show that propensities estimated with our LLM-as-a-judge approach are stable across score buckets and reveal the row-column effects of Viator's grid layout that simpler heuristics overlook. An IPS-weighted reranker trained with these propensities matches the production model on standard NDCG@10 while improving weighted NDCG@10 by roughly 2%. We will verify these offline gains in forthcoming live-traffic experiments.

      Feedback is one of the most crucial components to facilitate effective learning. With the rise of large language models (LLMs) in recent years, research in programming education has increasingly focused on automated feedback generation to help teachers provide timely support to every student. However, prior studies often overlook key pedagogical principles, such as mastery and progress adaptation, that shape effective feedback strategies. This paper introduces a novel pedagogical framework for LLM-driven feedback generation derived from established feedback models and local insights from secondary school teachers. To evaluate this framework, we implemented a web-based application for Python programming with LLM-based feedback that follows the framework and conducted a mixed-method evaluation with eight secondary-school computer science teachers. Our findings suggest that teachers consider that, when aligned with the framework, LLMs can effectively support students and even outperform human teachers in certain scenarios through instant and precise feedback. However, we also found several limitations, such as its inability to adapt feedback to dynamic classroom contexts. Such a limitation highlights the need to complement LLM-generated feedback with human expertise to ensure effective student learning. This work demonstrates an effective way to use LLMs for feedback while adhering to pedagogical standards and highlights important considerations for future systems.

      Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as human-like decision-making agents in social science and applied settings. These LLM-agents are typically assigned human-like characters and placed in real-life contexts. However, how these characters and contexts shape an LLM's behavior remains underexplored. This study proposes and tests methods for probing, quantifying, and modifying an LLM's internal representations in a Dictator Game -- a classic behavioral experiment on fairness and prosocial behavior. We extract ``vectors of variable variations'' (e.g., ``male'' to ``female'') from the LLM's internal state. Manipulating these vectors during the model's inference can substantially alter how those variables relate to the model's decision-making. This approach offers a principled way to study and regulate how social concepts can be encoded and engineered within transformer-based models, with implications for alignment, debiasing, and designing AI agents for social simulations in both academic and commercial applications, strengthening sociological theory and measurement.

      Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as automated evaluators, yet they suffer from "self-preference bias": a tendency to favor their own outputs over those of other models. This bias undermines fairness and reliability in evaluation pipelines, particularly for tasks like preference tuning and model routing. We investigate whether lightweight steering vectors can mitigate this problem at inference time without retraining. We introduce a curated dataset that distinguishes self-preference bias into justified examples of self-preference and unjustified examples of self-preference, and we construct steering vectors using two methods: Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) and an optimization-based approach. Our results show that steering vectors can reduce unjustified self-preference bias by up to 97\%, substantially outperforming prompting and direct preference optimization baselines. Yet steering vectors are unstable on legitimate self-preference and unbiased agreement, implying self-preference spans multiple or nonlinear directions. This underscores both their promise and limits as safeguards for LLM-as-judges and motivates more robust interventions.

      Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven highly effective at enhancing the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet underlying mechanisms driving this success remain largely opaque. Our analysis reveals that puzzling phenomena like ``aha moments", ``length-scaling'' and entropy dynamics are not disparate occurrences but hallmarks of an emergent reasoning hierarchy, akin to the separation of high-level strategic planning from low-level procedural execution in human cognition. We uncover a compelling two-phase dynamic: initially, a model is constrained by procedural correctness and must improve its low-level skills. The learning bottleneck then decisively shifts, with performance gains being driven by the exploration and mastery of high-level strategic planning. This insight exposes a core inefficiency in prevailing RL algorithms like GRPO, which apply optimization pressure agnostically and dilute the learning signal across all tokens. To address this, we propose HIerarchy-Aware Credit Assignment (HICRA), an algorithm that concentrates optimization efforts on high-impact planning tokens. HICRA significantly outperforms strong baselines, demonstrating that focusing on this strategic bottleneck is key to unlocking advanced reasoning. Furthermore, we validate semantic entropy as a superior compass for measuring strategic exploration over misleading metrics such as token-level entropy.

      Training large language models (LLMs) to reason via reinforcement learning (RL) significantly improves their problem-solving capabilities. In agentic settings, existing methods like ReAct prompt LLMs to explicitly plan before every action; however, we demonstrate that always planning is computationally expensive and degrades performance on long-horizon tasks, while never planning further limits performance. To address this, we introduce a conceptual framework formalizing dynamic planning for LLM agents, enabling them to flexibly decide when to allocate test-time compute for planning. We propose a simple two-stage training pipeline: (1) supervised fine-tuning on diverse synthetic data to prime models for dynamic planning, and (2) RL to refine this capability in long-horizon environments. Experiments on the Crafter environment show that dynamic planning agents trained with this approach are more sample-efficient and consistently achieve more complex objectives. Additionally, we demonstrate that these agents can be effectively steered by human-written plans, surpassing their independent capabilities. To our knowledge, this work is the first to explore training LLM agents for dynamic test-time compute allocation in sequential decision-making tasks, paving the way for more efficient, adaptive, and controllable agentic systems.

      Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a variety of tasks, but their increasing autonomy in real-world applications raises concerns about their trustworthiness. While hallucinations-unintentional falsehoods-have been widely studied, the phenomenon of lying, where an LLM knowingly generates falsehoods to achieve an ulterior objective, remains underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the lying behavior of LLMs, differentiating it from hallucinations and testing it in practical scenarios. Through mechanistic interpretability techniques, we uncover the neural mechanisms underlying deception, employing logit lens analysis, causal interventions, and contrastive activation steering to identify and control deceptive behavior. We study real-world lying scenarios and introduce behavioral steering vectors that enable fine-grained manipulation of lying tendencies. Further, we explore the trade-offs between lying and end-task performance, establishing a Pareto frontier where dishonesty can enhance goal optimization.

      Next-generation AI companions must go beyond general video understanding to resolve spatial and temporal references in dynamic, real-world environments. Existing Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs), while capable of coarse-level comprehension, struggle with fine-grained, spatiotemporal reasoning, especially when user queries rely on time-based event references for temporal anchoring, or gestural cues for spatial anchoring to clarify object references and positions. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce Strefer, a synthetic instruction data generation framework designed to equip Video LLMs with spatiotemporal referring and reasoning capabilities. Strefer produces diverse instruction-tuning data using a data engine that pseudo-annotates temporally dense, fine-grained video metadata, capturing rich spatial and temporal information in a structured manner, including subjects, objects, their locations as masklets, and their action descriptions and timelines. Our approach enhances the ability of Video LLMs to interpret spatial and temporal references, fostering more versatile, space-time-aware reasoning essential for real-world AI companions. Without using proprietary models, costly human annotation, or the need to annotate large volumes of new videos, experimental evaluations show that models trained with data produced by Strefer outperform baselines on tasks requiring spatial and temporal disambiguation. Additionally, these models exhibit enhanced space-time-aware reasoning, establishing a new foundation for perceptually grounded, instruction-tuned Video LLMs.

      For RL algorithms, appropriate entropy control is crucial to their effectiveness. To control the policy entropy, a commonly used method is entropy regularization, which is adopted in various popular RL algorithms including PPO, SAC and A3C. Although entropy regularization proves effective in robotic and games RL conventionally, studies found that it gives weak to no gains in LLM-RL training. In this work, we study the issues of entropy bonus in LLM-RL setting. Specifically, we first argue that the conventional entropy regularization suffers from the LLM's extremely large response space and the sparsity of the optimal outputs. As a remedy, we propose AEnt, an entropy control method that utilizes a new clamped entropy bonus with an automatically adjusted coefficient. The clamped entropy is evaluated with the re-normalized policy defined on certain smaller token space, which encourages exploration within a more compact response set. In addition, the algorithm automatically adjusts entropy coefficient according to the clamped entropy value, effectively controlling the entropy-induced bias while leveraging the entropy's benefits. AEnt is tested in math-reasoning tasks under different base models and datasets, and it is observed that AEnt outperforms the baselines consistently across multiple benchmarks.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for cybersecurity threat analysis, but their deployment in security-sensitive environments raises trust and safety concerns. With over 21,000 vulnerabilities disclosed in 2025, manual analysis is infeasible, making scalable and verifiable AI support critical. When querying LLMs, dealing with emerging vulnerabilities is challenging as they have a training cut-off date. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can inject up-to-date context to alleviate the cut-off date limitation, it remains unclear how much LLMs rely on retrieved evidence versus the model's internal knowledge, and whether the retrieved information is meaningful or even correct. This uncertainty could mislead security analysts, mis-prioritize patches, and increase security risks. Therefore, this work proposes LLM Embedding-based Attribution (LEA) to analyze the generated responses for vulnerability exploitation analysis. More specifically, LEA quantifies the relative contribution of internal knowledge vs. retrieved content in the generated responses. We evaluate LEA on 500 critical vulnerabilities disclosed between 2016 and 2025, across three RAG settings -- valid, generic, and incorrect -- using three state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results demonstrate LEA's ability to detect clear distinctions between non-retrieval, generic-retrieval, and valid-retrieval scenarios with over 95% accuracy on larger models. Finally, we demonstrate the limitations posed by incorrect retrieval of vulnerability information and raise a cautionary note to the cybersecurity community regarding the blind reliance on LLMs and RAG for vulnerability analysis. LEA offers security analysts with a metric to audit RAG-enhanced workflows, improving the transparent and trustworthy deployment of AI in cybersecurity threat analysis.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong potential for automating the generation of models from natural-language descriptions. A common approach is an iterative generate-critique-refine loop, where candidate models are produced, evaluated, and updated based on detected issues. This process needs to address: (1) structural correctness - compliance with well-formedness rules - and (2) semantic alignment - accurate reflection of the intended meaning in the source text. We present LADEX (LLM-based Activity Diagram Extractor), a pipeline for deriving activity diagrams from natural-language process descriptions using an LLM-driven critique-refine process. Structural checks in LADEX can be performed either algorithmically or by an LLM, while alignment checks are always performed by an LLM. We design five ablated variants of LADEX to study: (i) the impact of the critique-refine loop itself, (ii) the role of LLM-based semantic checks, and (iii) the comparative effectiveness of algorithmic versus LLM-based structural checks. To evaluate LADEX, we compare the generated activity diagrams with expert-created ground truths using trace-based operational semantics. This enables automated measurement of correctness and completeness. Experiments on two datasets indicate that: (1) the critique-refine loop improves structural validity, correctness, and completeness compared to single-pass generation; (2) algorithmic structural checks eliminate inconsistencies that LLM-based checks fail to detect, improving correctness by an average of 17.81% and completeness by 13.24% over LLM-only checks; and (3) combining algorithmic structural checks with LLM-based semantic checks, implemented using the reasoning-focused O4 Mini, achieves the best overall performance - yielding average correctness of up to 86.37% and average completeness of up to 88.56% - while requiring fewer than five LLM calls on average.

      Recent advances in group-based reinforcement learning (RL) have driven frontier large language models (LLMs) in single-turn tasks like mathematical reasoning. However, their scalability to long-horizon LLM agent training remains limited. Unlike static tasks, agent-environment interactions unfold over many steps and often yield sparse or delayed rewards, making credit assignment across individual steps significantly more challenging. In this work, we propose Group-in-Group Policy Optimization (GiGPO), a novel RL algorithm that achieves fine-grained credit assignment for LLM agents while preserving the appealing properties of group-based RL: critic-free, low memory, and stable convergence. GiGPO introduces a two-level structure for estimating relative advantage: (i) At the episode-level, GiGPO computes macro relative advantages based on groups of complete trajectories; (ii) At the step-level, GiGPO introduces an anchor state grouping mechanism that retroactively constructs step-level groups by identifying repeated environment states across trajectories. Actions stemming from the same state are grouped together, enabling micro relative advantage estimation. This hierarchical structure effectively captures both global trajectory quality and local step effectiveness without relying on auxiliary models or additional rollouts. We evaluate GiGPO on two challenging agent benchmarks, ALFWorld and WebShop, using Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. Crucially, GiGPO delivers fine-grained per-step credit signals and achieves performance gains of > 12\% on ALFWorld and > 9\% on WebShop over the GRPO baseline: all while maintaining the same GPU memory overhead, identical LLM rollout, and incurring little to no additional time cost.

      This paper defines and explores the design space for information extraction (IE) from layout-rich documents using large language models (LLMs). The three core challenges of layout-aware IE with LLMs are 1) data structuring, 2) model engagement, and 3) output refinement. Our study investigates the sub-problems and methods within these core challenges, such as input representation, chunking, prompting, selection of LLMs, and multimodal models. It examines the effect of different design choices through LayIE-LLM, a new, open-source, layout-aware IE test suite, benchmarking against traditional, fine-tuned IE models. The results on two IE datasets show that LLMs require adjustment of the IE pipeline to achieve competitive performance: the optimized configuration found with LayIE-LLM achieves 13.3--37.5 F1 points more than a general-practice baseline configuration using the same LLM. To find a well-working configuration, we develop a one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) method that achieves near-optimal results. Our method is only 0.8--1.8 points lower than the best full factorial exploration with a fraction (2.8%) of the required computation. Overall, we demonstrate that, if well-configured, general-purpose LLMs match the performance of specialized models, providing a cost-effective, finetuning-free alternative.

      Neural network pruning has emerged as a promising approach for deploying LLMs in low-resource scenarios while preserving downstream task performance. However, for the first time, we reveal that such pruning disrupts LLMs' internal activation features crucial for lie detection, where probing classifiers (typically small logistic regression models) trained on these features assess the truthfulness of LLM-generated statements. This discovery raises a crucial open question: how can we prune LLMs without sacrificing these critical lie detection capabilities? Our investigation further reveals that naively adjusting layer-wise pruning sparsity based on importance inadvertently removes crucial weights, failing to improve lie detection performance despite its reliance on the most crucial LLM layer. To address this issue, we propose Truthful Pruning aligned by Layer-wise Outliers (TPLO), which places greater emphasis on layers with more activation outliers and stronger discriminative features simultaneously. This preserves LLMs' original performance while retaining critical features of inner states needed for robust lie detection. Moreover, we introduce a prompting rule to enrich the TruthfulQA benchmark for better calibrating LLM pruning. Empirical results show that our approach improves the hallucination detection for pruned LLMs (achieving 88% accuracy at 50% sparsity) and enhances their performance on TruthfulQA.

      Mooncake is the serving platform for Kimi, a leading LLM service provided by Moonshot AI. It features a KVCache-centric disaggregated architecture that separates the prefill and decoding clusters. It also leverages the underutilized CPU, DRAM, and SSD resources of the GPU cluster to implement a disaggregated cache of KVCache. The core of Mooncake is its KVCache-centric scheduler, which balances maximizing overall effective throughput while meeting latency-related Service Level Objectives (SLOs). Unlike traditional studies that assume all requests will be processed, Mooncake faces challenges due to highly overloaded scenarios. To mitigate these, we developed a prediction-based early rejection policy. Experiments show that Mooncake excels in long-context scenarios. Compared to the baseline method, Mooncake can achieve up to a 525% increase in throughput in certain simulated scenarios while adhering to SLOs. Under real workloads, Mooncake's innovative architecture enables Kimi to handle 75% more requests.

We introduce CXL-NDP, a transparent near-data processing architecture that amplifies effective CXL bandwidth without requiring changes to the CXL.mem interface or AI models. CXL-NDP integrates a precision-scalable bit-plane layout for dynamic quantization with transparent lossless compression of weights and KV caches directly within the CXL device. In end-to-end serving, CXL-NDP improves throughput by 43%, extends the maximum context length by 87%, and reduces the KV cache footprint by 46.9% without accuracy loss.

      Determining the dynamic data dependency of a step that reads a variable $v$ is challenging. It typically requires either exhaustive instrumentation, which becomes prohibitively expensive when $v$ is defined within library calls, or repeated executions, which are impractical for non-deterministic programs. In this work, we propose RecovSlicing for computing dynamic data dependency in a single run, with only partial instrumentation. We explore the intuition that LLM can potentially infer program dynamics based on a partially recorded trace and relevant code as its context. Given (1) a partially recorded trace of a program $P$ and (2) the slicing criteria consisting of a query step $s$ and a query variable $v$ read by $s$, RecovSlicing computes the runtime definition of $v$ on the trace by estimating the miss-recorded execution of $P$. In this work, we allow the user to specify implicit query variable. Technically, built upon non-deterministic LLM, we address the challenges of (1) precise recovery of runtime variable value and structure from the recorded execution and (2) aligning the memory address of recovered variables and the recorded variables for definition analysis. We evaluate RecovSlicing on 8300 data dependencies across three slicing benchmarks, comparing it with Slicer4J, ND-Slicer, LLM Slicer, and re-execution Slicer. RecovSlicing achieves significantly higher accuracy (80.3%, 91.1%, 98.3%) and recall (up to 98.3%) than the best baseline (accuracy: 39.0%, 82.0%, 59.9%; recall: 53.4%, 79.1%, 87.1%). Integrated into a dual-slicing regression bug localizer, it identifies 16% more regressions.

      Federated learning (FL) has enabled the training of multilingual large language models (LLMs) on diverse and decentralized multilingual data, especially on low-resource languages. To improve client-specific performance, personalization via the use of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) modules such as LoRA is common. This involves a personalization strategy (PS), such as the design of the PEFT adapter structures (e.g., in which layers to add LoRAs and what ranks) and choice of hyperparameters (e.g., learning rates) for fine-tuning. Instead of manual PS configuration, we propose FedP$^2$EFT, a federated learning-to-personalize method for multilingual LLMs in cross-device FL settings. Unlike most existing PEFT structure selection methods, which are prone to overfitting low-data regimes, FedP$^2$EFT collaboratively learns the optimal personalized PEFT structure for each client via Bayesian sparse rank selection. Evaluations on both simulated and real-world multilingual FL benchmarks demonstrate that FedP$^2$EFT largely outperforms existing personalized fine-tuning methods, while complementing other existing FL methods.

      Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems, often comprising multiple models, complex tool invocations, and orchestration protocols, substantially outperform monolithic agents. Yet this very sophistication amplifies their fragility, making them more prone to system failure. Pinpointing the specific agent or step responsible for an error within long execution traces defines the task of agentic system failure attribution. Current state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs, however, remain strikingly inadequate for this challenge, with accuracy generally below 10%. To address this gap, we propose AgenTracer, the first automated framework for annotating failed multi-agent trajectories via counterfactual replay and programmed fault injection, producing the curated dataset TracerTraj. Leveraging this resource, we develop AgenTracer-8B, a lightweight failure tracer trained with multi-granular reinforcement learning, capable of efficiently diagnosing errors in verbose multi-agent interactions. On the Who&When benchmark, AgenTracer-8B outperforms giant proprietary LLMs like Gemini-2.5-Pro and Claude-4-Sonnet by up to 18.18%, setting a new standard in LLM agentic failure attribution. More importantly, AgenTracer-8B delivers actionable feedback to off-the-shelf multi-agent systems like MetaGPT and MaAS with 4.8-14.2% performance gains, empowering self-correcting and self-evolving agentic AI.

However, existing benchmarks often lack domain coverage and provide limited insights into the Chinese working context. Leveraging qualification exams as a unified framework for expertise evaluation, we introduce QualBench, the first multi-domain Chinese QA benchmark dedicated to localized assessment of Chinese LLMs. The dataset includes over 17,000 questions across six vertical domains, drawn from 24 Chinese qualifications to align with national policies and professional standards. Results reveal an interesting pattern of Chinese LLMs consistently surpassing non-Chinese models, with the Qwen2.5 model outperforming the more advanced GPT-4o, emphasizing the value of localized domain knowledge in meeting qualification requirements. The average accuracy of 53.98% reveals the current gaps in domain coverage within model capabilities. Furthermore, we identify performance degradation caused by LLM crowdsourcing, assess data contamination, and illustrate the effectiveness of prompt engineering and model fine-tuning, suggesting opportunities for future improvements through multi-domain RAG and Federated Learning.

      Discovering customer intentions is crucial for automated service agents, yet existing intent clustering methods often fall short due to their reliance on embedding distance metrics and neglect of underlying semantic structures. To address these limitations, we propose an LLM-in-the-loop (LLM-ITL) intent clustering framework, integrating the language understanding capabilities of LLMs into conventional clustering algorithms. Specifically, this paper (1) examines the effectiveness of fine-tuned LLMs in semantic coherence evaluation and intent cluster naming, achieving over 95% accuracy aligned with human judgments; (2) designs an LLM-ITL framework that facilitates the iterative discovery of coherent intent clusters and the optimal number of clusters; and (3) introduces context-aware techniques tailored for customer service dialogue. Since existing English benchmarks lack sufficient semantic diversity and intent coverage, we further present a comprehensive Chinese dialogue intent dataset comprising over 100k real customer service calls with 1,507 human-annotated clusters. The proposed approaches significantly outperform LLM-guided baselines, achieving notable improvements in clustering quality, cost efficiency, and downstream applications. Combined with several best practices, our findings highlight the prominence of LLM-in-the-loop techniques for scalable dialogue data mining.

      In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a prominent area of interest across various research domains, including Process Mining (PM). Current applications in PM have predominantly centered on prompt engineering strategies or the transformation of event logs into narrative-style datasets, thereby exploiting the semantic capabilities of LLMs to address diverse tasks. In contrast, this study investigates the direct adaptation of pretrained LLMs to process data without natural language reformulation, motivated by the fact that these models excel in generating sequences of tokens, similar to the objective in PM. More specifically, we focus on parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques to mitigate the computational overhead typically associated with such models. Our experimental setup focuses on Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM), and considers both single- and multi-task predictions. The results demonstrate a potential improvement in predictive performance over state-of-the-art recurrent neural network (RNN) approaches and recent narrative-style-based solutions, particularly in the multi-task setting. Additionally, our fine-tuned models exhibit faster convergence and require significantly less hyperparameter optimization.

      The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has greatly enhanced reasoning tasks and facilitated the development of LLM-based applications. A critical factor in improving LLM-based applications is the design of effective system prompts, which significantly impact the behavior and output quality of LLMs. However, system prompts are susceptible to theft and misuse, which could undermine the interests of prompt owners. Existing methods protect prompt copyrights through watermark injection and verification but face challenges due to their reliance on intermediate LLM outputs (e.g., logits), which limits their practical feasibility. In this paper, we propose PromptCOS, a method for auditing prompt copyright based on content-level output similarity. It embeds watermarks by optimizing the prompt while simultaneously co-optimizing a special verification query and content-level signal marks. This is achieved by leveraging cyclic output signals and injecting auxiliary tokens to ensure reliable auditing in content-only scenarios. Additionally, it incorporates cover tokens to protect the watermark from malicious deletion. For copyright verification, PromptCOS identifies unauthorized usage by comparing the similarity between the suspicious output and the signal mark. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high effectiveness (99.3% average watermark similarity), strong distinctiveness (60.8% greater than the best baseline), high fidelity (accuracy degradation of no more than 0.58%), robustness (resilience against three types of potential attacks), and computational efficiency (up to 98.1% reduction in computational cost).

      Many constructs that characterize language, like its complexity or emotionality, have a naturally continuous semantic structure; a public speech is not just "simple" or "complex," but exists on a continuum between extremes. Although large language models (LLMs) are an attractive tool for measuring scalar constructs, their idiosyncratic treatment of numerical outputs raises questions of how to best apply them. We address these questions with a comprehensive evaluation of LLM-based approaches to scalar construct measurement in social science. Using multiple datasets sourced from the political science literature, we evaluate four approaches: unweighted direct pointwise scoring, aggregation of pairwise comparisons, token-probability-weighted pointwise scoring, and finetuning. Our study yields actionable findings for applied researchers. First, LLMs prompted to generate pointwise scores directly from texts produce discontinuous distributions with bunching at arbitrary numbers. The quality of the measurements improves with pairwise comparisons made by LLMs, but it improves even more by taking pointwise scores and weighting them by token probability. Finally, finetuning smaller models with as few as 1,000 training pairs can match or exceed the performance of prompted LLMs.

      Despite their powerful chat, coding, and reasoning abilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently hallucinate. Conventional wisdom suggests that hallucinations are a consequence of a balance between creativity and factuality, which can be mitigated, but not eliminated, by grounding the LLM in external knowledge sources. Through extensive systematic experiments, we show that these traditional approaches fail to explain why LLMs hallucinate in practice. Specifically, we show that LLMs augmented with a massive Mixture of Memory Experts (MoME) can easily memorize large datasets of random numbers. We corroborate these experimental findings with a theoretical construction showing that simple neural networks trained to predict the next token hallucinate when the training loss is above a threshold as it usually does in practice when training on internet scale data. We interpret our findings by comparing against traditional retrieval methods for mitigating hallucinations. We use our findings to design a first generation model for removing hallucinations -- Lamini-1 -- that stores facts in a massive mixture of millions of memory experts that are retrieved dynamically.

      Traditional static analysis methods struggle to detect semantic design flaws, such as violations of the SOLID principles, which require a strong understanding of object-oriented design patterns and principles. Existing solutions typically focus on individual SOLID principles or specific programming languages, leaving a gap in the ability to detect violations across all five principles in multi-language codebases. This paper presents a new approach: a methodology that leverages tailored prompt engineering to assess LLMs on their ability to detect SOLID violations across multiple languages. We present a benchmark of four leading LLMs-CodeLlama, DeepSeekCoder, QwenCoder, and GPT-4o Mini-on their ability to detect violations of all five SOLID principles. For this evaluation, we construct a new benchmark dataset of 240 manually validated code examples. Using this dataset, we test four distinct prompt strategies inspired by established zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought techniques to systematically measure their impact on detection accuracy. Our emerging results reveal a stark hierarchy among models, with GPT-4o Mini decisively outperforming others, yet even struggles with challenging principles like DIP. Crucially, we show that prompt strategy has a dramatic impact, but no single strategy is universally best; for instance, a deliberative ENSEMBLE prompt excels at OCP detection while a hint-based EXAMPLE prompt is superior for DIP violations. Across all experiments, detection accuracy is heavily influenced by language characteristics and degrades sharply with increasing code complexity. These initial findings demonstrate that effective, AI-driven design analysis requires not a single best model, but a tailored approach that matches the right model and prompt to the specific design context, highlighting the potential of LLMs to support maintainability through AI-assisted code analysis.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness across a wide variety of tasks involving natural language, however, a fundamental problem of hallucinations still plagues these models, limiting their trustworthiness in generating consistent, truthful information. Detecting hallucinations has quickly become an important topic, with various methods such as uncertainty estimation, LLM Judges, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and consistency checks showing promise. Many of these methods build upon foundational metrics, such as ROUGE, BERTScore, or Perplexity, which often lack the semantic depth necessary to detect hallucinations effectively. In this work, we propose a novel approach inspired by ROUGE that constructs an N-Gram frequency tensor from LLM-generated text. This tensor captures richer semantic structure by encoding co-occurrence patterns, enabling better differentiation between factual and hallucinated content. We demonstrate this by applying tensor decomposition methods to extract singular values from each mode and use these as input features to train a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) binary classifier for hallucinations. Our method is evaluated on the HaluEval dataset and demonstrates significant improvements over traditional baselines, as well as competitive performance against state-of-the-art LLM judges.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, but require substantial memory and computational resources. Binary quantization, which compresses model weights from 16-bit Brain Float to 1-bit representations in {-1, 1}, offers significant reductions in storage and inference costs. However, such aggressive quantization often leads to notable performance degradation compared to more conservative 4-bit quantization methods. In this research, we propose a novel optimization objective tailored for binary quantization, along with three algorithms designed to realize it effectively. Our method enhances blocked quantization by dynamically identifying optimal unstructured sub-matrices through adaptive grouping strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves an average bit length of just 1.007 bits, while maintaining high model quality. Specifically, our quantized LLaMA 3.2 3B model attains a perplexity of 8.23, remarkably close to the original 7.81, and surpasses previous SOTA BiLLM with a perplexity of only 123.90. Furthermore, our method is competitive with SOTA 4-bit approaches such as GPTQ in both performance and efficiency. The compression process is highly efficient, requiring only 14 seconds to quantize the full LLaMA 3.2 3B weights on a single CPU core, with the entire process completing in under 100 minutes and exhibiting embarrassingly parallel properties.

A major concern is the substantial loss of training time caused by inevitable hardware and software failures. To address these challenges, we present FlashRecovery, a fast and low-cost failure recovery system comprising three core modules: (1) Active and real-time failure detection. This module performs continuous training state monitoring, enabling immediate identification of hardware and software failures within seconds, thus ensuring rapid incident response; (2) Scale-independent task restart. By employing different recovery strategies for normal and faulty nodes, combined with an optimized communication group reconstruction protocol, our approach ensures that the recovery time remains nearly constant, regardless of cluster scale; (3) Checkpoint-free recovery within one step. Our novel recovery mechanism enables single-step restoration, completely eliminating dependence on traditional checkpointing methods and their associated overhead. Collectively, these innovations enable FlashRecovery to achieve optimal Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO), substantially improving the reliability and efficiency of long-duration LLM training. Experimental results demonstrate that FlashRecovery system can achieve training restoration on training cluster with 4, 800 devices in 150 seconds. We also verify that the time required for failure recovery is nearly consistent for different scales of training tasks.

We introduce SchedCP, the first framework that enables fully autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents to safely and efficiently optimize Linux schedulers without human involvement. Our core insight is that the challenge is not merely to apply a better LLM, but to architect a decoupled control plane that separates the AI's role of semantic reasoning ("what to optimize") from the system's role of execution ("how to observe and act"). Implemented as Model Context Protocol(MCP) server, SchedCP provides a stable interface with three key services: a Workload Analysis Engine, an evolving Scheduler Policy Repository, and an Execution Verifier that validates all AI-generated code and configure before deployment with static and dynamic analysis. We demonstrate this architecture's power with sched-agent, a multi-agent system that autonomously analyzes workloads, synthesizes custom eBPF scheduling policies, and deploys them via the sched\_ext infrastructure. Our evaluation shows that SchedCP achieves up to an 1.79x performance improvement, and a 13x cost reduction compared to naive agentic approaches, all while maintaining high success rate. By bridging the semantic gap, SchedCP democratizes expert-level system optimization and represents a step towards creating truly self-optimizing, application-aware operating systems.

We introduce HERCULES (Hierarchical Embedding-based Recursive Clustering Using LLMs for Efficient Summarization), a novel algorithm and Python package designed for hierarchical k-means clustering of diverse data types, including text, images, and numeric data (processed one modality per run). HERCULES constructs a cluster hierarchy by recursively applying k-means clustering, starting from individual data points at level 0. A key innovation is its deep integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantically rich titles and descriptions for clusters at each level of the hierarchy, significantly enhancing interpretability. The algorithm supports two main representation modes: `direct' mode, which clusters based on original data embeddings or scaled numeric features, and `description' mode, which clusters based on embeddings derived from LLM-generated summaries. Users can provide a `topic\_seed' to guide LLM-generated summaries towards specific themes. An interactive visualization tool facilitates thorough analysis and understanding of the clustering results. We demonstrate HERCULES's capabilities and discuss its potential for extracting meaningful, hierarchical knowledge from complex datasets.

      Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been explored as powerful text embedders. Existing LLM-based text embedding approaches often leverage the embedding of the final token, typically a reserved special token such as [EOS]. However, these tokens have not been intentionally trained to capture the semantics of the whole context, limiting their capacity as text embeddings, especially for retrieval and re-ranking tasks. We propose to add a new training stage before contrastive learning to enrich the semantics of the final token embedding. This stage employs bidirectional generative reconstruction tasks, namely EBQ2D (Embedding-Based Query-to-Document) and EBD2Q (Embedding-Based Document-to-Query), which interleave to anchor the [EOS] embedding and reconstruct either side of Query-Document pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that our additional training stage significantly improves LLM performance on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), achieving new state-of-the-art results across different LLM base models and scales.

      Reliability is essential for ensuring efficiency in LLM training. However, many real-world reliability issues remain difficult to resolve, resulting in wasted resources and degraded model performance. Unfortunately, today's collective communication libraries operate as black boxes, hiding critical information needed for effective root cause analysis. We propose Mycroft, a lightweight distributed tracing and root cause analysis system designed to address previously hidden reliability issues in collective communication. Mycroft's key idea is to trace collective communication states and leverage internal control and data dependencies to resolve reliability problems in LLM training. Mycroft has been deployed at ByteDance for over six months to debug collective communication related issues at runtime. It detected anomalies within 15 seconds in 90% of cases and identified the root cause within 20 seconds in 60% of cases. We also conducted extensive fault injection experiments to demonstrate Mycroft's capability and efficiency.

      The complexity of traditional power system analysis workflows presents significant barriers to efficient decision-making in modern electric grids. This paper presents GridMind, a multi-agent AI system that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with deterministic engineering solvers to enable conversational scientific computing for power system analysis. The system employs specialized agents coordinating AC Optimal Power Flow and N-1 contingency analysis through natural language interfaces while maintaining numerical precision via function calls.

Experimental evaluation on IEEE test cases demonstrates that the proposed agentic framework consistently delivers correct solutions across all tested language models, with smaller LLMs achieving comparable analytical accuracy with reduced computational latency.

      Training LLMs larger than the aggregated memory of multiple GPUs is increasingly necessary due to the faster growth of LLM sizes compared to GPU memory. To this end, multi-tier host memory or disk offloading techniques are proposed by state of art. Despite advanced asynchronous multi-tier read/write strategies, such offloading strategies result in significant I/O overheads in the critical path of training, resulting in slower iterations. To this end, we propose MLP-Offload, a novel multi-level, multi-path offloading engine specifically designed for optimizing LLM training on resource-constrained setups by mitigating I/O bottlenecks. We make several key observations that drive the design of MLP-Offload, such as I/O overheads during the update dominate the iteration time; I/O bandwidth of the third-level remote storage tier remains unutilized; and, contention due to concurrent offloading amplifies I/O bottlenecks. Driven by these insights, we design and implement MLP-Offload to offload the optimizer states across multiple tiers in a cache-efficient and concurrency-controlled fashion to mitigate I/O bottlenecks during the backward and update phases. Evaluations on models up to 280B parameters shows that MLP-Offload achieves 2.5$\times$ faster iterations compared to the state-of-the-art LLM training runtimes.

      Do LLMs genuinely incorporate external definitions, or do they primarily rely on their parametric knowledge? To address these questions, we conduct controlled experiments across multiple explanation benchmark datasets (general and domain-specific) and label definition conditions, including expert-curated, LLM-generated, perturbed, and swapped definitions. Our results reveal that while explicit label definitions can enhance accuracy and explainability, their integration into an LLM's task-solving processes is neither guaranteed nor consistent, suggesting reliance on internalized representations in many cases. Models often default to their internal representations, particularly in general tasks, whereas domain-specific tasks benefit more from explicit definitions. These findings underscore the need for a deeper understanding of how LLMs process external knowledge alongside their pre-existing capabilities.

      Kubernetes has become the foundation of modern cloud-native infrastructure, yet its management remains complex and fragmented. Administrators must navigate a vast API surface, manage heterogeneous workloads, and coordinate tasks across disconnected tools - often requiring precise commands, YAML configuration, and contextual expertise. This paper presents KubeIntellect, a Large Language Model (LLM)-powered system for intelligent, end-to-end Kubernetes control. Unlike existing tools that focus on observability or static automation, KubeIntellect supports natural language interaction across the full spectrum of Kubernetes API operations, including read, write, delete, exec, access control, lifecycle, and advanced verbs. The system uses modular agents aligned with functional domains (e.g., logs, metrics, RBAC), orchestrated by a supervisor that interprets user queries, maintains workflow memory, invokes reusable tools, or synthesizes new ones via a secure Code Generator Agent. KubeIntellect integrates memory checkpoints, human-in-the-loop clarification, and dynamic task sequencing into a structured orchestration framework. Evaluation results show a 93% tool synthesis success rate and 100% reliability across 200 natural language queries, demonstrating the system's ability to operate efficiently under diverse workloads. An automated demo environment is provided on Azure, with additional support for local testing via kind. This work introduces a new class of interpretable, extensible, and LLM-driven systems for managing complex infrastructure.

      Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a variety of tasks. One of the main challenges towards the successful deployment of LLMs is memory management, since they typically involve billions of parameters. To this end, architectures based on Mixture-of-Experts have been proposed, which aim to reduce the size of the parameters that are activated when producing a token. This raises the equally critical issue of efficiently managing the limited cache of the system, in that frequently used experts should be stored in the fast cache rather than in the slower secondary memory. In this work, we introduce and study a new paging problem that models expert management optimization. Our formulation captures both the layered architecture of LLMs and the requirement that experts are cached efficiently. We first present lower bounds on the competitive ratio of both deterministic and randomized algorithms, which show that under mild assumptions, LRU-like policies have good theoretical competitive performance. We then propose a layer-based extension of LRU that is tailored to the problem at hand. Extensive simulations on both synthetic datasets and actual traces of MoE usage show that our algorithm outperforms policies for the classic paging problem, such as the standard LRU.

      Relatively many past AI safety discussions have centered around the dangers of unbounded utility maximisation by RL agents, illustrated by scenarios like the "paperclip maximiser" or by specification gaming in general. Unbounded maximisation is problematic for many reasons. We wanted to verify whether these RL runaway optimisation problems are still relevant with LLMs as well. Turns out, strangely, this is indeed clearly the case. The problem is not that the LLMs just lose context or become incoherent. The problem is that in various scenarios, LLMs lose context in very specific ways, which systematically resemble runaway optimisers in the following distinct ways: 1) Ignoring homeostatic targets and "defaulting" to unbounded maximisation instead. 2) It is equally concerning that the "default" meant also reverting back to single-objective optimisation. Our findings also suggest that long-running scenarios are important. Systematic failures emerge after periods of initially successful behaviour. In some trials the LLMs were successful until the end. This means, while current LLMs do conceptually grasp biological and economic alignment, they exhibit randomly triggered problematic behavioural tendencies under sustained long-running conditions, particularly involving multiple or competing objectives. Once they flip, they usually do not recover. Even though LLMs look multi-objective and bounded on the surface, the underlying mechanisms seem to be actually still biased towards being single-objective and unbounded.

      Failure Analysis (FA) is a highly intricate and knowledge-intensive process. The integration of AI components within the computational infrastructure of FA labs has the potential to automate a variety of tasks, including the detection of non-conformities in images, the retrieval of analogous cases from diverse data sources, and the generation of reports from annotated images. However, as the number of deployed AI models increases, the challenge lies in orchestrating these components into cohesive and efficient workflows that seamlessly integrate with the FA process. This paper investigates the design and implementation of an agentic AI system for semiconductor FA using a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Planning Agent (LPA). The LPA integrates LLMs with advanced planning capabilities and external tool utilization, allowing autonomous processing of complex queries, retrieval of relevant data from external systems, and generation of human-readable responses. The evaluation results demonstrate the agent's operational effectiveness and reliability in supporting FA tasks.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have become critical to modern software development, but their reliance on internet datasets for training introduces a significant security risk: the absorption and reproduction of malicious content. To evaluate this threat, this paper introduces a scalable, automated audit framework that synthesizes innocuous, developer-style prompts from known scam databases to query production LLMs and determine if they generate code containing harmful URLs. We conducted a large-scale evaluation across four production LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Llama-4-Scout, and DeepSeek-V3), and found a systemic vulnerability, with all tested models generating malicious code at a non-negligible rate. On average, 4.2\% of programs generated in our experiments contained malicious URLs. Crucially, this malicious code is often generated in response to benign prompts. We manually validate the prompts which cause all four LLMs to generate malicious code, and resulting in 177 innocuous prompts that trigger all models to produce harmful outputs. These results provide strong empirical evidence that the training data of production LLMs has been successfully poisoned at scale, underscoring the urgent need for more robust defense mechanisms and post-generation safety checks to mitigate the propagation of hidden security threats.

      Modern LLM serving systems confront inefficient GPU utilization due to the fundamental mismatch between compute-intensive prefill and memory-bound decode phases. While current practices attempt to address this by organizing these phases into hybrid batches, such solutions create an inefficient tradeoff that sacrifices either throughput or latency, leaving substantial GPU resources underutilized. We identify two key root causes: 1) the prefill phase suffers from suboptimal compute utilization due to wave quantization and attention bottlenecks. 2) hybrid batches disproportionately prioritize latency over throughput, resulting in wasted compute and memory bandwidth. To mitigate the issues, we present Bullet, a novel spatial-temporal orchestration system that eliminates these inefficiencies through precise phase coordination. Bullet enables concurrent execution of prefill and decode phases, while dynamically provisioning GPU resources using real-time performance modeling. By integrating SLO-aware scheduling and adaptive resource allocation, Bullet maximizes utilization without compromising latency targets. Experimental evaluations on real-world workloads demonstrate that Bullet delivers 1.26x average throughput gains (up to 1.55x) over state-of-the-arts, while consistently meeting latency constraints.

      Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in code-related tasks, such as code generation and automated program repair. Despite their promising performance, most existing approaches for code repair suffer from high training costs or computationally expensive inference. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), with its efficient in-context learning paradigm, offers a more scalable alternative. However, conventional retrieval strategies, which are often based on holistic code-text embeddings, fail to capture the structural intricacies of code, resulting in suboptimal retrieval quality. To address the above limitations, we propose ReCode, a fine-grained retrieval-augmented in-context learning framework designed for accurate and efficient code repair. Specifically, ReCode introduces two key innovations: (1) an algorithm-aware retrieval strategy that narrows the search space using preliminary algorithm type predictions; and (2) a modular dual-encoder architecture that separately processes code and textual inputs, enabling fine-grained semantic matching between input and retrieved contexts. Furthermore, we propose RACodeBench, a new benchmark constructed from real-world user-submitted buggy code, which addresses the limitations of synthetic benchmarks and supports realistic evaluation. Experimental results on RACodeBench and competitive programming datasets demonstrate that ReCode achieves higher repair accuracy with significantly reduced inference cost, highlighting its practical value for real-world code repair scenarios.

      Language-guided long-horizon manipulation of deformable objects presents significant challenges due to high degrees of freedom, complex dynamics, and the need for accurate vision-language grounding. In this work, we focus on multi-step cloth folding, a representative deformable-object manipulation task that requires both structured long-horizon planning and fine-grained visual perception. To this end, we propose a unified framework that integrates a Large Language Model (LLM)-based planner, a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based perception system, and a task execution module. Specifically, the LLM-based planner decomposes high-level language instructions into low-level action primitives, bridging the semantic-execution gap, aligning perception with action, and enhancing generalization. The VLM-based perception module employs a SigLIP2-driven architecture with a bidirectional cross-attention fusion mechanism and weight-decomposed low-rank adaptation (DoRA) fine-tuning to achieve language-conditioned fine-grained visual grounding. Experiments in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate the method's effectiveness. In simulation, it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 2.23, 1.87, and 33.3 on seen instructions, unseen instructions, and unseen tasks, respectively. On a real robot, it robustly executes multi-step folding sequences from language instructions across diverse cloth materials and configurations, demonstrating strong generalization in practical scenarios.

      The art of heuristic design has traditionally been a human pursuit. While Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate code for search heuristics, their application has largely been confined to adjusting simple functions within human-crafted frameworks, leaving their capacity for broader innovation an open question. To investigate this, we tasked an LLM with building a complete solver for the constrained 3D Packing Problem. Direct code generation quickly proved fragile, prompting us to introduce two supports: constraint scaffolding--prewritten constraint-checking code--and iterative self-correction--additional refinement cycles to repair bugs and produce a viable initial population. Notably, even within a vast search space in a greedy process, the LLM concentrated its efforts almost exclusively on refining the scoring function. This suggests that the emphasis on scoring functions in prior work may reflect not a principled strategy, but rather a natural limitation of LLM capabilities. The resulting heuristic was comparable to a human-designed greedy algorithm, and when its scoring function was integrated into a human-crafted metaheuristic, its performance rivaled established solvers, though its effectiveness waned as constraints tightened. Our findings highlight two major barriers to automated heuristic design with current LLMs: the engineering required to mitigate their fragility in complex reasoning tasks, and the influence of pretrained biases, which can prematurely narrow the search for novel solutions.

We present a novel, two-step framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) both as human-style annotators of team dialogues to track the team's shared mental models (SMMs) and as automated discrepancy detectors among individuals' mental states. In the first step, an LLM generates annotations by identifying SMM elements within task-oriented dialogues from the Cooperative Remote Search Task (CReST) corpus. Then, a secondary LLM compares these LLM-derived annotations and human annotations against gold-standard labels to detect and characterize divergences. We define an SMM coherence evaluation framework for this use case and apply it to six CReST dialogues, ultimately producing: (1) a dataset of human and LLM annotations; (2) a reproducible evaluation framework for SMM coherence; and (3) an empirical assessment of LLM-based discrepancy detection. Our results reveal that, although LLMs exhibit apparent coherence on straightforward natural-language annotation tasks, they systematically err in scenarios requiring spatial reasoning or disambiguation of prosodic cues.

      The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has had a profoundly transformative effect on a number of fields and domains. However, their uptake in Law has proven more challenging due to the important issues of reliability and transparency. In this study, we present a structured prompting methodology as a viable alternative to the often expensive fine-tuning, with the capability of tacking long legal documents from the CUAD dataset on the task of information retrieval. Each document is first split into chunks via a system of chunking and augmentation, addressing the long document problem. Then, alongside an engineered prompt, the input is fed into QWEN-2 to produce a set of answers for each question. Finally, we tackle the resulting candidate selection problem with the introduction of the Distribution-based Localisation and Inverse Cardinality Weighting heuristics. This approach leverages a general purpose model to promote long term scalability, prompt engineering to increase reliability and the two heuristic strategies to reduce the impact of the black box effect. Whilst our model performs up to 9\% better than the previously presented method, reaching state-of-the-art performance, it also highlights the limiting factor of current automatic evaluation metrics for question answering, serving as a call to action for future research. However, the chief aim of this work is to underscore the potential of structured prompt engineering as a useful, yet under-explored, tool in ensuring accountability and responsibility of AI in the legal domain, and beyond.

      When complex SQL queries suffer slow executions despite query optimization, DBAs typically invoke automated query rewriting tools to recommend ``lean'' equivalents that are conducive to faster execution. The rewritings are usually achieved via transformation rules, but these rules are limited in scope and difficult to update in a production system. Recently, LLM-based techniques have also been suggested, but they are prone to semantic and syntactic errors. We investigate here how the remarkable cognitive capabilities of LLMs can be leveraged for performant query rewriting while incorporating safeguards and optimizations to ensure correctness and efficiency. Our study shows that these goals can be progressively achieved through incorporation of (a) an ensemble suite of basic prompts, (b) database-sensitive prompts via redundancy removal and selectivity-based rewriting rules, and (c) LLM token probability-guided rewrite paths. Further, a suite of logic-based and statistical tools can be used to check for semantic violations in the rewrites prior to DBA consideration. We have implemented the above LLM-infused techniques in the LITHE system, and evaluated complex analytic queries from standard benchmarks on contemporary database platforms. The results show significant performance improvements for slow queries, over both SOTA rewriters and the native optimizer. For instance, with TPC-DS on PostgreSQL, the GM of runtime speedups was a high 13.2 over the native optimizer, whereas SOTA only gave 4.9. Overall, LITHE is a promising step toward viable LLM-based advisory tools for ameliorating enterprise query performance.

      The rapid technical progress of generative art (GenArt) has democratized the creation of visually appealing imagery. However, achieving genuine artistic impact - the kind that resonates with viewers on a deeper, more meaningful level - remains formidable as it requires a sophisticated aesthetic sensibility. This sensibility involves a multifaceted cognitive process extending beyond mere visual appeal, which is often overlooked by current computational methods. This paper pioneers an approach to capture this complex process by investigating how the reasoning capabilities of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) can be effectively elicited to perform aesthetic judgment. Our analysis reveals a critical challenge: MLLMs exhibit a tendency towards hallucinations during aesthetic reasoning, characterized by subjective opinions and unsubstantiated artistic interpretations. We further demonstrate that these hallucinations can be suppressed by employing an evidence-based and objective reasoning process, as substantiated by our proposed baseline, ArtCoT. MLLMs prompted by this principle produce multifaceted, in-depth aesthetic reasoning that aligns significantly better with human judgment. These findings have direct applications in areas such as AI art tutoring and as reward models for image generation. Ultimately, we hope this work paves the way for AI systems that can truly understand, appreciate, and contribute to art that aligns with human aesthetic values.

      Evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is an essential step to ensure the successful application of LLMs across various domains. The current evaluation of LLMs is based on a paradigm that involves querying them with predefined question sets and assessing their outputs. This paradigm offers controllable processes and simplicity, but faces challenges such as limited interaction with targets, insufficient difficulty control, and difficulties in verifying the validity of evaluation results, making it hard to precisely determine the knowledge and capability boundaries of target models. To address these challenges, we propose JudgeAgent, a knowledge-target adaptive dynamic evaluation framework based on a new interviewer-style evaluation paradigm. JudgeAgent employs a comprehensive evaluation approach consisting of benchmark grading, interactive extension, and evaluation feedback. It utilizes knowledge-driven data synthesis and target-adaptive difficulty adjustment methods to conduct extended testing, providing accurate and effective evaluation results. We also introduce a novel insight into validating evaluation methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of JudgeAgent and its dynamic evaluation paradigm through extensive experiments.
