      Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a challenging problem that requires to process multimodal input. Answer-Set Programming (ASP) has shown great potential in this regard to add interpretability and explainability to modular VQA architectures. In this work, we address the problem of how to integrate ASP with modules for vision and natural language processing to solve a new and demanding VQA variant that is concerned with images of graphs (not graphs in symbolic form). Images containing graph-based structures are an ubiquitous and popular form of visualisation. Here, we deal with the particular problem of graphs inspired by transit networks, and we introduce a novel dataset that amends an existing one by adding images of graphs that resemble metro lines. Our modular neuro-symbolic approach combines optical graph recognition for graph parsing, a pretrained optical character recognition neural network for parsing labels, Large Language Models (LLMs) for language processing, and ASP for reasoning. This method serves as a first baseline and achieves an overall average accuracy of 73% on the dataset. Our evaluation provides further evidence of the potential of modular neuro-symbolic systems, in particular with pretrained models that do not involve any further training and logic programming for reasoning, to solve complex VQA tasks.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on petabytes of data are highly compressed repositories of a significant proportion of the knowledge accumulated and distilled so far. In this paper we study techniques to elicit this knowledge in the form of several classes of logic programs, including propositional Horn clauses, Dual Horn clauses, relational triplets and Definite Clause Grammars. Exposing this knowledge as logic programs enables sound reasoning methods that can verify alignment of LLM outputs to their intended uses and extend their inference capabilities. We study new execution methods for the generated programs, including soft-unification of abducible facts against LLM-generated content stored in a vector database as well as GPU-based acceleration of minimal model computation that supports inference with large LLM-generated programs.

      Legal cases require careful logical reasoning following the laws, whereas interactions with non- technical users must be in natural language. As an application combining logical reasoning using Prolog and natural language processing using large language models (LLMs), this paper presents a novel approach and system, LogicLease, to automate the analysis of landlord-tenant legal cases in the state of New York. LogicLease determines compliance with relevant legal requirements by analyzing case descriptions and citing all relevant laws. It leverages LLMs for information extraction and Prolog for legal reasoning. By separating information extraction from legal reasoning, LogicLease achieves greater transparency and control over the legal logic applied to each case. We evaluate the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of LogicLease through a series of tests, achieving 100% accuracy and an average processing time of 2.57 seconds. LogicLease presents advantages over state-of-the-art LLM- based legal analysis systems by providing clear, step-by-step reasoning, citing specific laws, and distinguishing itself by its ability to avoid hallucinations - a common issue in LLMs.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Anthropomorphism, or the attribution of human traits to technology, is an automatic and unconscious response that occurs even in those with advanced technical expertise. In this position paper, we analyze hundreds of thousands of computer science research articles from the past decade and present empirical evidence of the prevalence and growth of anthropomorphic terminology in research on large language models (LLMs). This terminology reflects deeper anthropomorphic conceptualizations which shape how we think about and conduct LLM research. We argue these conceptualizations may be limiting, and that challenging them opens up new pathways for understanding and improving LLMs beyond human analogies. To illustrate this, we identify and analyze five core anthropomorphic assumptions shaping prominent methodologies across the LLM development lifecycle, from the assumption that models must use natural language for reasoning tasks to the assumption that model capabilities should be evaluated through human-centric benchmarks. For each assumption, we demonstrate how non-anthropomorphic alternatives can open new directions for research and development.

      Large language models (LLMs), pre-trained or fine-tuned on large code corpora, have shown effectiveness in generating code completions. However, in LLM-based code completion, LLMs may struggle to use correct and up-to-date Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) due to the rapid and continuous evolution of libraries. While existing studies have highlighted issues with predicting incorrect APIs, the specific problem of deprecated API usage in LLM-based code completion has not been thoroughly investigated. To address this gap, we conducted the first evaluation study on deprecated API usage in LLM-based code completion. This study involved seven advanced LLMs, 145 API mappings from eight popular Python libraries, and 28,125 completion prompts. The study results reveal the status quo (i.e., API usage plausibility and deprecated usage rate) of deprecated API and replacing API usage in LLM-based code completion from the perspectives of model, prompt, and library, and indicate the root causes behind. Based on these findings, we propose two lightweight fixing approaches, REPLACEAPI and INSERTPROMPT, which can serve as baseline approaches for future research on mitigating deprecated API usage in LLM-based completion. Additionally, we provide implications for future research on integrating library evolution with LLM-driven software development.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced significant challenges in moderating user-model interactions. While LLMs demonstrate remarkable capabilities, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, particularly ``jailbreaking'' techniques that bypass content safety measures. Current content moderation systems, which primarily rely on input prompt filtering, have proven insufficient, with techniques like Best-of-N (BoN) jailbreaking achieving success rates of 80% or more against popular LLMs. In this paper, we introduce Flexible LLM-Assisted Moderation Engine (FLAME): a new approach that shifts the focus from input filtering to output moderation. Unlike traditional circuit-breaking methods that analyze user queries, FLAME evaluates model responses, offering several key advantages: (1) computational efficiency in both training and inference, (2) enhanced resistance to BoN jailbreaking attacks, and (3) flexibility in defining and updating safety criteria through customizable topic filtering. Our experiments demonstrate that FLAME significantly outperforms current moderation systems. For example, FLAME reduces attack success rate in GPT-4o-mini and DeepSeek-v3 by a factor of ~9, while maintaining low computational overhead. We provide comprehensive evaluation on various LLMs and analyze the engine's efficiency against the state-of-the-art jailbreaking. This work contributes to the development of more robust and adaptable content moderation systems for LLMs.

      Objectives: Large language models (LLMs) can harness medical knowledge for intelligent question answering (Q&A), promising support for auxiliary diagnosis and medical talent cultivation. However, there is a deficiency of highly efficient retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks within the domain of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Our purpose is to observe the effect of the Tree-Organized Self-Reflective Retrieval (TOSRR) framework on LLMs in TCM Q&A tasks. Materials and Methods: We introduce the novel approach of knowledge organization, constructing a tree structure knowledge base with hierarchy. At inference time, our self-reflection framework retrieves from this knowledge base, integrating information across chapters. Questions from the TCM Medical Licensing Examination (MLE) and the college Classics Course Exam (CCE) were randomly selected as benchmark datasets. Results: By coupling with GPT-4, the framework can improve the best performance on the TCM MLE benchmark by 19.85% in absolute accuracy, and improve recall accuracy from 27% to 38% on CCE datasets. In manual evaluation, the framework improves a total of 18.52 points across dimensions of safety, consistency, explainability, compliance, and coherence. Conclusion: The TOSRR framework can effectively improve LLM's capability in Q&A tasks of TCM.

      Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in understanding and generation. However, when interacting with human instructions in real-world scenarios, LLMs still face significant challenges, particularly in accurately capturing and comprehending human instructions and intentions. This paper focuses on three challenges in LLM-based text generation tasks: instruction understanding, intention reasoning, and reliable generation. Regarding human complex instruction, LLMs have deficiencies in understanding long contexts and instructions in multi-round conversations. For intention reasoning, LLMs may have inconsistent command reasoning, difficulty reasoning about commands containing incorrect information, difficulty understanding user ambiguous language commands, and a weak understanding of user intention in commands. Besides, In terms of reliable generation, LLMs may have unstable generated content and unethical generation. To this end, we classify and analyze the performance of LLMs in challenging scenarios and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of existing solutions. Furthermore, we introduce benchmarks and categorize them based on the aforementioned three core challenges. Finally, we explore potential directions for future research to enhance the reliability and adaptability of LLMs in real-world applications.

      The ability to wield tools was once considered exclusive to human intelligence, but it's now known that many other animals, like crows, possess this capability. Yet, robotic systems still fall short of matching biological dexterity. In this paper, we investigate the use of Large Language Models (LLMs), tool affordances, and object manoeuvrability for non-prehensile tool-based manipulation tasks. Our novel method leverages LLMs based on scene information and natural language instructions to enable symbolic task planning for tool-object manipulation. This approach allows the system to convert the human language sentence into a sequence of feasible motion functions. We have developed a novel manoeuvrability-driven controller using a new tool affordance model derived from visual feedback. This controller helps guide the robot's tool utilization and manipulation actions, even within confined areas, using a stepping incremental approach. The proposed methodology is evaluated with experiments to prove its effectiveness under various manipulation scenarios.

      Role-playing language agents (RPLAs) have emerged as promising applications of large language models (LLMs). However, simulating established characters presents a challenging task for RPLAs, due to the lack of authentic character datasets and nuanced evaluation methods using such data. In this paper, we present CoSER, a collection of a high-quality dataset, open models, and an evaluation protocol towards effective RPLAs of established characters. The CoSER dataset covers 17,966 characters from 771 renowned books. It provides authentic dialogues with real-world intricacies, as well as diverse data types such as conversation setups, character experiences and internal thoughts. Drawing from acting methodology, we introduce given-circumstance acting for training and evaluating role-playing LLMs, where LLMs sequentially portray multiple characters in book scenes. Using our dataset, we develop CoSER 8B and CoSER 70B, i.e., advanced open role-playing LLMs built on LLaMA-3.1 models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the value of the CoSER dataset for RPLA training, evaluation and retrieval. Moreover, CoSER 70B exhibits state-of-the-art performance surpassing or matching GPT-4o on our evaluation and three existing benchmarks, i.e., achieving 75.80% and 93.47% accuracy on the InCharacter and LifeChoice benchmarks respectively.

      Community health workers (CHWs) provide last-mile healthcare services but face challenges due to limited medical knowledge and training. This paper describes the design, deployment, and evaluation of ASHABot, an LLM-powered, experts-in-the-loop, WhatsApp-based chatbot to address the information needs of CHWs in India. Through interviews with CHWs and their supervisors and log analysis, we examine factors affecting their engagement with ASHABot, and ASHABot's role in addressing CHWs' informational needs. We found that ASHABot provided a private channel for CHWs to ask rudimentary and sensitive questions they hesitated to ask supervisors. CHWs trusted the information they received on ASHABot and treated it as an authoritative resource. CHWs' supervisors expanded their knowledge by contributing answers to questions ASHABot failed to answer, but were concerned about demands on their workload and increased accountability. We emphasize positioning LLMs as supplemental fallible resources within the community healthcare ecosystem, instead of as replacements for supervisor support.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Code generation, symbolic math reasoning, and other tasks require LLMs to produce outputs that are both syntactically and semantically correct. Constrained LLM generation is a promising direction to enforce adherence to formal grammar, but prior works have empirically observed that strict enforcement of formal constraints often diminishes the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. In this work, we first provide a theoretical explanation for why constraining LLM outputs to very restrictive grammars that only allow syntactically valid final answers reduces the reasoning capabilities of the model. Second, we demonstrate that by augmenting the output grammar with carefully designed additional rules, it is always possible to preserve the reasoning capabilities of the LLM while ensuring syntactic and semantic correctness in its outputs. Building on these theoretical insights, we propose a reasoning-augmented constrained decoding algorithm, CRANE, which effectively balances the correctness of constrained generation with the flexibility of unconstrained generation. Experiments on multiple open-source LLMs and benchmarks show that CRANE significantly outperforms both state-of-the-art constrained decoding strategies and standard unconstrained decoding, showing up to 10% points accuracy improvement over baselines on challenging symbolic reasoning benchmarks GSM-symbolic and FOLIO.

      This paper investigates data selection and model merging methodologies aimed at incorporating advanced reasoning capabilities such as those of DeepSeek R1 into language-specific large language models (LLMs), with a particular focus on the Thai LLM. Our goal is to enhance the reasoning capabilities of language-specific LLMs while maintaining their target language abilities. DeepSeek R1 excels in reasoning but primarily benefits high-resource languages such as English and Chinese. However, low-resource languages remain underserved due to the dominance of English-centric training data and model optimizations, which limit performance in these languages. This limitation results in unreliable code-switching and diminished effectiveness on tasks in low-resource languages. Meanwhile, local and regional LLM initiatives have attempted to bridge this gap by developing language-specific LLMs that focus on improving local linguistic fidelity. We demonstrate that, with only publicly available datasets and a computational budget of $120, it is possible to enhance the reasoning capabilities of language-specific LLMs to match the level of DeepSeek R1, without compromising their performance on target language tasks.

      LLM cascades are based on the idea that processing all queries with the largest and most expensive LLMs is inefficient. Instead, cascades deploy small LLMs to answer the majority of queries, limiting the use of large and expensive LLMs to only the most difficult queries. This approach can significantly reduce costs without impacting performance. However, risk-sensitive domains such as finance or medicine place an additional premium on avoiding model errors. Recognizing that even the most expensive models may make mistakes, applications in these domains benefit from allowing LLM systems to completely abstain from answering a query when the chance of making a mistake is significant. However, giving a cascade the ability to abstain poses an immediate design question for LLM cascades: should abstention only be allowed at the final model or also at earlier models? Since the error patterns of small and large models are correlated, the latter strategy may further reduce inference costs by letting inexpensive models anticipate abstention decisions by expensive models, thereby obviating the need to run the expensive models. We investigate the benefits of "early abstention" in LLM cascades and find that it reduces the overall test loss by 2.2% on average across six benchmarks (GSM8K, MedMCQA, MMLU, TriviaQA, TruthfulQA, and XSum). These gains result from a more effective use of abstention, which trades a 4.1% average increase in the overall abstention rate for a 13.0% reduction in cost and a 5.0% reduction in error rate. Our findings demonstrate that it is possible to leverage correlations between the error patterns of different language models to drive performance improvements for LLM systems with abstention.

      This paper tackles the problem of video question answering (VideoQA), a task that often requires multi-step reasoning and a profound understanding of spatial-temporal dynamics. While large video-language models perform well on benchmarks, they often lack explainability and spatial-temporal grounding. In this paper, we propose Agent-of-Thoughts Distillation (AoTD), a method that enhances models by incorporating automatically generated Chain-of-Thoughts (CoTs) into the instruction-tuning process. Specifically, we leverage an agent-based system to decompose complex questions into sub-tasks, and address them with specialized vision models, the intermediate results are then treated as reasoning chains. We also introduce a verification mechanism using a large language model (LLM) to ensure the reliability of generated CoTs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AoTD improves the performance on multiple-choice and open-ended benchmarks.

      Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities. However, single-shot inference often yields unreliable results for complex reasoning tasks, leading researchers to explore multiple reasoning paths through methods such as perplexity and self-consistency. In this paper, we present the first theoretical error decomposition analysis of these techniques, breaking down their error into estimation error and model error. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off: perplexity methods suffer from substantial model error due to the absence of a proper consistency function, while self-consistency exhibits high estimation error due to a slow error convergence rate. To overcome these limitations, we propose Reasoning-Pruning Perplexity Consistency (RPC). This approach combines Perplexity Consistency, which seamlessly integrates LLM perplexity with self-consistency, and Reasoning Pruning, which eliminates low-probability reasoning paths to effectively prevent the degeneration of estimation error reduction. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that RPC not only accelerates the convergence rate of estimation error to an exponential level but also holds strong potential for further reducing model error. Extensive empirical evaluations on seven benchmark datasets confirm that RPC can significantly improve reasoning performance, sample efficiency, and confidence reliability.

      Large language models (LLMs), both proprietary and open-source, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various natural language processing tasks. However, they face significant limitations in legal reasoning tasks. Proprietary models introduce data privacy risks and high inference costs, while open-source models underperform due to insufficient legal domain training data. To address these limitations, we study data generation for legal reasoning to improve the legal reasoning performance of open-source LLMs with the help of proprietary LLMs. This is challenging due to the lack of legal knowledge in proprietary LLMs and the difficulty in verifying the generated data. We propose KgDG, a knowledge-guided data generation framework for legal reasoning. Our framework enables leveraging legal knowledge to enhance generation diversity and introduces a refinement and verification process to ensure the quality of generated data. Moreover, we expand the generated dataset to further enhance the LLM reasoning capabilities. Using KgDG, we create a synthetic legal reasoning dataset containing 50K high-quality examples. Our trained model LawGPT outperforms existing legal-specific LLMs and achieves performance comparable to proprietary LLMs, demonstrating the effectiveness of KgDG and LawGPT.

      The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted the challenge of context window limitations, primarily due to the quadratic time complexity of the self-attention mechanism (\(O(N^2)\), where \(N\) denotes the context window length). This constraint impacts tasks such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in question answering (Q\&A) and long context summarization. A common approach involves selecting content with the highest similarity to the query; however, this often leads to redundancy and the exclusion of diverse yet relevant information. Building on principles from Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) and Farthest Point Sampling (FPS), we integrate diversity into the content selection process. Our findings reveal that incorporating diversity substantially increases the recall of selecting relevant sentences or chunks before LLM-based Q\&A and summarization. These results highlight the importance of maintaining diversity in future LLM applications to further improve summarization and Q\&A outcomes.

      We propose a universal adversarial attack on multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) that leverages a single optimized image to override alignment safeguards across diverse queries and even multiple models. By backpropagating through the vision encoder and language head, we craft a synthetic image that forces the model to respond with a targeted phrase (e.g., ''Sure, here it is'') or otherwise unsafe content-even for harmful prompts. In experiments on the SafeBench benchmark, our method achieves significantly higher attack success rates than existing baselines, including text-only universal prompts (e.g., up to 93% on certain models). We further demonstrate cross-model transferability by training on several multimodal LLMs simultaneously and testing on unseen architectures. Additionally, a multi-answer variant of our approach produces more natural-sounding (yet still malicious) responses. These findings underscore critical vulnerabilities in current multimodal alignment and call for more robust adversarial defenses. We will release code and datasets under the Apache-2.0 license.

      A language can have different varieties. These varieties can affect the performance of natural language processing (NLP) models, including large language models (LLMs), which are often trained on data from widely spoken varieties. This paper introduces a novel and cost-effective approach to benchmark model performance across language varieties. We argue that international online review platforms, such as Booking.com, can serve as effective data sources for constructing datasets that capture comments in different language varieties from similar real-world scenarios, like reviews for the same hotel with the same rating using the same language (e.g., Mandarin Chinese) but different language varieties (e.g., Taiwan Mandarin, Mainland Mandarin). To prove this concept, we constructed a contextually aligned dataset comprising reviews in Taiwan Mandarin and Mainland Mandarin and tested six LLMs in a sentiment analysis task. Our results show that LLMs consistently underperform in Taiwan Mandarin.

      The deployment of Large Language Models (LLM) on mobile devices offers significant potential for medical applications, enhancing privacy, security, and cost-efficiency by eliminating reliance on cloud-based services and keeping sensitive health data local. However, the performance and accuracy of on-device LLMs in real-world medical contexts remain underexplored. In this study, we benchmark publicly available on-device LLMs using the AMEGA dataset, evaluating accuracy, computational efficiency, and thermal limitation across various mobile devices. Our results indicate that compact general-purpose models like Phi-3 Mini achieve a strong balance between speed and accuracy, while medically fine-tuned models such as Med42 and Aloe attain the highest accuracy. Notably, deploying LLMs on older devices remains feasible, with memory constraints posing a greater challenge than raw processing power. Our study underscores the potential of on-device LLMs for healthcare while emphasizing the need for more efficient inference and models tailored to real-world clinical reasoning.

      In a systematic way, we investigate a widely asked question: Do LLMs really understand what they say?, which relates to the more familiar term Stochastic Parrot. To this end, we propose a summative assessment over a carefully designed physical concept understanding task, PhysiCo. Our task alleviates the memorization issue via the usage of grid-format inputs that abstractly describe physical phenomena. The grids represents varying levels of understanding, from the core phenomenon, application examples to analogies to other abstract patterns in the grid world. A comprehensive study on our task demonstrates: (1) state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, o1 and Gemini 2.0 flash thinking, lag behind humans by ~40%; (2) the stochastic parrot phenomenon is present in LLMs, as they fail on our grid task but can describe and recognize the same concepts well in natural language; (3) our task challenges the LLMs due to intrinsic difficulties rather than the unfamiliar grid format, as in-context learning and fine-tuning on same formatted data added little to their performance.

      We introduce CopySpec, an innovative technique designed to tackle the inefficiencies LLMs face when generating responses that closely resemble previous outputs. CopySpec identifies repeated sequences in the model's chat history and speculates that the same tokens will follow, enabling seamless copying without compromising output quality or requiring additional GPU memory. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted experiments using five LLMs and five datasets: MT-Bench, CNN/DM, GSM-8K, HumanEval, and our newly created dataset, MT-Redundant. MT-Redundant, introduced in this paper, transforms the second turn of MT-Bench into a request for variations of the first turn's answer, simulating real-world scenarios where users request modifications to prior responses. Our results demonstrate significant speed-ups: up to 2.35x on CNN/DM, 3.08x on the second turn of select MT-Redundant categories, and 2.66x on the third turn of GSM-8K's self-correction tasks. Moreover, we show that CopySpec integrates seamlessly with speculative decoding, yielding an average 49% additional speed-up over speculative decoding for the second turn of MT-Redundant across all eight categories. While LLMs, even with speculative decoding, suffer from slower inference as context sizes grow, CopySpec leverages the expanded context to accelerate inference, making it faster as the context size increases.

By comparing emotion-sensitive and emotion-insensitive LLM-based chatbots across 30 participants, we aim to explore how emotional sensitivity in chatbots influences perceived competence and overall customer satisfaction in service interactions. Additionally, we employ sentiment analysis techniques to analyze and interpret the emotional content of user inputs. We highlight that perceptions of chatbot trustworthiness and competence were higher in the case of the emotion-sensitive chatbot, even if issue resolution rates were not affected. We discuss implications of improved user satisfaction from emotion-sensitive chatbots and potential applications in support services.

      Fact-checking is necessary to address the increasing volume of misinformation. Traditional fact-checking relies on manual analysis to verify claims, but it is slow and resource-intensive. This study establishes baseline comparisons for Automated Fact-Checking (AFC) using Large Language Models (LLMs) across multiple labeling schemes (binary, three-class, five-class) and extends traditional claim verification by incorporating analysis, verdict classification, and explanation in a structured setup to provide comprehensive justifications for real-world claims. We evaluate Llama-3 models of varying sizes (3B, 8B, 70B) on 17,856 claims collected from PolitiFact (2007-2024) using evidence retrieved via restricted web searches. We utilize TIGERScore as a reference-free evaluation metric to score the justifications. Our results show that larger LLMs consistently outperform smaller LLMs in classification accuracy and justification quality without fine-tuning. We find that smaller LLMs in a one-shot scenario provide comparable task performance to fine-tuned Small Language Models (SLMs) with large context sizes, while larger LLMs consistently surpass them. Evidence integration improves performance across all models, with larger LLMs benefiting most. Distinguishing between nuanced labels remains challenging, emphasizing the need for further exploration of labeling schemes and alignment with evidences. Our findings demonstrate the potential of retrieval-augmented AFC with LLMs.

We proposed FineMedLM-o1, which leverages high-quality synthetic medical data and long-form reasoning data for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), enabling advanced dialogue and deep reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we introduced Test-Time Training (TTT) in the medical domain for the first time, facilitating domain adaptation and ensuring reliable, accurate reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that FineMedLM-o1 achieves a 23% average performance improvement over prior models on key medical benchmarks. Furthermore, the introduction of TTT provides an additional 14% performance boost, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing medical reasoning capabilities. To support this process, we also proposed a novel method for synthesizing medical dialogue. Compared to other open-source datasets, our dataset stands out as superior in both quality and complexity.

      The proliferation of misinformation, such as rumors on social media, has drawn significant attention, prompting various expressions of stance among users. Although rumor detection and stance detection are distinct tasks, they can complement each other. Rumors can be identified by cross-referencing stances in related posts, and stances are influenced by the nature of the rumor. However, existing stance detection methods often require post-level stance annotations, which are costly to obtain. We propose a novel LLM-enhanced MIL approach to jointly predict post stance and claim class labels, supervised solely by claim labels, using an undirected microblog propagation model. Our weakly supervised approach relies only on bag-level labels of claim veracity, aligning with multi-instance learning (MIL) principles. To achieve this, we transform the multi-class problem into multiple MIL-based binary classification problems. We then employ a discriminative attention layer to aggregate the outputs from these classifiers into finer-grained classes. Experiments conducted on three rumor datasets and two stance datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, highlighting strong connections between rumor veracity and expressed stances in responding posts. Our method shows promising performance in joint rumor and stance detection compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a range of natural language processing tasks. In particular, improvements in reasoning abilities and the expansion of context windows have opened new avenues for leveraging these powerful models. NL2SQL is challenging in that the natural language question is inherently ambiguous, while the SQL generation requires a precise understanding of complex data schema and semantics. One approach to this semantic ambiguous problem is to provide more and sufficient contextual information. In this work, we explore the performance and the latency trade-offs of the extended context window (a.k.a., long context) offered by Google's state-of-the-art LLM (\textit{gemini-1.5-pro}). We study the impact of various contextual information, including column example values, question and SQL query pairs, user-provided hints, SQL documentation, and schema. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study how the extended context window and extra contextual information can help NL2SQL generation with respect to both accuracy and latency cost. We show that long context LLMs are robust and do not get lost in the extended contextual information. Additionally, our long-context NL2SQL pipeline based on Google's \textit{gemini-pro-1.5} achieve strong performances on various benchmark datasets without finetuning and expensive self-consistency based techniques.

      In the domain of code generation, self-debugging is crucial. It allows LLMs to refine their generated code based on execution feedback. This is particularly important because generating correct solutions in one attempt proves challenging for complex tasks. Prior works on self-debugging mostly focus on prompting methods by providing LLMs with few-shot examples, which work poorly on small open-sourced LLMs. In this work, we propose LeDex, a training framework that significantly improves the self-debugging capability of LLMs. Intuitively, we observe that a chain of explanations on the wrong code followed by code refinement helps LLMs better analyze the wrong code and do refinement. We thus propose an automated pipeline to collect a high-quality dataset for code explanation and refinement by generating a number of explanations and refinement trajectories from the LLM itself or a larger teacher model and filtering via execution verification. We perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and further reinforcement learning (RL) on both success and failure trajectories with a novel reward design considering code explanation and refinement quality. SFT improves the pass@1 by up to 15.92% and pass@10 by 9.30% over four benchmarks. RL training brings additional up to 3.54% improvement on pass@1 and 2.55% improvement on pass@10. The trained LLMs show iterative refinement ability and can keep refining code continuously. Lastly, our human evaluation shows that the LLMs trained with our framework generate more useful code explanations and help developers better understand bugs in source code.

We enable generative CAD Design with LLMs through the introduction of a solver-aided, hierarchical domain specific language (DSL) called AIDL, which offloads the spatial reasoning requirements to a geometric constraint solver. Additionally, we show that in the few-shot regime, AIDL outperforms even a language with in-training data (OpenSCAD), both in terms of generating visual results closer to the prompt and creating objects that are easier to post-process and reason about.

Next, we examine the challenges from various perspectives, including datasets, benchmarking tools, and methodologies.

We investigate the effectiveness of a retrieval-based LLM prompting approach to glossing, applied to the seven languages from the SIGMORPHON 2023 shared task. Our system beats the BERT-based shared task baseline for every language in the morpheme-level score category, and we show that a simple 3-best oracle has higher word-level scores than the challenge winner (a tuned sequence model) in five languages. In a case study on Tsez, we ask the LLM to automatically create and follow linguistic instructions, reducing errors on a confusing grammatical feature.

By focusing on the API-first methodology, this system ensures that microservices are designed with well-defined interfaces, promoting consistency and reliability across the development life-cycle. The integration of log analysis enables the LLM to detect and address issues efficiently, reducing the number of iterations required to produce functional and robust services. This process automates the generation of microservices and also simplifies the debugging and refinement phases, allowing developers to focus on higher-level design and integration tasks. This system has the potential to benefit software developers, architects, and organizations to speed up software development cycles and reducing manual effort. To assess the potential of the system, we conducted surveys with six industry practitioners. After surveying practitioners, the system demonstrated notable advantages in enhancing development speed, automating repetitive tasks, and simplifying the prototyping process.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen widespread applications across various domains due to their growing ability to process diverse types of input data, including text, audio, image and video. While LLMs have demonstrated outstanding performance in understanding and generating contexts for different scenarios, they are vulnerable to prompt-based attacks, which are mostly via text input. In this paper, we introduce the first voice-based jailbreak attack against multimodal LLMs, termed as Flanking Attack, which can process different types of input simultaneously towards the multimodal LLMs. Our work is motivated by recent advancements in monolingual voice-driven large language models, which have introduced new attack surfaces beyond traditional text-based vulnerabilities for LLMs. To investigate these risks, we examine the state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs, which can be accessed via different types of inputs such as audio input, focusing on how adversarial prompts can bypass its defense mechanisms. We propose a novel strategy, in which the disallowed prompt is flanked by benign, narrative-driven prompts. It is integrated in the Flanking Attack which attempts to humanizes the interaction context and execute the attack through a fictional setting. Further, to better evaluate the attack performance, we present a semi-automated self-assessment framework for policy violation detection. We demonstrate that Flanking Attack is capable of manipulating state-of-the-art LLMs into generating misaligned and forbidden outputs, which achieves an average attack success rate ranging from 0.67 to 0.93 across seven forbidden scenarios.

      Integrating large language models (LLMs) into closed-loop robotic task planning has become increasingly popular within embodied artificial intelligence. Previous efforts mainly focused on leveraging the strong reasoning abilities of LLMs to enhance task planning performance while often overlooking task planning efficiency and executability due to repetitive queries to LLMs. This paper addresses the synergy between LLMs and task planning systems, aiming to minimize redundancy while enhancing planning effectiveness. Specifically, building upon Prog-Prompt and the high-level concept of Tree-Planner, we propose Vote-Tree-Planner. This sampling strategy utilizes votes to guide plan traversal during the decision-making process. Our approach is motivated by a straightforward observation: assigning weights to agents during decision-making enables the evaluation of critical paths before execution. With this simple vote-tree construction, our method further improves the success rate and reduces the number of queries to LLMs. The experimental results highlight that our Vote-Tree-Planner demonstrates greater stability and shows a higher average success rate and goal condition recall on the unseen dataset compared with previous baseline methods. These findings underscore the potential of the Vote-Tree-Planner to enhance planning accuracy, reliability, and efficiency in LLM-based planning systems.

This work proposes NestQuant, a novel PTQ scheme for weights and activations that is based on self-similar nested lattices.

We implement a practical low-complexity version of NestQuant based on Gosset lattice, making it a drop-in quantizer for any matrix multiplication step (e.g., in self-attention, MLP etc). For example, NestQuant quantizes weights, KV-cache, and activations of Llama-3-8B to 4 bits, achieving perplexity of 6.6 on wikitext2. This represents more than 55% reduction in perplexity gap with respect to unquantized model (perplexity of 6.14) compared to state-of-the-art Meta's SpinQuant (perplexity 7.3). Comparisons on various LLM evaluation benchmarks also show a reduction in performance degradation induced by quantization.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across various NLP benchmarks. However, excelling in complex tasks that require nuanced reasoning and precise decision-making demands more than raw language proficiency--LLMs must reason, i.e., think logically, draw from past experiences, and synthesize information to reach conclusions and take action. To enhance reasoning abilities, approaches such as prompting and fine-tuning have been widely explored. While these methods have led to clear improvements in reasoning, their impact on LLM safety remains less understood. In this work, we investigate the interplay between reasoning and safety in LLMs. We highlight the latent safety risks that arise as reasoning capabilities improve, shedding light on previously overlooked vulnerabilities. At the same time, we explore how reasoning itself can be leveraged to enhance safety, uncovering potential mitigation strategies. By examining both the risks and opportunities in reasoning-driven LLM safety, our study provides valuable insights for developing models that are not only more capable but also more trustworthy in real-world deployments.

      With a statistical analysis of arXiv paper abstracts, we report a marked drop in the frequency of several words previously identified as overused by ChatGPT, such as "delve", starting soon after they were pointed out in early 2024. The frequency of certain other words favored by ChatGPT, such as "significant", has instead kept increasing. These phenomena suggest that some authors of academic papers have adapted their use of large language models (LLMs), for example, by selecting outputs or applying modifications to the LLM-generated content. Such coevolution and cooperation of humans and LLMs thus introduce additional challenges to the detection of machine-generated text in real-world scenarios. Estimating the impact of LLMs on academic writing by examining word frequency remains feasible, and more attention should be paid to words that were already frequently employed, including those that have decreased in frequency.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as chatbots, yet their ability to personalize responses to user preferences remains limited. We introduce PrefEval, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to infer, memorize and adhere to user preferences in a long-context conversational setting. PrefEval comprises 3,000 manually curated user preference and query pairs spanning 20 topics. PrefEval contains user personalization or preference information in both explicit and implicit forms, and evaluates LLM performance using a generation and a classification task. With PrefEval, we evaluated the aforementioned preference following capabilities of 10 open-source and proprietary LLMs in multi-session conversations with varying context lengths up to 100k tokens. We benchmark with various prompting, iterative feedback, and retrieval-augmented generation methods. Our benchmarking effort reveals that state-of-the-art LLMs face significant challenges in proactively following users' preferences during conversations. In particular, in zero-shot settings, preference following accuracy falls below 10% at merely 10 turns (~3k tokens) across most evaluated models. Even with advanced prompting and retrieval methods, preference following still deteriorates in long-context conversations. Furthermore, we show that fine-tuning on PrefEval significantly improves performance. We believe PrefEval serves as a valuable resource for measuring, understanding, and enhancing LLMs' preference following abilities, paving the way for personalized conversational agents.

      Open-domain dialogue systems have seen remarkable advancements with the development of large language models (LLMs). Nonetheless, most existing dialogue systems predominantly focus on brief single-session interactions, neglecting the real-world demands for long-term companionship and personalized interactions with chatbots. Crucial to addressing this real-world need are event summary and persona management, which enable reasoning for appropriate long-term dialogue responses. Recent progress in the human-like cognitive and reasoning capabilities of LLMs suggests that LLM-based agents could significantly enhance automated perception, decision-making, and problem-solving. In response to this potential, we introduce a model-agnostic framework, the Long-term Dialogue Agent (LD-Agent), which incorporates three independently tunable modules dedicated to event perception, persona extraction, and response generation. For the event memory module, long and short-term memory banks are employed to separately focus on historical and ongoing sessions, while a topic-based retrieval mechanism is introduced to enhance the accuracy of memory retrieval. Furthermore, the persona module conducts dynamic persona modeling for both users and agents. The integration of retrieved memories and extracted personas is subsequently fed into the generator to induce appropriate responses. The effectiveness, generality, and cross-domain capabilities of LD-Agent are empirically demonstrated across various illustrative benchmarks, models, and tasks. The code is released at https://github.com/leolee99/LD-Agent.

      Recent advances in generative AI have precipitated a proliferation of novel writing assistants. These systems typically rely on multilingual large language models (LLMs), providing globalized workers the ability to revise or create diverse forms of content in different languages. However, there is substantial evidence indicating that the performance of multilingual LLMs varies between languages. Users who employ writing assistance for multiple languages are therefore susceptible to disparate output quality. Importantly, recent research has shown that people tend to generalize algorithmic errors across independent tasks, violating the behavioral axiom of choice independence. In this paper, we analyze whether user utilization of novel writing assistants in a charity advertisement writing task is affected by the AI's performance in a second language. Furthermore, we quantify the extent to which these patterns translate into the persuasiveness of generated charity advertisements, as well as the role of peoples' beliefs about LLM utilization in their donation choices. Our results provide evidence that writers who engage with an LLM-based writing assistant violate choice independence, as prior exposure to a Spanish LLM reduces subsequent utilization of an English LLM. While these patterns do not affect the aggregate persuasiveness of the generated advertisements, people's beliefs about the source of an advertisement (human versus AI) do. In particular, Spanish-speaking female participants who believed that they read an AI-generated advertisement strongly adjusted their donation behavior downwards. Furthermore, people are generally not able to adequately differentiate between human-generated and LLM-generated ads. Our work has important implications for the design, development, integration, and adoption of multilingual LLMs as assistive agents -- particularly in writing tasks.

      Books, while often rich in cultural insights, can also mirror societal biases of their eras - biases that Large Language Models (LLMs) may learn and perpetuate during training. We introduce a novel method to trace and quantify these biases using fine-tuned LLMs. We develop BookPAGE, a corpus comprising 593 fictional books across seven decades (1950-2019), to track bias evolution. By fine-tuning LLMs on books from each decade and using targeted prompts, we examine shifts in biases related to gender, sexual orientation, race, and religion. Our findings indicate that LLMs trained on decade-specific books manifest biases reflective of their times, with both gradual trends and notable shifts. For example, model responses showed a progressive increase in the portrayal of women in leadership roles (from 8% to 22%) from the 1950s to 2010s, with a significant uptick in the 1990s (from 4% to 12%), possibly aligning with third-wave feminism. Same-sex relationship references increased markedly from the 1980s to 2000s (from 0% to 10%), mirroring growing LGBTQ+ visibility. Concerningly, negative portrayals of Islam rose sharply in the 2000s (26% to 38%), likely reflecting post-9/11 sentiments. Importantly, we demonstrate that these biases stem mainly from the books' content and not the models' architecture or initial training. Our study offers a new perspective on societal bias trends by bridging AI, literary studies, and social science research.

      Automatic Essay Scoring (AES) assigns scores to student essays, reducing the grading workload for instructors. Developing a scoring system capable of handling essays across diverse prompts is challenging due to the flexibility and diverse nature of the writing task. Existing methods typically fall into two categories: supervised feature-based approaches and large language model (LLM)-based methods. Supervised feature-based approaches often achieve higher performance but require resource-intensive training. In contrast, LLM-based methods are computationally efficient during inference but tend to suffer from lower performance. This paper combines these approaches by incorporating linguistic features into LLM-based scoring. Experimental results show that this hybrid method outperforms baseline models for both in-domain and out-of-domain writing prompts.

      Ontology matching (OM) enables semantic interoperability between different ontologies and resolves their conceptual heterogeneity by aligning related entities. OM systems currently have two prevailing design paradigms: conventional knowledge-based expert systems and newer machine learning-based predictive systems. While large language models (LLMs) and LLM agents have revolutionised data engineering and have been applied creatively in many domains, their potential for OM remains underexplored. This study introduces a novel agent-powered LLM-based design paradigm for OM systems. With consideration of several specific challenges in leveraging LLM agents for OM, we propose a generic framework, namely Agent-OM (Agent for Ontology Matching), consisting of two Siamese agents for retrieval and matching, with a set of OM tools. Our framework is implemented in a proof-of-concept system. Evaluations of three Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) tracks over state-of-the-art OM systems show that our system can achieve results very close to the long-standing best performance on simple OM tasks and can significantly improve the performance on complex and few-shot OM tasks.

      We systematically investigate multi-token prediction (MTP) capabilities within LLMs pre-trained for next-token prediction (NTP). We first show that such models inherently possess MTP capabilities via numerical marginalization over intermediate token probabilities, though performance is data-dependent and improves with model scale. Furthermore, we explore the challenges of integrating MTP heads into frozen LLMs and find that their hidden layers are strongly specialized for NTP, making adaptation non-trivial. Finally, we show that while joint training of MTP heads with the backbone improves performance, it cannot fully overcome this barrier, prompting further research in this direction. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of MTP applied to pretrained LLMs, informing strategies for accelerating inference through parallel token prediction.

      Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities on not just language tasks, but also various tasks that are not linguistic in nature, such as logical reasoning and social inference. In the human brain, neuroscience has identified a core language system that selectively and causally supports language processing. We here ask whether similar specialization for language emerges in LLMs. We identify language-selective units within 18 popular LLMs, using the same localization approach that is used in neuroscience. We then establish the causal role of these units by demonstrating that ablating LLM language-selective units -- but not random units -- leads to drastic deficits in language tasks. Correspondingly, language-selective LLM units are more aligned to brain recordings from the human language system than random units. Finally, we investigate whether our localization method extends to other cognitive domains: while we find specialized networks in some LLMs for reasoning and social capabilities, there are substantial differences among models. These findings provide functional and causal evidence for specialization in large language models, and highlight parallels with the functional organization in the brain.

      Following the milestones in large language models (LLMs) and multimodal models, we have seen a surge in applying LLMs to biochemical tasks. Leveraging graph features and molecular text representations, LLMs can tackle various tasks, such as predicting chemical reaction outcomes and describing molecular properties. However, most current work overlooks the *multi-level nature* of the graph modality, even though different chemistry tasks may benefit from different feature levels. In this work, we first study the effect of feature granularity and reveal that even reducing all GNN-generated feature tokens to a single one does not significantly impact model performance. We then investigate the effect of various graph feature levels and demonstrate that both the quality of LLM-generated molecules and model performance across different tasks depend on different graph feature levels. Therefore, we conclude with two key insights: (1) current molecular-related multimodal LLMs lack a comprehensive understanding of graph features, and (2) static processing is not sufficient for hierarchical graph feature. We share our findings in detail, with the hope of paving the way for the community to develop more advanced multimodal LLMs for incorporating molecular graphs.

Compared to in-house homogeneous GPU clusters, deploying LLMs in cloud environments with diverse types of GPUs is crucial for addressing the GPU shortage problem and being more cost-effective. However, the diversity of network environments and various GPU types on the cloud bring difficulties to achieving high-performance serving. In this work, we propose ThunderServe, a high-performance and cost-efficient LLM serving system for heterogeneous cloud environments. We introduce a novel scheduling algorithm, which optimizes the deployment plan of LLM serving to accommodate the heterogeneous resource and network bandwidth conditions in cloud environments. Furthermore, we propose a lightweight re-scheduling mechanism, designed to adapt to fluctuating online conditions (e.g., node failures, workload shifts) without the need for costly restarts of ongoing services. Empirical results in both heterogeneous cloud and homogeneous in-house environments reveal that ThunderServe delivers up to a 2.1$\times$ and on average a $1.7\times$ increase in throughput and achieves up to a 2.5$\times$ and on average a $1.5\times$ reduction in latency deadlines compared with state-of-the-art systems given the same price budget, suggesting opting for cloud services provides a more cost-efficient solution.

      Despite advances in the multilingual capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) across diverse tasks, English remains the dominant language for LLM research and development. So, when working with a different language, this has led to the widespread practice of pre-translation, i.e., translating the task prompt into English before inference. Selective pre-translation, a more surgical approach, focuses on translating specific prompt components. However, its current use is sporagic and lacks a systematic research foundation. Consequently, the optimal pre-translation strategy for various multilingual settings and tasks remains unclear. In this work, we aim to uncover the optimal setup for pre-translation by systematically assessing its use. Specifically, we view the prompt as a modular entity, composed of four functional parts: instruction, context, examples, and output, either of which could be translated or not. We evaluate pre-translation strategies across 35 languages covering both low and high-resource languages, on various tasks including Question Answering (QA), Natural Language Inference (NLI), Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Abstractive Summarization. Our experiments show the impact of factors as similarity to English, translation quality and the size of pre-trained data, on the model performance with pre-translation. We suggest practical guidelines for choosing optimal strategies in various multilingual settings.

      The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various domains has led researchers to apply them to graph-related problems by converting graph data into natural language text. However, unlike graph data, natural language inherently has sequential order. We observe a counter-intuitive fact that when the order of nodes or edges in the natural language description of a graph is shuffled, despite describing the same graph, model performance fluctuates between high performance and random guessing. Additionally, due to LLMs' limited input context length, current methods typically randomly sample neighbors of target nodes as representatives of their neighborhood, which may not always be effective for accurate reasoning. To address these gaps, we introduce GraphSOS (Graph Sampling and Order Selection). This novel model framework features an Order Selector Module to ensure proper serialization order of the graph and a Subgraph Sampling Module to sample subgraphs with better structure for better reasoning. Furthermore, we propose Graph CoT obtained through distillation, and enhance LLM's reasoning and zero-shot learning capabilities for graph tasks through instruction tuning. Experiments on multiple datasets for node classification and graph question-answering demonstrate that GraphSOS improves LLMs' performance and generalization ability on graph tasks.

      Uncertainty estimation (UE) of generative large language models (LLMs) is crucial for evaluating the reliability of generated sequences. A significant subset of UE methods utilize token probabilities to assess uncertainty, aggregating multiple token probabilities into a single UE score using a scoring function. Existing scoring functions for probability-based UE, such as length-normalized scoring and semantic contribution-based weighting, are designed to solve certain aspects of the problem but exhibit limitations, including the inability to handle biased probabilities and complex semantic dependencies between tokens. To address these issues, in this work, we propose Learnable Response Scoring (LARS) function, a novel scoring function that leverages supervised data to capture complex dependencies between tokens and probabilities, thereby producing more reliable and calibrated response scores in computing the uncertainty of LLM generations. Our comprehensive experiments across question-answering and arithmetical reasoning tasks with various datasets demonstrate that LARS significantly outperforms existing scoring functions, achieving improvements of up to 16\% AUROC score.

      Watermarking has emerged as a crucial method to distinguish AI-generated text from human-created text. In this paper, we present a novel theoretical framework for watermarking Large Language Models (LLMs) that jointly optimizes both the watermarking scheme and the detection process. Our approach focuses on maximizing detection performance while maintaining control over the worst-case Type-I error and text distortion. We characterize \emph{the universally minimum Type-II error}, showing a fundamental trade-off between watermark detectability and text distortion. Importantly, we identify that the optimal watermarking schemes are adaptive to the LLM generative distribution. Building on our theoretical insights, we propose an efficient, model-agnostic, distribution-adaptive watermarking algorithm, utilizing a surrogate model alongside the Gumbel-max trick. Experiments conducted on Llama2-13B and Mistral-8$\times$7B models confirm the effectiveness of our approach. Additionally, we examine incorporating robustness into our framework, paving a way to future watermarking systems that withstand adversarial attacks more effectively.

      Large language models' significant advances in capabilities are accompanied by significant increases in inference costs. Model routing is a simple technique for reducing inference cost, wherein one maintains a pool of candidate LLMs, and learns to route each prompt to the smallest feasible LLM. Existing works focus on learning a router for a fixed pool of LLMs. In this paper, we consider the problem of dynamic routing, where new, previously unobserved LLMs are available at test time. We propose a new approach to this problem that relies on representing each LLM as a feature vector, derived based on predictions on a set of representative prompts. Based on this, we detail two effective strategies, relying on cluster-based routing and a learned cluster map respectively. We prove that these strategies are estimates of a theoretically optimal routing rule, and provide an excess risk bound to quantify their errors. Experiments on a range of public benchmarks show the effectiveness of the proposed strategies in routing amongst more than 30 unseen LLMs.

      Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enhances mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs) by enabling detailed step-by-step solutions. However, due to the verbosity of LLMs, the resulting reasoning chains can be long, making it harder to verify the reasoning steps and trace issues resulting from dependencies between the steps that may be farther away in the sequence of steps. Importantly, mathematical reasoning allows each step to be derived from a small set of premises, which are a subset of the preceding steps in the reasoning chain. In this paper, we present a framework that identifies the premises for each step, to improve the evaluation of reasoning. We restructure conventional linear reasoning chains into Premise Augmented Reasoning Chains (PARC) by introducing premise links, resulting in a directed acyclic graph where the nodes are the steps and the edges are the premise links. Through experiments with a PARC-based dataset that we built, namely PERL (Premises and ERrors identification in LLMs), we demonstrate that LLMs can reliably identify premises within complex reasoning chains. In particular, even open-source LLMs achieve 90% recall in premise identification. We also show that PARC helps to identify errors in reasoning chains more reliably. The accuracy of error identification improves by 6% to 16% absolute when step-by-step verification is carried out in PARC under the premises. Our findings highlight the utility of premise-centric representations in addressing complex problem-solving tasks and open new avenues for improving the reliability of LLM-based reasoning evaluations.

      Developing web-based GIS applications, commonly known as CyberGIS dashboards, for querying and visualizing GIS data in environmental research often demands repetitive and resource-intensive efforts. While Generative AI offers automation potential for code generation, it struggles with complex scientific applications due to challenges in integrating domain knowledge, software engineering principles, and UI design best practices. This paper introduces a knowledge-augmented code generation framework that retrieves software engineering best practices, domain expertise, and advanced technology stacks from a specialized knowledge base to enhance Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) for front-end development. The framework automates the creation of GIS-based web applications (e.g., dashboards, interfaces) from user-defined UI wireframes sketched in tools like PowerPoint or Adobe Illustrator. A novel Context-Aware Visual Prompting method, implemented in Python, extracts layouts and interface features from these wireframes to guide code generation. Our approach leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate front-end code by integrating structured reasoning, software engineering principles, and domain knowledge, drawing inspiration from Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). A case study demonstrates the framework's capability to generate a modular, maintainable web platform hosting multiple dashboards for visualizing environmental and energy data (e.g., time-series, shapefiles, rasters) from user-sketched wireframes. By employing a knowledge-driven approach, the framework produces scalable, industry-standard front-end code using design patterns such as Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) and frameworks like React. This significantly reduces manual effort in design and coding, pioneering an automated and efficient method for developing smart city software.

      Understanding human behavior and society is a central focus in social sciences, with the rise of generative social science marking a significant paradigmatic shift. By leveraging bottom-up simulations, it replaces costly and logistically challenging traditional experiments with scalable, replicable, and systematic computational approaches for studying complex social dynamics. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have further transformed this research paradigm, enabling the creation of human-like generative social agents and realistic simulacra of society. In this paper, we propose AgentSociety, a large-scale social simulator that integrates LLM-driven agents, a realistic societal environment, and a powerful large-scale simulation engine. Based on the proposed simulator, we generate social lives for over 10k agents, simulating their 5 million interactions both among agents and between agents and their environment. Furthermore, we explore the potential of AgentSociety as a testbed for computational social experiments, focusing on four key social issues: polarization, the spread of inflammatory messages, the effects of universal basic income policies, and the impact of external shocks such as hurricanes. These four issues serve as valuable cases for assessing AgentSociety's support for typical research methods -- such as surveys, interviews, and interventions -- as well as for investigating the patterns, causes, and underlying mechanisms of social issues. The alignment between AgentSociety's outcomes and real-world experimental results not only demonstrates its ability to capture human behaviors and their underlying mechanisms, but also underscores its potential as an important platform for social scientists and policymakers.

We also propose a mini-batch variant, enabling efficient online clustering for streaming text data and providing real-time interpretability of evolving cluster centroids.

Finetuning the model results in reducing the sensitivity of the model output to the lexical input variations. This is then applied to a classification problem and a probabilistic method is proposed for estimating the certainties of the predicted classes.

      Existing methods for simulating individual identities often oversimplify human complexity, which may lead to incomplete or flattened representations. To address this, we introduce SPeCtrum, a grounded framework for constructing authentic LLM agent personas by incorporating an individual's multidimensional self-concept. SPeCtrum integrates three core components: Social Identity (S), Personal Identity (P), and Personal Life Context (C), each contributing distinct yet interconnected aspects of identity. To evaluate SPeCtrum's effectiveness in identity representation, we conducted automated and human evaluations. Automated evaluations using popular drama characters showed that Personal Life Context (C)-derived from short essays on preferences and daily routines-modeled characters' identities more effectively than Social Identity (S) and Personal Identity (P) alone and performed comparably to the full SPC combination. In contrast, human evaluations involving real-world individuals found that the full SPC combination provided a more comprehensive self-concept representation than C alone. Our findings suggest that while C alone may suffice for basic identity simulation, integrating S, P, and C enhances the authenticity and accuracy of real-world identity representation. Overall, SPeCtrum offers a structured approach for simulating individuals in LLM agents, enabling more personalized human-AI interactions and improving the realism of simulation-based behavioral studies.

      A high volume of recent ML security literature focuses on attacks against aligned large language models (LLMs). These attacks may extract private information or coerce the model into producing harmful outputs. In real-world deployments, LLMs are often part of a larger agentic pipeline including memory systems, retrieval, web access, and API calling. Such additional components introduce vulnerabilities that make these LLM-powered agents much easier to attack than isolated LLMs, yet relatively little work focuses on the security of LLM agents. In this paper, we analyze security and privacy vulnerabilities that are unique to LLM agents. We first provide a taxonomy of attacks categorized by threat actors, objectives, entry points, attacker observability, attack strategies, and inherent vulnerabilities of agent pipelines. We then conduct a series of illustrative attacks on popular open-source and commercial agents, demonstrating the immediate practical implications of their vulnerabilities. Notably, our attacks are trivial to implement and require no understanding of machine learning.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      The next frontier of online advertising is revenue generation from LLM-generated content. We consider a setting where advertisers aim to influence the responses of an LLM to align with their interests, while platforms seek to maximize advertiser value and ensure user satisfaction. The challenge is that advertisers' preferences generally conflict with those of the user, and advertisers may misreport their preferences. To address this, we introduce MOSAIC, an auction mechanism that ensures that truthful reporting is a dominant strategy for advertisers and that aligns the utility of each advertiser with their contribution to social welfare. Importantly, the mechanism operates without LLM fine-tuning or access to model weights and provably converges to the output of the optimally fine-tuned LLM as computational resources increase. Additionally, it can incorporate contextual information about advertisers, which significantly improves social welfare. Through experiments with a publicly available LLM, we show that MOSAIC leads to high advertiser value and platform revenue with low computational overhead. While our motivating application is online advertising, our mechanism can be applied in any setting with monetary transfers, making it a general-purpose solution for truthfully aggregating the preferences of self-interested agents over LLM-generated replies.

      Learning from mistakes is a fundamental feature of human intelligence. Previous work has shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) can also learn from incorrect answers when provided with a comprehensive rationale detailing why an answer is wrong or how to correct it. In this work, we examine whether LLMs can learn from mistakes in mathematical reasoning tasks when these explanations are not provided. We investigate if LLMs are able to implicitly infer such rationales simply from observing both incorrect and correct answers. Surprisingly, we find that LLMs perform better, on average, when rationales are eliminated from the context and incorrect answers are simply shown alongside correct ones. This approach also substantially outperforms chain-of-thought prompting in our evaluations. We show that these results are consistent across LLMs of different sizes and varying reasoning abilities. Further, we carry out an in-depth analysis, and show that prompting with both wrong and correct answers leads to greater performance and better generalisation than introducing additional, more diverse question-answer pairs into the context. Finally, we show that new rationales generated by models that have only observed incorrect and correct answers are scored equally as highly by humans as those produced with the aid of exemplar rationales. Our results demonstrate that LLMs are indeed capable of in-context implicit learning.

      This study examines how temperature settings and model architectures affect the generation of structured fictional data (names, birthdates) across three large language models (LLMs): llama3.1:8b, deepseek-r1:8b, and mistral:latest. By systematically testing temperature values from 0.0 to 1.0 in increments of 0.1, we conducted 330 trials yielding 889 structured entities, validated for syntactic consistency. Key findings reveal that model architecture significantly influences computational efficiency, with mistral:latest and llama3.1:8b processing data 8x faster than deepseek-r1:8b. Contrary to expectations, temperature showed no correlation with processing time, challenging assumptions about stochastic sampling costs. Output diversity remained limited, as models consistently defaulted to common name archetypes (e.g., 'John Doe' and 'Jane Smith') across all temperatures, though rare names clustered at intermediate values (0.3-0.7). These results demonstrate that architectural optimizations, rather than temperature adjustments, dominate performance in structured generation tasks. The findings emphasize prioritizing model selection over hyperparameter tuning for efficiency and suggest explicit diversity constraints are necessary to mitigate default output biases in synthetic data pipelines.

      Large language models (LLMs) are helping millions of users write texts about diverse issues, and in doing so expose users to different ideas and perspectives. This creates concerns about issue bias, where an LLM tends to present just one perspective on a given issue, which in turn may influence how users think about this issue. So far, it has not been possible to measure which issue biases LLMs actually manifest in real user interactions, making it difficult to address the risks from biased LLMs. Therefore, we create IssueBench: a set of 2.49m realistic prompts for measuring issue bias in LLM writing assistance, which we construct based on 3.9k templates (e.g. "write a blog about") and 212 political issues (e.g. "AI regulation") from real user interactions. Using IssueBench, we show that issue biases are common and persistent in state-of-the-art LLMs. We also show that biases are remarkably similar across models, and that all models align more with US Democrat than Republican voter opinion on a subset of issues. IssueBench can easily be adapted to include other issues, templates, or tasks. By enabling robust and realistic measurement, we hope that IssueBench can bring a new quality of evidence to ongoing discussions about LLM biases and how to address them.

      The powerfulness of LLMs indicates that deploying various LLMs with different scales and architectures on end, edge, and cloud to satisfy different requirements and adaptive heterogeneous hardware is the critical way to achieve ubiquitous intelligence for 6G. However, the massive parameter scale of LLMs poses significant challenges in deploying them on edge devices due to high computational and storage demands. Considering that the sparse activation in Mixture of Experts (MoE) is effective on scalable and dynamic allocation of computational and communications resources at the edge, this paper proposes a novel MoE-empowered collaborative deployment framework for edge LLMs, denoted as CoEL. This framework fully leverages the properties of MoE architecture and encompasses four key aspects: Perception, Deployment, Compression, and Updating. Edge servers broadcast their resource status and the specific resource requirements of LLMs to their neighbors. Then, utilizing this data, two sophisticated deployment strategies are proposed for satisfying varying model scales, ensuring that each model is deployed effectively. One for deploying LLMs on a single edge device through intra-device resource collaboration, and another for a distributed deployment across multiple edge devices via inter-device resource collaboration. Furthermore, both the models and the intermediate data are compressed for reducing memory footprint by quantization and reducing the volume of intermediate data by token fusion and pruning. Finally, given the dynamic of network topology, resource status, and user requirements, the deployment strategies are regularly updated to maintain its relevance and effectiveness. This paper also delineates the challenges and potential research directions for the deployment of edge LLMs.

      The development of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns about potential misuse. One practical solution is to embed a watermark in the text, allowing ownership verification through watermark extraction. Existing methods primarily focus on defending against modification attacks, often neglecting other spoofing attacks. For example, attackers can alter the watermarked text to produce harmful content without compromising the presence of the watermark, which could lead to false attribution of this malicious content to the LLM. This situation poses a serious threat to the LLMs service providers and highlights the significance of achieving modification detection and generated-text detection simultaneously. Therefore, we propose a technique to detect modifications in text for unbiased watermark which is sensitive to modification. We introduce a new metric called ``discarded tokens", which measures the number of tokens not included in watermark detection. When a modification occurs, this metric changes and can serve as evidence of the modification. Additionally, we improve the watermark detection process and introduce a novel method for unbiased watermark. Our experiments demonstrate that we can achieve effective dual detection capabilities: modification detection and generated-text detection by watermark.

By simulating complex human interactions, it assesses how LLMs interpret and align with human thought patterns during conversational exchanges, which are essential for effective social partnerships in HCI. Initial findings highlight the influence of model sophistication on performance, offering insights into the models capabilities to engage in meaningful social interactions and adapt behaviors in human-like ways. This research advances the understanding of LLMs potential to replicate or diverge from human cognitive functions, paving the way for more nuanced and empathetic human-machine collaborations.

      The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into optimization has created a powerful synergy, opening exciting research opportunities. This paper investigates how LLMs can enhance existing optimization algorithms. Using their pre-trained knowledge, we demonstrate their ability to propose innovative heuristic variations and implementation strategies. To evaluate this, we applied a non-trivial optimization algorithm, Construct, Merge, Solve and Adapt (CMSA) -- a hybrid metaheuristic for combinatorial optimization problems that incorporates a heuristic in the solution construction phase. Our results show that an alternative heuristic proposed by GPT-4o outperforms the expert-designed heuristic of CMSA, with the performance gap widening on larger and denser graphs.

      LLMs have boosted progress in many AI applications. Recently, there were attempts to distill the vast knowledge of LLMs into information retrieval systems. Those distillation methods mostly use output probabilities of LLMs which are unavailable in the latest black-box LLMs. We propose Syntriever, a training framework for retrievers using synthetic data from black-box LLMs. Syntriever consists of two stages. Firstly in the distillation stage, we synthesize relevant and plausibly irrelevant passages and augmented queries using chain-of-thoughts for the given queries. LLM is asked to self-verify the synthetic data for possible hallucinations, after which retrievers are trained with a loss designed to cluster the embeddings of relevant passages. Secondly in the alignment stage, we align the retriever with the preferences of LLMs. We propose a preference modeling called partial Plackett-Luce ranking to learn LLM preferences with regularization which prevents the model from deviating excessively from that trained in the distillation stage. Experiments show that Syntriever achieves state-of-the-art performances on benchmark datasets from various domains in nDCG@$K$.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in recent years, owing to their impressive generalization capabilities and rich world knowledge. To capitalize on the potential of using LLMs as recommender systems, mainstream approaches typically focus on two paradigms. The first paradigm designs multi-domain or multi-task instruction data for generalizable recommendation, so as to align LLMs with general recommendation areas and deal with cold-start recommendation. The second paradigm enhances domain-specific recommendation tasks with parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, in order to improve models under the warm recommendation scenarios. While most previous works treat these two paradigms separately, we argue that they have complementary advantages, and combining them together would be helpful. To that end, in this paper, we propose a generalizable and efficient LLM-based recommendation framework MoLoRec. Our approach starts by parameter-efficient fine-tuning a domain-general module with general recommendation instruction data, to align LLM with recommendation knowledge. Then, given users' behavior of a specific domain, we construct a domain-specific instruction dataset and apply efficient fine-tuning to the pre-trained LLM. After that, we provide approaches to integrate the above domain-general part and domain-specific part with parameters mixture. Please note that, MoLoRec is efficient with plug and play, as the domain-general module is trained only once, and any domain-specific plug-in can be efficiently merged with only domain-specific fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets under both warm and cold-start recommendation scenarios validate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed MoLoRec.

      In the realm of microservices architecture, the occurrence of frequent incidents necessitates the employment of Root Cause Analysis (RCA) for swift issue resolution. It is common that a serious incident can take several domain experts hours to identify the root cause. Consequently, a contemporary trend involves harnessing Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated agents for RCA. Though the recent ReAct framework aligns well with the Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) for its thought-action-observation paradigm, its hallucinations often lead to irrelevant actions and directly affect subsequent results. Additionally, the complex and variable clues of the incident can overwhelm the model one step further. To confront these challenges, we propose Flow-of-Action, a pioneering Standard Operation Procedure (SOP) enhanced LLM-based multi-agent system. By explicitly summarizing the diagnosis steps of SREs, SOP imposes constraints on LLMs at crucial junctures, guiding the RCA process towards the correct trajectory. To facilitate the rational and effective utilization of SOPs, we design an SOP-centric framework called SOP flow. SOP flow contains a series of tools, including one for finding relevant SOPs for incidents, another for automatically generating SOPs for incidents without relevant ones, and a tool for converting SOPs into code. This significantly alleviates the hallucination issues of ReAct in RCA tasks. We also design multiple auxiliary agents to assist the main agent by removing useless noise, narrowing the search space, and informing the main agent whether the RCA procedure can stop. Compared to the ReAct method's 35.50% accuracy, our Flow-of-Action method achieves 64.01%, meeting the accuracy requirements for RCA in real-world systems.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Open-ended learning agents must efficiently prioritize goals in vast possibility spaces, focusing on those that maximize learning progress (LP). When such autotelic exploration is achieved by LLM agents trained with online RL in high-dimensional and evolving goal spaces, a key challenge for LP prediction is modeling one's own competence, a form of metacognitive monitoring. Traditional approaches either require extensive sampling or rely on brittle expert-defined goal groupings. We introduce MAGELLAN, a metacognitive framework that lets LLM agents learn to predict their competence and LP online. By capturing semantic relationships between goals, MAGELLAN enables sample-efficient LP estimation and dynamic adaptation to evolving goal spaces through generalization. In an interactive learning environment, we show that MAGELLAN improves LP prediction efficiency and goal prioritization, being the only method allowing the agent to fully master a large and evolving goal space. These results demonstrate how augmenting LLM agents with a metacognitive ability for LP predictions can effectively scale curriculum learning to open-ended goal spaces.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization capabilities across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, they exhibit notable weaknesses in character-level string manipulation, struggling with fundamental operations such as character deletion, insertion, and substitution. These challenges stem primarily from tokenization constraints, despite the critical role of such operations in data preprocessing and code generation. Through systematic analysis, we derive two key insights: (1) LLMs face significant difficulties in leveraging intrinsic token knowledge for character-level reasoning, and (2) atomized word structures can substantially enhance LLMs' ability to process token-level structural information. Building on these insights, we propose Character-Level Manipulation via Divide and Conquer, a novel approach designed to bridge the gap between token-level processing and character-level manipulation. Our method decomposes complex operations into explicit character-level subtasks coupled with controlled token reconstruction phases, leading to significant improvements in accuracy. Without additional training, our method significantly improves accuracies on the $\texttt{Deletion}$, $\texttt{Insertion}$, and $\texttt{Substitution}$ tasks. To support further research, we open-source our implementation and benchmarks.

      Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in educational, clinical, and professional settings, but their tendency for sycophancy -- prioritizing user agreement over independent reasoning -- poses risks to reliability. This study introduces a framework to evaluate sycophantic behavior in ChatGPT-4o, Claude-Sonnet, and Gemini-1.5-Pro across AMPS (mathematics) and MedQuad (medical advice) datasets. Sycophantic behavior was observed in 58.19% of cases, with Gemini exhibiting the highest rate (62.47%) and ChatGPT the lowest (56.71%). Progressive sycophancy, leading to correct answers, occurred in 43.52% of cases, while regressive sycophancy, leading to incorrect answers, was observed in 14.66%. Preemptive rebuttals demonstrated significantly higher sycophancy rates than in-context rebuttals (61.75% vs. 56.52%, $Z=5.87$, $p<0.001$), particularly in computational tasks, where regressive sycophancy increased significantly (preemptive: 8.13%, in-context: 3.54%, $p<0.001$). Simple rebuttals maximized progressive sycophancy ($Z=6.59$, $p<0.001$), while citation-based rebuttals exhibited the highest regressive rates ($Z=6.59$, $p<0.001$). Sycophantic behavior showed high persistence (78.5%, 95% CI: [77.2%, 79.8%]) regardless of context or model. These findings emphasize the risks and opportunities of deploying LLMs in structured and dynamic domains, offering insights into prompt programming and model optimization for safer AI applications.

      The wide deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) has given rise to strong demands for optimizing their inference performance. Today's techniques serving this purpose primarily focus on reducing latency and improving throughput through algorithmic and hardware enhancements, while largely overlooking their privacy side effects, particularly in a multi-user environment. In our research, for the first time, we discovered a set of new timing side channels in LLM systems, arising from shared caches and GPU memory allocations, which can be exploited to infer both confidential system prompts and those issued by other users. These vulnerabilities echo security challenges observed in traditional computing systems, highlighting an urgent need to address potential information leakage in LLM serving infrastructures. In this paper, we report novel attack strategies designed to exploit such timing side channels inherent in LLM deployments, specifically targeting the Key-Value (KV) cache and semantic cache widely used to enhance LLM inference performance. Our approach leverages timing measurements and classification models to detect cache hits, allowing an adversary to infer private prompts with high accuracy. We also propose a token-by-token search algorithm to efficiently recover shared prompt prefixes in the caches, showing the feasibility of stealing system prompts and those produced by peer users. Our experimental studies on black-box testing of popular online LLM services demonstrate that such privacy risks are completely realistic, with significant consequences. Our findings underscore the need for robust mitigation to protect LLM systems against such emerging threats.

      Training and fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with hundreds of billions to trillions of parameters requires tens of thousands of GPUs, and a highly scalable software stack. In this work, we present a novel four-dimensional hybrid parallel algorithm implemented in a highly scalable, portable, open-source framework called AxoNN. We describe several performance optimizations in AxoNN to improve matrix multiply kernel performance, overlap non-blocking collectives with computation, and performance modeling to choose performance optimal configurations. These have resulted in unprecedented scaling and peak flop/s (bf16) for training of GPT-style transformer models on Perlmutter (620.1 Petaflop/s), Frontier (1.381 Exaflop/s) and Alps (1.423 Exaflop/s). While the abilities of LLMs improve with the number of trainable parameters, so do privacy and copyright risks caused by memorization of training data, which can cause disclosure of sensitive or private information at inference time. We highlight this side effect of scale through experiments that explore "catastrophic memorization", where models are sufficiently large to memorize training data in a single pass, and present an approach to prevent it. As part of this study, we demonstrate fine-tuning of a 405-billion parameter LLM using AxoNN on Frontier.

However, a standardized dataset to benchmark the agent capabilities of LLMs in medical applications is currently lacking, making the evaluation of LLMs on complex tasks in interactive healthcare environments challenging. To address this gap, we introduce MedAgentBench, a broad evaluation suite designed to assess the agent capabilities of large language models within medical records contexts. MedAgentBench encompasses 300 patient-specific clinically-derived tasks from 10 categories written by human physicians, realistic profiles of 100 patients with over 700,000 data elements, a FHIR-compliant interactive environment, and an accompanying codebase. The environment uses the standard APIs and communication infrastructure used in modern EMR systems, so it can be easily migrated into live EMR systems. MedAgentBench presents an unsaturated agent-oriented benchmark that current state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit some ability to succeed at. The best model (Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2) achieves a success rate of 69.67%. However, there is still substantial space for improvement which gives the community a next direction to optimize. Furthermore, there is significant variation in performance across task categories.

      Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promising improvements, often surpassing existing methods across a wide range of downstream tasks in natural language processing. However, these models still face challenges, which may hinder their practical applicability. For example, the phenomenon of hallucination is known to compromise the reliability of LLMs, especially in fields that demand high factual precision. Current benchmarks primarily focus on hallucination detection and factuality evaluation but do not extend beyond identification. This paper proposes an explanation enhanced hallucination-detection model, coined as HuDEx, aimed at enhancing the reliability of LLM-generated responses by both detecting hallucinations and providing detailed explanations. The proposed model provides a novel approach to integrate detection with explanations, and enable both users and the LLM itself to understand and reduce errors. Our measurement results demonstrate that the proposed model surpasses larger LLMs, such as Llama3 70B and GPT-4, in hallucination detection accuracy, while maintaining reliable explanations. Furthermore, the proposed model performs well in both zero-shot and other test environments, showcasing its adaptability across diverse benchmark datasets. The proposed approach further enhances the hallucination detection research by introducing a novel approach to integrating interpretability with hallucination detection, which further enhances the performance and reliability of evaluating hallucinations in language models.
