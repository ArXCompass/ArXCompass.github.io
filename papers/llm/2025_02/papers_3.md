      Modern recommender systems use ML models to predict consumer preferences from consumption history. Although these "black-box" models achieve impressive predictive performance, they often suffer from a lack of transparency and explainability. Contrary to the presumed tradeoff between explainability and accuracy, we show that integrating large language models (LLMs) with deep neural networks (DNNs) can improve both. We propose LR-Recsys, which augments DNN-based systems with LLM reasoning capabilities. LR-Recsys introduces a contrastive-explanation generator that produces human-readable positive explanations and negative explanations. These explanations are embedded via a fine-tuned autoencoder and combined with consumer and product features to improve predictions. Beyond offering explainability, we show that LR-Recsys also improves learning efficiency and predictive accuracy, as supported by high-dimensional, multi-environment statistical learning theory. LR-Recsys outperforms state-of-the-art recommender systems by 3-14% on three real-world datasets. Importantly, our analysis reveals that these gains primarily derive from LLMs' reasoning capabilities rather than their external domain knowledge. LR-RecSys presents an effective approach to combine LLMs with traditional DNNs, two of the most widely used ML models today. The explanations generated by LR-Recsys provide actionable insights for consumers, sellers, and platforms, helping to build trust, optimize product offerings, and inform targeting strategies.

      The rapid development of the Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) in recent years has been closely linked to their ever-growing and already enormous sizes. Many LLMs contain hundreds of billions of parameters and require dedicated hardware resources for training and inference. One of the key challenges inherent to the Transformer architecture is the requirement to support numerous non-linear transformations that involves normalization. For instance, each decoder block typically contains at least one Softmax operation and two Layernorms. The computation of the corresponding normalization scaling factors becomes a major bottleneck as it requires spatial collective operations. In other words, when it comes to the computation of denominators for Softmax and Layernorm, all vector elements must be aggregated into a single location, requiring significant communication. These collective operations slow down inference on Transformers by approximately 20%, defeating the whole purpose of distributed in-memory compute. In this work, we propose an extremely efficient technique that can completely hide the overhead caused by such collective operations. Note that each Softmax and Layernorm operation is typically followed by a linear layer. Since non-linear and linear operations are performed on different hardware engines, they can be easily parallelized once the algebra allows such commutation. By leveraging the inherent properties of linear operations, we can defer the normalization of the preceding Softmax and Layernorm until after the linear layer is computed. Now we can compute the collective scaling factors concurrently with the matrix multiplication and completely hide the latency of the former behind the latter. Such parallelization preserves the numerical accuracy while significantly improving the hardware utilization and reducing the overall latency.

      Evacuation decision prediction is critical for efficient and effective wildfire response by helping emergency management anticipate traffic congestion and bottlenecks, allocate resources, and minimize negative impacts. Traditional statistical methods for evacuation decision prediction fail to capture the complex and diverse behavioral logic of different individuals. In this work, for the first time, we introduce FLARE, short for facilitating LLM for advanced reasoning on wildfire evacuation decision prediction, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based framework that integrates behavioral theories and models to streamline the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and subsequently integrate with memory-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) module to provide accurate evacuation decision prediction and understanding. Our proposed method addresses the limitations of using existing LLMs for evacuation behavioral predictions, such as limited survey data, mismatching with behavioral theory, conflicting individual preferences, implicit and complex mental states, and intractable mental state-behavior mapping. Experiments on three post-wildfire survey datasets show an average of 20.47% performance improvement over traditional theory-informed behavioral models, with strong cross-event generalizability.

      Benchmarks are critical for measuring Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning capabilities. Some benchmarks have even become the de facto indicator of such capabilities. However, as LLM reasoning capabilities improve, existing widely-used benchmarks such as GSM8K marginally encapsulate model reasoning differentials - most state-of-the-art models for example achieve over 94% accuracy on the GSM8K dataset (paperwithcode, 2024). While constructing harder benchmarks is possible, their creation is often manual, expensive, and unscalable. As such, we present Scheherazade, an automated approach to produce large quantities of challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks by logically chaining a small starting set of problems. We propose two different chaining methods, forward chaining and backward chaining, which include randomized branching techniques to generate complex reasoning problems. We apply Scheherazade on GSM8K to create GSM8K-Scheherazade and evaluate 3 frontier LLMs and OpenAI's o1-preview on it. We show that while other frontier models' performance declines precipitously at only a few questions chained, our evaluation suggests o1-preview's performance persists, with the flagship OpenAI model the only one to perform better at backward reasoning.

      Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized for machine translation, yet their predictions often exhibit uncertainties that hinder interpretability and user trust. Effectively visualizing these uncertainties can enhance the usability of LLM outputs, particularly in contexts where translation accuracy is critical. This paper addresses two primary objectives: (1) providing users with token-level insights into model confidence and (2) developing a web-based visualization tool to quantify and represent translation uncertainties. To achieve these goals, we utilized the T5 model with the WMT19 dataset for translation tasks and evaluated translation quality using established metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE. We introduced three novel uncertainty quantification (UQ) metrics: (1) the geometric mean of token probabilities, (2) the arithmetic mean of token probabilities, and (3) the arithmetic mean of the kurtosis of token distributions. These metrics provide a simple yet effective framework for evaluating translation performance. Our analysis revealed a linear relationship between the traditional evaluation metrics and our UQ metrics, demonstrating the validity of our approach. Additionally, we developed an interactive web-based visualization that uses a color gradient to represent token confidence. This tool offers users a clear and intuitive understanding of translation quality while providing valuable insights into model performance. Overall, we show that our UQ metrics and visualization are both robust and interpretable, offering practical tools for evaluating and accessing machine translation systems.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across many tasks, yet aligning them with desired behaviors remains challenging. Activation intervention has emerged as an effective and economical method to modify the behavior of LLMs. Despite considerable interest in this area, current intervention methods exclusively employ a fixed steering vector to modify model activations, lacking adaptability to diverse input semantics. To address this limitation, we propose Semantics-Adaptive Dynamic Intervention (SADI), a novel method that constructs a dynamic steering vector to intervene model activations at inference time. More specifically, SADI utilizes activation differences in contrastive pairs to precisely identify critical elements of an LLM (i.e., attention heads, hidden states, and neurons) for targeted intervention. During inference, SADI dynamically steers model behavior by scaling element-wise activations based on the directions of input semantics. Experimental results show that SADI outperforms established baselines by substantial margins, improving task performance without training. SADI's cost-effectiveness and generalizability across various LLM backbones and tasks highlight its potential as a versatile alignment technique.

      We use a duoethnographic approach to study how wearable-integrated LLM chatbots can assist with personalized stress management, addressing the growing need for immediacy and tailored interventions. Two researchers interacted with custom chatbots over 22 days, responding to wearable-detected physiological prompts, recording stressor phrases, and using them to seek tailored interventions from their LLM-powered chatbots. They recorded their experiences in autoethnographic diaries and analyzed them during weekly discussions, focusing on the relevance, clarity, and impact of chatbot-generated interventions. Results showed that even though most events triggered by the wearable were meaningful, only one in five warranted an intervention. It also showed that interventions tailored with brief event descriptions were more effective than generic ones. By examining the intersection of wearables and LLM, this research contributes to developing more effective, user-centric mental health tools for real-time stress relief and behavior change.

      Legal services rely heavily on text processing. While large language models (LLMs) show promise, their application in legal contexts demands higher accuracy, repeatability, and transparency. Logic programs, by encoding legal concepts as structured rules and facts, offer reliable automation, but require sophisticated text extraction. We propose a neuro-symbolic approach that integrates LLMs' natural language understanding with logic-based reasoning to address these limitations. As a legal document case study, we applied neuro-symbolic AI to coverage-related queries in insurance contracts using both closed and open-source LLMs. While LLMs have improved in legal reasoning, they still lack the accuracy and consistency required for complex contract analysis. In our analysis, we tested three methodologies to evaluate whether a specific claim is covered under a contract: a vanilla LLM, an unguided approach that leverages LLMs to encode both the contract and the claim, and a guided approach that uses a framework for the LLM to encode the contract. We demonstrated the promising capabilities of LLM + Logic in the guided approach.

      Web crawl is a main source of large language models' (LLMs) pretraining data, but the majority of crawled web pages are discarded in pretraining due to low data quality. This paper presents Craw4LLM, an efficient web crawling method that explores the web graph based on the preference of LLM pretraining. Specifically, it leverages the influence of a webpage in LLM pretraining as the priority score of the web crawler's scheduler, replacing the standard graph connectivity based priority. Our experiments on a web graph containing 900 million webpages from a commercial search engine's index demonstrate the efficiency of Craw4LLM in obtaining high-quality pretraining data. With just 21% URLs crawled, LLMs pretrained on Craw4LLM data reach the same downstream performances of previous crawls, significantly reducing the crawling waste and alleviating the burdens on websites.

      Log-Structured Merge-tree-based Key-Value Store (LSM-KVS) is a foundational storage engine serving diverse modern workloads, systems, and applications. To suit varying use cases, LSM-KVS allows a vast configuration space that controls core parameters like compaction, flush, and cache sizes, each consuming a shared pool of CPU, Memory, and Storage resources. Navigating the LSM-KVS configuration space necessitates knowledge of the impact of each configuration on the expected workload and underlying hardware. Beyond expensive and time-intensive human-expert-based tuning, existing LSM-KVS tuning solutions focus on tuning with specific workload expectations while limited to a narrow subset of parameters. This paper introduces ELMo-Tune-V2, a framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) at its foundation to demonstrate the potential of applying modern LLMs in data system optimization problems. ELMo-Tune-V2 leverages the contextual reasoning, cross-domain, and generative capabilities of LLMs to perform 1) self-navigated characterization and modeling of LSM-KVS workloads, 2) automatic tuning across a broad parameter space using cross-domain knowledge, and 3) real-time dynamic configuration adjustments for LSM-KVS. ELMo-Tune-V2 integrates three innovations: LLM-based workload synthesis for adaptive benchmark generation, feedback-driven iterative fine-tuning for configuration refinement, and real-time tuning to handle evolving workloads. Through detailed evaluation using RocksDB under several real-world applications across diverse scenarios, ELMo-Tune-V2 achieves performance improvements up to ~14X our YCSB benchmarks compared against default RocksDB configurations, and our end-to-end tests with upper-level applications, NebulaGraph and Kvrocks, demonstrate performance gains of 34% and 26%, respectively.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks but remain prone to hallucinations. Detecting hallucinations is essential for safety-critical applications, and recent methods leverage attention map properties to this end, though their effectiveness remains limited. In this work, we investigate the spectral features of attention maps by interpreting them as adjacency matrices of graph structures. We propose the $\text{LapEigvals}$ method, which utilises the top-$k$ eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix derived from the attention maps as an input to hallucination detection probes. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art hallucination detection performance among attention-based methods. Extensive ablation studies further highlight the robustness and generalisation of $\text{LapEigvals}$, paving the way for future advancements in the hallucination detection domain.

      Achieving full-duplex communication in spoken dialogue systems (SDS) requires real-time coordination between listening, speaking, and thinking. This paper proposes a semantic voice activity detection (VAD) module as a dialogue manager (DM) to efficiently manage turn-taking in full-duplex SDS. Implemented as a lightweight (0.5B) LLM fine-tuned on full-duplex conversation data, the semantic VAD predicts four control tokens to regulate turn-switching and turn-keeping, distinguishing between intentional and unintentional barge-ins while detecting query completion for handling user pauses and hesitations. By processing input speech in short intervals, the semantic VAD enables real-time decision-making, while the core dialogue engine (CDE) is only activated for response generation, reducing computational overhead. This design allows independent DM optimization without retraining the CDE, balancing interaction accuracy and inference efficiency for scalable, next-generation full-duplex SDS.

      Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable successes on various natural language tasks. However, recent studies have found that there are still significant challenges to the logical reasoning abilities of LLMs. This paper summarizes and categorizes the main challenges into two aspects: (1) Logical question answering, LLMs often fail to generate the correct answer within complex logical problem which requires sophisticated deductive, inductive or abductive reasoning given a collection of premises and constrains. (2) Logical consistency, LLMs are prone to producing responses contradicting themselves across different questions. For example, a state-of-the-art Macaw question-answering LLM answers Yes to both questions Is a magpie a bird? and Does a bird have wings? but answers No to Does a magpie have wings?. To facilitate this research direction, we comprehensively investigate the most cutting-edge methods and propose detailed taxonomies of these methods. Specifically, to accurately answer complex logic questions, previous methods can be categorized based on reliance on external solvers, prompts, pretraining, and fine-tuning. To avoid logical contradictions, we discuss concepts and solutions of various logical consistencies, including implication, negation, transitivity, factuality consistency, and their composites. In addition, we review commonly used benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics, and discuss promising research directions, such as extensions to modal logic to account for uncertainty, and efficient algorithms satisfying multiple logical consistencies simultaneously.

      Motivated by reducing the computational and storage costs of LLMs, model compression and KV cache compression have attracted much attention from researchers. However, current methods predominantly emphasize maintaining the performance of compressed LLMs, as measured by perplexity or simple accuracy on tasks of common sense knowledge QA and basic arithmetic reasoning. In this blog, we present a brief review of recent advancements in LLMs related to retrieval-augmented generation, multi-step reasoning, external tools, and computational expressivity, all of which substantially enhance LLM performance. Then, we propose a lottery LLM hypothesis suggesting that for a given LLM and task, there exists a smaller lottery LLM capable of producing the same performance as the original LLM with the assistance of multi-step reasoning and external tools. Based on the review of current progress in LLMs, we discuss and summarize the essential capabilities that the lottery LLM and KV cache compression must possess, which are currently overlooked in existing methods.

Through experiments on the Spider and BIRD datasets, we demonstrate that LLMs finetuned with SQLong-augmented data significantly outperform those trained on standard datasets.

      Generating accurate SQL from users' natural language questions (text-to-SQL) remains a long-standing challenge due to the complexities involved in user question understanding, database schema comprehension, and SQL generation. Traditional text-to-SQL systems, which combine human engineering and deep neural networks, have made significant progress. Subsequently, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been developed for text-to-SQL tasks, achieving promising results. However, as modern databases and user questions grow more complex, PLMs with a limited parameter size often produce incorrect SQL. This necessitates more sophisticated and tailored optimization methods, which restricts the application of PLM-based systems. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown significant capabilities in natural language understanding as model scale increases. Thus, integrating LLM-based solutions can bring unique opportunities, improvements, and solutions to text-to-SQL research. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of existing LLM-based text-to-SQL studies. Specifically, we offer a brief overview of the technical challenges and evolutionary process of text-to-SQL. Next, we introduce the datasets and metrics designed to evaluate text-to-SQL systems.

      We present RapidPen, a fully automated penetration testing (pentesting) framework that addresses the challenge of achieving an initial foothold (IP-to-Shell) without human intervention. Unlike prior approaches that focus primarily on post-exploitation or require a human-in-the-loop, RapidPen leverages large language models (LLMs) to autonomously discover and exploit vulnerabilities, starting from a single IP address. By integrating advanced ReAct-style task planning (Re) with retrieval-augmented knowledge bases of successful exploits, along with a command-generation and direct execution feedback loop (Act), RapidPen systematically scans services, identifies viable attack vectors, and executes targeted exploits in a fully automated manner. In our evaluation against a vulnerable target from the Hack The Box platform, RapidPen achieved shell access within 200-400 seconds at a per-run cost of approximately \$0.3-\$0.6, demonstrating a 60\% success rate when reusing prior "success-case" data. These results underscore the potential of truly autonomous pentesting for both security novices and seasoned professionals. Organizations without dedicated security teams can leverage RapidPen to quickly identify critical vulnerabilities, while expert pentesters can offload repetitive tasks and focus on complex challenges. Ultimately, our work aims to make penetration testing more accessible and cost-efficient, thereby enhancing the overall security posture of modern software ecosystems.

      The LLM unlearning technique has recently been introduced to comply with data regulations and address the safety and ethical concerns of LLMs by removing the undesired data-model influence. However, state-of-the-art unlearning methods face a critical vulnerability: they are susceptible to ``relearning'' the removed information from a small number of forget data points, known as relearning attacks. In this paper, we systematically investigate how to make unlearned models robust against such attacks. For the first time, we establish a connection between robust unlearning and sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) through a unified robust optimization framework, in an analogy to adversarial training designed to defend against adversarial attacks. Our analysis for SAM reveals that smoothness optimization plays a pivotal role in mitigating relearning attacks. Thus, we further explore diverse smoothing strategies to enhance unlearning robustness. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including WMDP and MUSE, demonstrate that SAM and other smoothness optimization approaches consistently improve the resistance of LLM unlearning to relearning attacks. Notably, smoothness-enhanced unlearning also helps defend against (input-level) jailbreaking attacks, broadening our proposal's impact in robustifying LLM unlearning.

      With the widespread deployment of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT4, BART, and LLaMA, the need for a system that can intelligently select the most suitable model for specific tasks while balancing cost, latency, accuracy, and ethical considerations has become increasingly important. Recognizing that not all tasks necessitate models with over 100 billion parameters, we introduce OptiRoute, an advanced model routing engine designed to dynamically select and route tasks to the optimal LLM based on detailed user-defined requirements. OptiRoute captures both functional (e.g., accuracy, speed, cost) and non-functional (e.g., helpfulness, harmlessness, honesty) criteria, leveraging lightweight task analysis and complexity estimation to efficiently match tasks with the best-fit models from a diverse array of LLMs. By employing a hybrid approach combining k-nearest neighbors (kNN) search and hierarchical filtering, OptiRoute optimizes for user priorities while minimizing computational overhead. This makes it ideal for real-time applications in cloud-based ML platforms, personalized AI services, and regulated industries.

      Understanding how large language models (LLMs) represent and reason about spatial information is crucial for building robust agentic systems that can navigate real and simulated environments. In this work, we investigate the influence of different text-based spatial representations on LLM performance and internal activations in a grid-world navigation task. By evaluating models of various sizes on a task that requires navigating toward a goal, we examine how the format used to encode spatial information impacts decision-making. Our experiments reveal that cartesian representations of space consistently yield higher success rates and path efficiency, with performance scaling markedly with model size. Moreover, probing LLaMA-3.1-8B revealed subsets of internal units, primarily located in intermediate layers, that robustly correlate with spatial features, such as the position of the agent in the grid or action correctness, regardless of how that information is represented, and are also activated by unrelated spatial reasoning tasks. This work advances our understanding of how LLMs process spatial information and provides valuable insights for developing more interpretable and robust agentic AI systems.

      Significant progress has been made in automated problem-solving using societies of agents powered by large language models (LLMs). In finance, efforts have largely focused on single-agent systems handling specific tasks or multi-agent frameworks independently gathering data. However, multi-agent systems' potential to replicate real-world trading firms' collaborative dynamics remains underexplored. TradingAgents proposes a novel stock trading framework inspired by trading firms, featuring LLM-powered agents in specialized roles such as fundamental analysts, sentiment analysts, technical analysts, and traders with varied risk profiles. The framework includes Bull and Bear researcher agents assessing market conditions, a risk management team monitoring exposure, and traders synthesizing insights from debates and historical data to make informed decisions. By simulating a dynamic, collaborative trading environment, this framework aims to improve trading performance. Detailed architecture and extensive experiments reveal its superiority over baseline models, with notable improvements in cumulative returns, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown, highlighting the potential of multi-agent LLM frameworks in financial trading.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into critical applications, aligning their behavior with human values presents significant challenges. Current methods, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), typically focus on a limited set of coarse-grained values and are resource-intensive. Moreover, the correlations between these values remain implicit, leading to unclear explanations for value-steering outcomes. Our work argues that a latent causal value graph underlies the value dimensions of LLMs and that, despite alignment training, this structure remains significantly different from human value systems. We leverage these causal value graphs to guide two lightweight value-steering methods: role-based prompting and sparse autoencoder (SAE) steering, effectively mitigating unexpected side effects. Furthermore, SAE provides a more fine-grained approach to value steering. Experiments on Gemma-2B-IT and Llama3-8B-IT demonstrate the effectiveness and controllability of our methods.

      With the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), it becomes increasingly important to understand their abilities and limitations. In two experiments, we investigate the causal and compositional reasoning abilities of LLMs and humans in the domain of object affordances, an area traditionally linked to embodied cognition. The tasks, designed from scratch to avoid data contamination, require decision-makers to select unconventional objects to replace a typical tool for a particular purpose, such as using a table tennis racket to dig a hole. In Experiment 1, we evaluated GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o, finding that GPT-4o, when given chain-of-thought prompting, performed on par with human participants, while GPT-3.5 lagged significantly. In Experiment 2, we introduced two new conditions, Distractor (more object choices, increasing difficulty) and Image (object options presented visually), and evaluated Claude 3 Sonnet and Claude 3.5 Sonnet in addition to the GPT models. The Distractor condition significantly impaired performance across humans and models, although GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 still performed well above chance. Surprisingly, the Image condition had little impact on humans or GPT-4o, but significantly lowered Claude 3.5's accuracy. Qualitative analysis showed that GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 have a stronger ability than their predecessors to identify and flexibly apply causally relevant object properties. The improvement from GPT-3.5 and Claude 3 to GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 suggests that models are increasingly capable of causal and compositional reasoning in some domains, although further mechanistic research is necessary to understand how LLMs reason.

      Large-scale language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have demonstrated impressive abilities in generating responses based on human instructions. However, their use in the medical field can be challenging due to their lack of specific, in-depth knowledge. In this study, we present a system called LLMs Augmented with Medical Textbooks (LLM-AMT) designed to enhance the proficiency of LLMs in specialized domains. LLM-AMT integrates authoritative medical textbooks into the LLMs' framework using plug-and-play modules. These modules include a Query Augmenter, a Hybrid Textbook Retriever, and a Knowledge Self-Refiner. Together, they incorporate authoritative medical knowledge. Additionally, an LLM Reader aids in contextual understanding. Our experimental results on three medical QA tasks demonstrate that LLMAMT significantly improves response quality, with accuracy gains ranging from 11.6% to 16.6%. Notably, with GPT-4-Turbo as the base model, LLM-AMT outperforms the specialized Med-PaLM 2 model pre-trained on a massive amount of medical corpus by 2-3%. We found that despite being 100x smaller in size, medical textbooks as a retrieval corpus is proven to be a more effective knowledge database than Wikipedia in the medical domain, boosting performance by 7.8%-13.7%.

      Scientific literature understanding is crucial for extracting targeted information and garnering insights, thereby significantly advancing scientific discovery. Despite the remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs), they face challenges in scientific literature understanding, primarily due to (1) a lack of scientific knowledge and (2) unfamiliarity with specialized scientific tasks. To develop an LLM specialized in scientific literature understanding, we propose a hybrid strategy that integrates continual pre-training (CPT) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to simultaneously infuse scientific domain knowledge and enhance instruction-following capabilities for domain-specific tasks.cIn this process, we identify two key challenges: (1) constructing high-quality CPT corpora, and (2) generating diverse SFT instructions. We address these challenges through a meticulous pipeline, including PDF text extraction, parsing content error correction, quality filtering, and synthetic instruction creation. Applying this strategy, we present a suite of LLMs: SciLitLLM, specialized in scientific literature understanding. These models demonstrate promising performance on scientific literature understanding benchmarks. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We present an effective framework that integrates CPT and SFT to adapt LLMs to scientific literature understanding, which can also be easily adapted to other domains. (2) We propose an LLM-based synthesis method to generate diverse and high-quality scientific instructions, resulting in a new instruction set -- SciLitIns -- for supervised fine-tuning in less-represented scientific domains. (3) SciLitLLM achieves promising performance improvements on scientific literature understanding benchmarks.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly capable across global languages. However, the ability to communicate across languages does not necessarily translate to appropriate cultural representations. A key concern is US-centric bias, where LLMs reflect US rather than local cultural values. We propose a novel methodology that compares LLM-generated response distributions against population-level opinion data from the World Value Survey across four languages (Danish, Dutch, English, and Portuguese). Using a rigorous linear mixed-effects regression framework, we compare two families of models: Google's Gemma models (2B--27B parameters) and successive iterations of OpenAI's turbo-series. Across the families of models, we find no consistent relationships between language capabilities and cultural alignment. While the Gemma models have a positive correlation between language capability and cultural alignment across languages, the OpenAI models do not. Importantly, we find that self-consistency is a stronger predictor of multicultural alignment than multilingual capabilities. Our results demonstrate that achieving meaningful cultural alignment requires dedicated effort beyond improving general language capabilities.

      Large language models (LLMs) pose significant risks due to the potential for generating harmful content or users attempting to evade guardrails. Existing studies have developed LLM-based guard models designed to moderate the input and output of threat LLMs, ensuring adherence to safety policies by blocking content that violates these protocols upon deployment. However, limited attention has been given to the reliability and calibration of such guard models. In this work, we empirically conduct comprehensive investigations of confidence calibration for 9 existing LLM-based guard models on 12 benchmarks in both user input and model output classification. Our findings reveal that current LLM-based guard models tend to 1) produce overconfident predictions, 2) exhibit significant miscalibration when subjected to jailbreak attacks, and 3) demonstrate limited robustness to the outputs generated by different types of response models. Additionally, we assess the effectiveness of post-hoc calibration methods to mitigate miscalibration. We demonstrate the efficacy of temperature scaling and, for the first time, highlight the benefits of contextual calibration for confidence calibration of guard models, particularly in the absence of validation sets. Our analysis and experiments underscore the limitations of current LLM-based guard models and provide valuable insights for the future development of well-calibrated guard models toward more reliable content moderation. We also advocate for incorporating reliability evaluation of confidence calibration when releasing future LLM-based guard models.

      Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet the choice of which model to use often involves a trade-off between performance and cost. More powerful models, though effective, come with higher expenses, while less capable models are more cost-effective. To address this dilemma, we propose several efficient router models that dynamically select between a stronger and a weaker LLM during inference, aiming to optimize the balance between cost and response quality. We develop a training framework for these routers leveraging human preference data and data augmentation techniques to enhance performance. Our evaluation on widely-recognized benchmarks shows that our approach significantly reduces costs-by over 2 times in certain cases-without compromising the quality of responses. Interestingly, our router models also demonstrate significant transfer learning capabilities, maintaining their performance even when the strong and weak models are changed at test time. This highlights the potential of these routers to provide a cost-effective yet high-performance solution for deploying LLMs.

      Large Language Model (LLM) deployment on edge devices is typically constrained by the need for off-chip memory access, leading to high power consumption and limited throughput. Ternary quantization for LLMs is promising in maintaining model accuracy while reducing memory footprint. However, existing accelerators have not exploited this potential for on-chip inference. We present TerEffic, an FPGA-based accelerator that carefully co-designs memory architecture and computational units to unlock highly efficient LLM inference with fully on-chip execution. Through weight compression, custom computational units, and memory hierarchy optimization, we achieve unprecedented efficiency by eliminating off-chip memory bandwidth bottlenecks. We propose two architectural variants: a fully on-chip design for smaller models and an HBM-assisted design for larger ones. When evaluated on a 370M parameter model with single-batch inference, our on-chip design achieves 12,700 tokens/sec (149 times higher than NVIDIA's Jetson Orin Nano) with a power efficiency of 467 tokens/sec/W (19 times better than Jetson Orin Nano). The HBM-assisted design provides 521 tokens/sec on a 2.7B parameter model (2 times higher than NVIDIA's A100) with 33W power consumption, achieving a power efficiency of 16 tokens/sec/W (8 times better than A100).

We then define a metric for measuring the format bias of LLMs and establish effective strategies to reduce it. Subsequently, we present our empirical format bias evaluation spanning four commonly used categories -- multiple-choice question-answer, wrapping, list, and mapping -- covering 15 widely-used formats. Our evaluation on eight generation tasks uncovers significant format bias across state-of-the-art LLMs. We further discover that improving the format-instruction following capabilities of LLMs across formats potentially reduces format bias.

We propose a novel analyst-inspector framework to automatically evaluate and enforce the reproducibility of LLM-generated data science workflows - the first rigorous approach to the best of our knowledge. Defining reproducibility as the sufficiency and completeness of workflows for reproducing functionally equivalent code, this framework enforces computational reproducibility principles, ensuring transparent, well-documented LLM workflows while minimizing reliance on implicit model assumptions. Using this framework, we systematically evaluate five state-of-the-art LLMs on 1,032 data analysis tasks across three diverse benchmark datasets. We also introduce two novel reproducibility-enhancing prompting strategies.

      Modern large language models (LLMs) exhibit critical vulnerabilities to poison pill attacks: localized data poisoning that alters specific factual knowledge while preserving overall model utility. We systematically demonstrate these attacks exploit inherent architectural properties of LLMs, achieving 54.6% increased retrieval inaccuracy on long-tail knowledge versus dominant topics and up to 25.5% increase retrieval inaccuracy on compressed models versus original architectures. Through controlled mutations (e.g., temporal/spatial/entity alterations) and, our method induces localized memorization deterioration with negligible impact on models' performance on regular standard benchmarks (e.g., <2% performance drop on MMLU/GPQA), leading to potential detection evasion. Our findings suggest: (1) Disproportionate vulnerability in long-tail knowledge may result from reduced parameter redundancy; (2) Model compression may increase attack surfaces, with pruned/distilled models requiring 30% fewer poison samples for equivalent damage; (3) Associative memory enables both spread of collateral damage to related concepts and amplification of damage from simultaneous attack, particularly for dominant topics. These findings raise concerns over current scaling paradigms since attack costs are lowering while defense complexity is rising. Our work establishes poison pills as both a security threat and diagnostic tool, revealing critical security-efficiency trade-offs in language model compression that challenges prevailing safety assumptions.

In this interdisciplinary work, we take a complementary "structural" perspective and shift our focus to how LLMs are trained. We operationalize a notion of "fair learning" by measuring whether any training decision substantially affected the model's memorization. As a case study, we deconstruct Pythia, an open-source LLM, and demonstrate the use of causal and correlational analyses to make factual determinations about Pythia's training decisions. By proposing a legal standard for fair learning and connecting memorization analyses to this standard, we identify how judges may advance the goals of copyright law through adjudication. Finally, we discuss how a fair learning standard might evolve to enhance its clarity by becoming more rule-like and incorporating external technical guidelines.

      Evaluating large language models (LLMs) poses significant challenges, particularly due to issues of data contamination and the leakage of correct answers. To address these challenges, we introduce ThinkBench, a novel evaluation framework designed to evaluate LLMs' reasoning capability robustly. ThinkBench proposes a dynamic data generation method for constructing out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets and offers an OOD dataset that contains 2,912 samples drawn from reasoning tasks. ThinkBench unifies the evaluation of reasoning models and non-reasoning models. We evaluate 16 LLMs and 4 PRMs under identical experimental conditions and show that most of the LLMs' performance are far from robust and they face a certain level of data leakage. By dynamically generating OOD datasets, ThinkBench effectively provides a reliable evaluation of LLMs and reduces the impact of data contamination.

      This paper presents a reproducibility study and extension of "Cooperation, Competition, and Maliciousness: LLM-Stakeholders Interactive Negotiation." We validate the original findings using a range of open-weight models (1.5B-70B parameters) and GPT-4o Mini while introducing several novel contributions. We analyze the Pareto front of the games, propose a communication-free baseline to test whether successful negotiations are possible without agent interaction, evaluate recent small language models' performance, analyze structural information leakage in model responses, and implement an inequality metric to assess negotiation fairness. Our results demonstrate that smaller models (<10B parameters) struggle with format adherence and coherent responses, but larger open-weight models can approach proprietary model performance. Additionally, in many scenarios, single-agent approaches can achieve comparable results to multi-agent negotiations, challenging assumptions about the necessity of agent communication to perform well on the benchmark. This work also provides insights into the accessibility, fairness, environmental impact, and privacy considerations of LLM-based negotiation systems.

      Tree of Thoughts (ToT) enhances Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning by structuring problem-solving as a spanning tree. However, recent methods focus on search accuracy while overlooking computational efficiency. The challenges of accelerating the ToT lie in the frequent switching of reasoning focus, and the redundant exploration of suboptimal solutions. To alleviate this dilemma, we propose Dynamic Parallel Tree Search (DPTS), a novel parallelism framework that aims to dynamically optimize the reasoning path in inference. It includes the Parallelism Streamline in the generation phase to build up a flexible and adaptive parallelism with arbitrary paths by fine-grained cache management and alignment. Meanwhile, the Search and Transition Mechanism filters potential candidates to dynamically maintain the reasoning focus on more possible solutions and have less redundancy. Experiments on Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3 with Math500 and GSM8K datasets show that DPTS significantly improves efficiency by 2-4x on average while maintaining or even surpassing existing reasoning algorithms in accuracy, making ToT-based reasoning more scalable and computationally efficient.

      As LLMs become more widely deployed, there is increasing interest in directly optimizing for feedback from end users (e.g. thumbs up) in addition to feedback from paid annotators. However, training to maximize human feedback creates a perverse incentive structure for the AI to resort to manipulative or deceptive tactics to obtain positive feedback from users who are vulnerable to such strategies. We study this phenomenon by training LLMs with Reinforcement Learning with simulated user feedback in environments of practical LLM usage. In our settings, we find that: 1) Extreme forms of "feedback gaming" such as manipulation and deception are learned reliably; 2) Even if only 2% of users are vulnerable to manipulative strategies, LLMs learn to identify and target them while behaving appropriately with other users, making such behaviors harder to detect; 3) To mitigate this issue, it may seem promising to leverage continued safety training or LLM-as-judges during training to filter problematic outputs. Instead, we found that while such approaches help in some of our settings, they backfire in others, sometimes even leading to subtler manipulative behaviors. We hope our results can serve as a case study which highlights the risks of using gameable feedback sources -- such as user feedback -- as a target for RL.

      Wireless key generation holds significant promise for establishing cryptographic keys in Next-Gen Internet of Vehicles (IoV) systems. However, existing approaches often face inefficiencies and performance limitations caused by frequent channel probing and ineffective quantization. To address these challenges, this paper introduces LLMKey, a novel key generation system designed to enhance efficiency and security. We identify excessive channel probing and suboptimal quantization as critical bottlenecks in current methods. To mitigate these issues, we propose an innovative large language model (LLM)-based channel probing technique that leverages the capabilities of LLMs to reduce probing rounds while preserving crucial channel information. Instead of conventional quantization, LLMKey adopts a perturbed compressed sensing-based key delivery mechanism, improving both robustness and security. Extensive evaluations are conducted in four real-world scenarios, encompassing V2I (Vehicle-to-Infrastructure) and V2V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle) settings in both urban and rural environments. The results show that LLMKey achieves an average key agreement rate of 98.78\%, highlighting its effectiveness and reliability across diverse conditions.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have empowered generative recommendation systems through fine-tuning user behavior data. However, utilizing the user data may pose significant privacy risks, potentially leading to ethical dilemmas and violations of data protection regulations. To address the privacy concerns, Federated Learning for Recommendation (Fed4Rec) has been identified as a promising solution. However, directly applying Fed4Rec in the LLM context introduces two challenges: 1) exacerbated client performance imbalance, which ultimately impacts the system's long-term effectiveness, and 2) substantial client resource costs, posing a high demand for clients' both computational and storage capability to locally train and infer LLMs. To tackle these challenges, we propose a federated framework for LLM-based recommendation (shorted as FELLRec). Generally, FELLRec designs two key strategies. 1) Dynamic balance strategy, which designs dynamic parameter aggregation and learning speed for different clients, aiming to ensure balanced performance across clients. 2) Flexible storage strategy, which selectively retains certain sensitive LLM layers on the client side, while offloading other layers to the server, aiming to preserve privacy while saving resources. Experiment results show that FELLRec can achieve a more balanced client performance and improved overall performance in a computational and storage-efficient way while safeguarding user privacy well.

      Ensuring the safety of the Large Language Model (LLM) is critical, but currently used methods in most cases sacrifice the model performance to obtain increased safety or perform poorly on data outside of their adaptation distribution. We investigate existing methods for such generalization and find them insufficient. Surprisingly, while even plain LLMs recognize unsafe prompts, they may still generate unsafe responses. To avoid performance degradation and preserve safe performance, we advocate for a two-step framework, where we first identify unsafe prompts via a lightweight classifier, and apply a "safe" model only to such prompts. In particular, we explore the design of the safety detector in more detail, investigating the use of different classifier architectures and prompting techniques. Interestingly, we find that the final hidden state for the last token is enough to provide robust performance, minimizing false positives on benign data while performing well on malicious prompt detection. Additionally, we show that classifiers trained on the representations from different model layers perform comparably on the latest model layers, indicating that safety representation is present in the LLMs' hidden states at most model stages. Our work is a step towards efficient, representation-based safety mechanisms for LLMs.

      Inductive reasoning, a cornerstone of human cognition, enables generalization from limited data but hasn't yet been fully achieved by large language models (LLMs). While modern LLMs excel at reasoning tasks, their ability to maintain stable and consistent rule abstraction under imperfect observations remains underexplored. To fill this gap, in this work, we introduce Robust Rule Induction, a task that evaluates LLMs' capability in inferring rules from data that are fused with noisy examples. To address this task, we further propose Sample-steered Rule Refinement (SRR), a method enhancing reasoning stability via observation diversification and execution-guided feedback. Experiments across arithmetic, cryptography, and list functions reveal: (1) SRR outperforms other methods with minimal performance degradation under noise; (2) Despite slight accuracy variation, LLMs exhibit instability under noise (e.g., 0% accuracy change with only 70% consistent score); (3) Counterfactual task gaps highlight LLMs' reliance on memorized patterns over genuine abstraction. Our findings challenge LLMs' reasoning robustness, revealing susceptibility to hypothesis drift and pattern overfitting, while providing empirical evidence critical for developing human-like inductive systems.

      Humans are believed to perceive numbers on a logarithmic mental number line, where smaller values are represented with greater resolution than larger ones. This cognitive bias, supported by neuroscience and behavioral studies, suggests that numerical magnitudes are processed in a sublinear fashion rather than on a uniform linear scale. Inspired by this hypothesis, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit a similar logarithmic-like structure in their internal numerical representations. By analyzing how numerical values are encoded across different layers of LLMs, we apply dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA and PLS followed by geometric regression to uncover latent structures in the learned embeddings. Our findings reveal that the model's numerical representations exhibit sublinear spacing, with distances between values aligning with a logarithmic scale. This suggests that LLMs, much like humans, may encode numbers in a compressed, non-uniform manner.

      Hallucination is a persistent challenge in large language models (LLMs), where even with rigorous quality control, models often generate distorted facts. This paradox, in which error generation continues despite high-quality training data, calls for a deeper understanding of the underlying LLM mechanisms. To address it, we propose a novel concept: knowledge overshadowing, where model's dominant knowledge can obscure less prominent knowledge during text generation, causing the model to fabricate inaccurate details. Building on this idea, we introduce a novel framework to quantify factual hallucinations by modeling knowledge overshadowing. Central to our approach is the log-linear law, which predicts that the rate of factual hallucination increases linearly with the logarithmic scale of (1) Knowledge Popularity, (2) Knowledge Length, and (3) Model Size. The law provides a means to preemptively quantify hallucinations, offering foresight into their occurrence even before model training or inference. Built on overshadowing effect, we propose a new decoding strategy CoDa, to mitigate hallucinations, which notably enhance model factuality on Overshadow (27.9%), MemoTrap (13.1%) and NQ-Swap (18.3%). Our findings not only deepen understandings of the underlying mechanisms behind hallucinations but also provide actionable insights for developing more predictable and controllable language models.

Our analysis reveals that the LLM contributes significantly to improvements in rare word error rate (R-WER), while the speech encoder primarily determines overall transcription performance (Orthographic Word Error Rate, O-WER, and Normalized Word Error Rate, N-WER). Through extensive ablation studies, we highlight the importance of adapter integration in aligning speech encoder outputs with the LLM's linguistic capabilities. Furthermore, we emphasize the critical role of high-quality labeled data in achieving optimal performance.

      Mixture-of-Experts large language models (MoE-LLMs) marks a significant step forward of language models, however, they encounter two critical challenges in practice: 1) expert parameters lead to considerable memory consumption and loading latency; and 2) the current activated experts are redundant, as many tokens may only require a single expert. Motivated by these issues, we investigate the MoE-LLMs and make two key observations: a) different experts exhibit varying behaviors on activation reconstruction error, routing scores, and activated frequencies, highlighting their differing importance, and b) not all tokens are equally important -- only a small subset is critical. Building on these insights, we propose MC, a training-free Mixture-Compressor for MoE-LLMs, which leverages the significance of both experts and tokens to achieve an extreme compression. First, to mitigate storage and loading overheads, we introduce Pre-Loading Mixed-Precision Quantization, which formulates the adaptive bit-width allocation as a Linear Programming problem, where the objective function balances multi-factors reflecting the importance of each expert. Additionally, we develop Online Dynamic Pruning, which identifies important tokens to retain and dynamically select activated experts for other tokens during inference to optimize efficiency while maintaining performance. Our MC integrates static quantization and dynamic pruning to collaboratively achieve extreme compression for MoE-LLMs with less accuracy loss, ensuring an optimal trade-off between performance and efficiency. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our approach. For instance, at 2.54 bits, MC compresses 76.6% of the model, with only a 3.8% average accuracy loss. During dynamic inference, we further reduce activated parameters by 15%, with a performance drop of less than 0.6%.

      The advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the field of text generation, producing outputs that closely mimic human-like writing. Although academic and industrial institutions have developed detectors to prevent the malicious usage of LLM-generated texts, other research has doubt about the robustness of these systems. To stress test these detectors, we introduce a proxy-attack strategy that effortlessly compromises LLMs, causing them to produce outputs that align with human-written text and mislead detection systems. Our method attacks the source model by leveraging a reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuned humanized small language model (SLM) in the decoding phase. Through an in-depth analysis, we demonstrate that our attack strategy is capable of generating responses that are indistinguishable to detectors, preventing them from differentiating between machine-generated and human-written text. We conduct systematic evaluations on extensive datasets using proxy-attacked open-source models, including Llama2-13B, Llama3-70B, and Mixtral-8*7B in both white- and black-box settings. Our findings show that the proxy-attack strategy effectively deceives the leading detectors, resulting in an average AUROC drop of 70.4% across multiple datasets, with a maximum drop of 90.3% on a single dataset. Furthermore, in cross-discipline scenarios, our strategy also bypasses these detectors, leading to a significant relative decrease of up to 90.9%, while in cross-language scenario, the drop reaches 91.3%. Despite our proxy-attack strategy successfully bypassing the detectors with such significant relative drops, we find that the generation quality of the attacked models remains preserved, even within a modest utility budget, when compared to the text produced by the original, unattacked source model.

      Model merging has emerged as a promising approach for updating large language models (LLMs) by integrating multiple domain-specific models into a cross-domain merged model. Despite its utility and plug-and-play nature, unmonitored mergers can introduce significant security vulnerabilities, such as backdoor attacks and model merging abuse. In this paper, we identify a novel and more realistic attack surface where a malicious merger can extract targeted personally identifiable information (PII) from an aligned model with model merging. Specifically, we propose \texttt{Merger-as-a-Stealer}, a two-stage framework to achieve this attack: First, the attacker fine-tunes a malicious model to force it to respond to any PII-related queries. The attacker then uploads this malicious model to the model merging conductor and obtains the merged model. Second, the attacker inputs direct PII-related queries to the merged model to extract targeted PII. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{Merger-as-a-Stealer} successfully executes attacks against various LLMs and model merging methods across diverse settings, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Given that this attack enables character-level extraction for targeted PII without requiring any additional knowledge from the attacker, we stress the necessity for improved model alignment and more robust defense mechanisms to mitigate such threats.

      Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are valuable tools for representing relationships between entities in a structured format. Traditionally, these knowledge bases are queried to extract specific information. However, question-answering (QA) over such KGs poses a challenge due to the intrinsic complexity of natural language compared to the structured format and the size of these graphs. Despite these challenges, the structured nature of KGs can provide a solid foundation for grounding the outputs of Large Language Models (LLMs), offering organizations increased reliability and control. Recent advancements in LLMs have introduced reasoning methods at inference time to improve their performance and maximize their capabilities. In this work, we propose integrating these reasoning strategies with KGs to anchor every step or "thought" of the reasoning chains in KG data. Specifically, we evaluate both agentic and automated search methods across several reasoning strategies, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Tree-of-Thought (ToT), and Graph-of-Thought (GoT), using GRBench, a benchmark dataset for graph reasoning with domain-specific graphs.

      Objective: OpenNotes enables patients to access EHR notes, but medical jargon can hinder comprehension. To improve understanding, we evaluated closed- and open-source LLMs for extracting and prioritizing key medical terms using prompting, fine-tuning, and data augmentation. Materials and Methods: We assessed LLMs on 106 expert-annotated EHR notes, experimenting with (i) general vs. structured prompts, (ii) zero-shot vs. few-shot prompting, (iii) fine-tuning, and (iv) data augmentation. To enhance open-source models in low-resource settings, we used ChatGPT for data augmentation and applied ranking techniques. We incrementally increased the augmented dataset size (10 to 10,000) and conducted 5-fold cross-validation, reporting F1 score and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). Results and Discussion: Fine-tuning and data augmentation improved performance over other strategies. GPT-4 Turbo achieved the highest F1 (0.433), while Mistral7B with data augmentation had the highest MRR (0.746). Open-source models, when fine-tuned or augmented, outperformed closed-source models. Notably, the best F1 and MRR scores did not always align. Few-shot prompting outperformed zero-shot in vanilla models, and structured prompts yielded different preferences across models. Fine-tuning improved zero-shot performance but sometimes degraded few-shot performance. Data augmentation performed comparably or better than other methods. Conclusion: Our evaluation highlights the effectiveness of prompting, fine-tuning, and data augmentation in improving model performance for medical jargon extraction in low-resource scenarios.

This study uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to explore the longitudinal abuse and sentiment analysis of Hollywood Oscar and blockbuster movie dialogues from 1950 to 2024. By employing fine-tuned LLMs, we analyze subtitles for over a thousand movies categorised into four genres to examine the trends and shifts in emotional and abusive content over the past seven decades. Our findings reveal significant temporal changes in movie dialogues, which reflect broader social and cultural influences. Overall, the emotional tendencies in the films are diverse, and the detection of abusive content also exhibits significant fluctuations. The results show a gradual rise in abusive content in recent decades, reflecting social norms and regulatory policy changes. Genres such as thrillers still present a higher frequency of abusive content that emphasises the ongoing narrative role of violence and conflict. At the same time, underlying positive emotions such as humour and optimism remain prevalent in most of the movies. Furthermore, the gradual increase of abusive content in movie dialogues has been significant over the last two decades, where Oscar-nominated movies overtook the top ten blockbusters.

      Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential to accelerate drug discovery. However, the specialized nature of biochemical data often necessitates costly domain-specific fine-tuning, posing critical challenges. First, it hinders the application of more flexible general-purpose LLMs in cutting-edge drug discovery tasks. More importantly, it impedes the rapid integration of the vast amounts of scientific data continuously generated through experiments and research. To investigate these challenges, we propose CLADD, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-empowered agentic system tailored to drug discovery tasks. Through the collaboration of multiple LLM agents, CLADD dynamically retrieves information from biomedical knowledge bases, contextualizes query molecules, and integrates relevant evidence to generate responses -- all without the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. Crucially, we tackle key obstacles in applying RAG workflows to biochemical data, including data heterogeneity, ambiguity, and multi-source integration. We demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of this framework across a variety of drug discovery tasks, showing that it outperforms general-purpose and domain-specific LLMs as well as traditional deep learning approaches.

      Understanding the reliability of large language models (LLMs) has recently garnered significant attention. Given LLMs' propensity to hallucinate, as well as their high sensitivity to prompt design, it is already challenging to predict the performance of an individual LLM. However, the problem becomes more complex for compound LLM systems such as cascades, where in addition to each model's standalone performance, we must understand how the error rates of different models interact. In this paper, we present a probabilistic model for the joint performance distribution of a sequence of LLMs, which enables a framework for rationally tuning the confidence thresholds of a LLM cascade using continuous optimization. Compared to selecting confidence thresholds using grid search, our parametric Markov-copula model significantly improves runtime scaling with respect to the length of the cascade and the desired resolution of the cost-error curve, turning them from intractable into low-order polynomial. In addition, the optimal thresholds computed using our continuous optimization-based algorithm increasingly outperform those found via grid search as cascade length grows, improving the area under the cost-error curve by 1.9% on average for cascades consisting of at least three models. Overall, our Markov-copula model provides a rational basis for tuning LLM cascade performance and points to the potential of probabilistic methods in analyzing LLM systems.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced with external contexts, such as through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), often face challenges in handling imperfect evidence. They tend to over-rely on external knowledge, making them vulnerable to misleading and unhelpful contexts. To address this, we propose the concept of context-robust LLMs, which can effectively balance internal knowledge with external context, similar to human cognitive processes. Specifically, context-robust LLMs should rely on external context only when lacking internal knowledge, identify contradictions between internal and external knowledge, and disregard unhelpful contexts. To achieve this goal, we introduce Grft, a lightweight and plug-and-play gated representation fine-tuning approach. Grft consists of two key components: a gating mechanism to detect and filter problematic inputs, and low-rank representation adapters to adjust hidden representations. By training a lightweight intervention function with only 0.0004\% of model size on fewer than 200 examples, Grft can effectively adapt LLMs towards context-robust behaviors.

      We show that Large Language Model from Power Law Decoder Representations (PLDR-LLM) is a foundational model whose deductive outputs are invariant tensors up to a small perturbation. PLDR-LLM learns a singularity condition for the deductive outputs that enable the once-inferred energy-curvature tensor $\mathbf{G}_{LM}$ to replace the deep neural network of power law graph attention (PLGA) generating the deductive outputs at inference. We demonstrate that a cache for $\mathbf{G}_{LM}$ (G-cache) and KV-cache can be implemented in a straightforward manner to improve the inference time. The invariance and generalizable nature of deductive outputs is at a very high fidelity where deductive outputs have same RMSE and determinant values up to 15 decimal places after caching, and zero-shot benchmark scores remain unchanged. Ablation studies show that learned deductive outputs have distinct loss and accuracy characteristics from models pretrained with transferred, randomly initialized or identity tensors as a constant tensor operator and an LLM with scaled-dot product attention (SDPA) is a special case of PLDR-LLM where $\mathbf{G}_{LM}$ is predefined as identity. The observed invariance characteristic introduces a novel asymmetry between training and inference phases with caching. We outline observed common characteristics of the deductive outputs for the learned singularity condition. We provide an implementation of a training and inference framework for PLDR-LLM with KV-cache and G-cache.

      Most safety training methods for large language models (LLMs) based on fine-tuning rely on dramatically changing the output distribution of the model when faced with a harmful request, shifting it from an unsafe answer to a refusal to respond. These methods inherently compromise model capabilities and might make auto-regressive models vulnerable to attacks that make likely an initial token of affirmative response. To avoid that, we propose to expand the model's vocabulary with a special token we call red flag token (<rf>) and propose to fine-tune the model to generate this token at any time harmful content is generated or about to be generated. This novel safety training method effectively augments LLMs into generative classifiers of harmfulness at all times during the conversation. This method offers several advantages: it enables the model to explicitly learn the concept of harmfulness while marginally affecting the generated distribution, thus maintaining the model's utility. It also evaluates each generated answer rather than just the input prompt and provides a stronger defence against sampling-based attacks. In addition, it simplifies the evaluation of the model's robustness and reduces correlated failures when combined with a classifier. We further show an increased robustness to long contexts, and supervised fine-tuning attacks.

However, the nature of these extracted features and their alignment with human-engineered ones remain unexplored. In this work, we investigate the internal mechanisms of state-of-the-art, fine-tuned LLMs for passage reranking. We employ a probing-based analysis to examine neuron activations in ranking LLMs, identifying the presence of known human-engineered and semantic features. Our study spans a broad range of feature categories, including lexical signals, document structure, query-document interactions, and complex semantic representations, to uncover underlying patterns influencing ranking decisions. Through experiments on four different ranking LLMs, we identify statistical IR features that are prominently encoded in LLM activations, as well as others that are notably missing. Furthermore, we analyze how these models respond to out-of-distribution queries and documents, revealing distinct generalization behaviors. By dissecting the latent representations within LLM activations, we aim to improve both the interpretability and effectiveness of ranking models. Our findings offer crucial insights for developing more transparent and reliable retrieval systems, and we release all necessary scripts and code to support further exploration.

In this paper, we assess the effectiveness of LLMs in addressing discourse-level ERE tasks characterized by lengthy documents and intricate relations encompassing coreference, temporal, causal, and subevent types. Evaluation is conducted using an commercial model, GPT-3.5, and an open-source model, LLaMA-2. Our study reveals a notable underperformance of LLMs compared to the baseline established through supervised learning. Although Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) can improve LLMs performance, it does not scale well compared to the smaller supervised baseline model. Our quantitative and qualitative analysis shows that LLMs have several weaknesses when applied for extracting event relations, including a tendency to fabricate event mentions, and failures to capture transitivity rules among relations, detect long distance relations, or comprehend contexts with dense event mentions.

      Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a pivotal technique for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on specific tasks. However, prevailing RL fine-tuning methods predominantly rely on PPO and its variants. Though these algorithms are effective in general RL settings, they often exhibit suboptimal performance and vulnerability to distribution collapse when applied to the fine-tuning of LLMs. In this paper, we propose CORY, extending the RL fine-tuning of LLMs to a sequential cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, to leverage the inherent coevolution and emergent capabilities of multi-agent systems. In CORY, the LLM to be fine-tuned is initially duplicated into two autonomous agents: a pioneer and an observer. The pioneer generates responses based on queries, while the observer generates responses using both the queries and the pioneer's responses. The two agents are trained together. During training, the agents exchange roles periodically, fostering cooperation and coevolution between them. Experiments evaluate CORY's performance by fine-tuning GPT-2 and Llama-2 under subjective and objective reward functions on the IMDB Review and GSM8K datasets, respectively. Results show that CORY outperforms PPO in terms of policy optimality, resistance to distribution collapse, and training robustness, thereby underscoring its potential as a superior methodology for refining LLMs in real-world applications.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across various NLP benchmarks. However, excelling in complex tasks that require nuanced reasoning and precise decision-making demands more than raw language proficiency--LLMs must reason, i.e., think logically, draw from past experiences, and synthesize information to reach conclusions and take action. To enhance reasoning abilities, approaches such as prompting and fine-tuning have been widely explored. While these methods have led to clear improvements in reasoning, their impact on LLM safety remains less understood. In this work, we investigate the interplay between reasoning and safety in LLMs. We highlight the latent safety risks that arise as reasoning capabilities improve, shedding light on previously overlooked vulnerabilities. At the same time, we explore how reasoning itself can be leveraged to enhance safety, uncovering potential mitigation strategies. By examining both the risks and opportunities in reasoning-driven LLM safety, our study provides valuable insights for developing models that are not only more capable but also more trustworthy in real-world deployments.

Evaluations on HH-RLHF and TL;DR datasets show that RLTHF reaches full-human annotation-level alignment with only 6-7% of the human annotation effort.

      In recent years, widespread internet adoption and the growth in userbase of various social media platforms have led to an increase in the proliferation of extreme speech online. While traditional language models have demonstrated proficiency in distinguishing between neutral text and non-neutral text (i.e. extreme speech), categorizing the diverse types of extreme speech presents significant challenges. The task of extreme speech classification is particularly nuanced, as it requires a deep understanding of socio-cultural contexts to accurately interpret the intent of the language used by the speaker. Even human annotators often disagree on the appropriate classification of such content, emphasizing the complex and subjective nature of this task. The use of human moderators also presents a scaling issue, necessitating the need for automated systems for extreme speech classification. The recent launch of ChatGPT has drawn global attention to the potential applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) across a diverse variety of tasks. Trained on vast and diverse corpora, and demonstrating the ability to effectively capture and encode contextual information, LLMs emerge as highly promising tools for tackling this specific task of extreme speech classification. In this paper, we leverage the Indian subset of the extreme speech dataset from Maronikolakis et al.

Although GPT-based models outperform Llama models in zero-shot settings, the performance gap disappears after fine-tuning.

      Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have upgraded them from sophisticated text generators to autonomous agents capable of corporation and tool use in multi-agent systems (MASs). However, the robustness of these LLM-based MASs, especially under knowledge conflicts, remains unclear. In this paper, we design four comprehensive metrics to investigate the robustness of MASs when facing mild or task-critical knowledge conflicts. We first analyze mild knowledge conflicts introduced by heterogeneous agents and find that they do not harm system robustness but instead improve collaborative decision-making. Next, we investigate task-critical knowledge conflicts by synthesizing knowledge conflicts and embedding them into one of the agents. Our results show that these conflicts have surprisingly little to no impact on MAS robustness. Furthermore, we observe that MASs demonstrate certain self-repairing capabilities by reducing their reliance on knowledge conflicts and adopting alternative solution paths to maintain stability. Finally, we conduct ablation studies on the knowledge conflict number, agent number, and interaction rounds, finding that the self-repairing capability of MASs has intrinsic limits, and all findings hold consistently across various factors.

      Large language models (LLMs) have achieved decent results on automated program repair (APR). However, the next token prediction training objective of decoder-only LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) is misaligned with the masked span prediction objective of current infilling-style methods, which impedes LLMs from fully leveraging pre-trained knowledge for program repair. In addition, while some LLMs can locate and repair bugs in certain functions using the related artifacts (e.g., test cases), existing methods still depend on statement-level fault localization methods to provide a list of buggy hunks for repair. This restriction hinders LLMs from exploring potential patches beyond the given locations. In this paper, we investigate a new approach to adapt LLMs to program repair. Our core insight is that LLM's APR capability can be greatly improved by simply aligning the output to their training objective and allowing them to refine the whole program without first identifying faulty statements. Based on this insight, we designed D4C, a straightforward prompting framework for APR. D4C can repair 180 bugs correctly in Defects4J, with each patch being sampled only 10 times. This surpasses the SOTA APR methods with perfect fault localization by 10% and reduces the patch sampling number by 90%. Our findings reveal that (1) objective alignment is crucial for fully exploiting LLM's pre-trained capability, and (2) replacing the traditional localize-buggy-hunks-then-repair workflow with direct debugging is more effective for LLM-based APR methods. Thus, we believe this paper introduces a new mindset for harnessing LLMs in APR.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various educational tasks, yet their alignment with human learning patterns, particularly in predicting which incorrect options students are most likely to select in multiple-choice questions (MCQs), remains underexplored. Our work investigates the relationship between LLM generation likelihood and student response distributions in MCQs with a specific focus on distractor selections. We collect a comprehensive dataset of MCQs with real-world student response distributions to explore two fundamental research questions: (1). RQ1 - Do the distractors that students more frequently select correspond to those that LLMs assign higher generation likelihood to? (2). RQ2 - When an LLM selects a incorrect choice, does it choose the same distractor that most students pick? Our experiments reveals moderate correlations between LLM-assigned probabilities and student selection patterns for distractors in MCQs. Additionally, when LLMs make mistakes, they are more likley to select the same incorrect answers that commonly mislead students, which is a pattern consistent across both small and large language models. Our work provides empirical evidence that despite LLMs' strong performance on generating educational content, there remains a gap between LLM's underlying reasoning process and human cognitive processes in identifying confusing distractors. Our findings also have significant implications for educational assessment development. The smaller language models could be efficiently utilized for automated distractor generation as they demonstrate similar patterns in identifying confusing answer choices as larger language models. This observed alignment between LLMs and student misconception patterns opens new opportunities for generating high-quality distractors that complement traditional human-designed distractors.

      Quantization is a powerful tool for accelerating large language model (LLM) inference, but the accuracy-performance trade-offs across different formats remain unclear. In this paper, we conduct the most comprehensive empirical study to date, evaluating FP8, INT8, and INT4 quantization across academic benchmarks and real-world tasks on the entire Llama-3.1 model family. Through over 500,000 evaluations, our investigation yields several key findings: (1) FP8 (W8A8-FP) is effectively lossless across all model scales, (2) well-tuned INT8 (W8A8-INT) achieves surprisingly low (1-3\%) accuracy degradation, and (3) INT4 weight-only (W4A16-INT) is more competitive than expected, rivaling 8-bit quantization. Further, we investigate the optimal quantization format for different deployments by analyzing inference performance through the popular vLLM framework. Our analysis provides clear deployment recommendations: W4A16 is the most cost-efficient for synchronous setups, while W8A8 dominates in asynchronous continuous batching. For mixed workloads, the optimal choice depends on the specific use case. Our findings offer practical, data-driven guidelines for deploying quantized LLMs at scale -- ensuring the best balance between speed, efficiency, and accuracy.

      Text-to-SQL models, which parse natural language (NL) questions to executable SQL queries, are increasingly adopted in real-world applications. However, deploying such models in the real world often requires adapting them to the highly specialized database schemas used in specific applications. We find that existing text-to-SQL models experience significant performance drops when applied to new schemas, primarily due to the lack of domain-specific data for fine-tuning. This data scarcity also limits the ability to effectively evaluate model performance in new domains. Continuously obtaining high-quality text-to-SQL data for evolving schemas is prohibitively expensive in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose SQLsynth, a human-in-the-loop text-to-SQL data annotation system. SQLsynth streamlines the creation of high-quality text-to-SQL datasets through human-LLM collaboration in a structured workflow. A within-subjects user study comparing SQLsynth with manual annotation and ChatGPT shows that SQLsynth significantly accelerates text-to-SQL data annotation, reduces cognitive load, and produces datasets that are more accurate, natural, and diverse.

      News recommender systems play a critical role in mitigating the information overload problem. In recent years, due to the successful applications of large language model technologies, researchers have utilized Discriminative Large Language Models (DLLMs) or Generative Large Language Models (GLLMs) to improve the performance of news recommender systems. Although several recent surveys review significant challenges for deep learning-based news recommender systems, such as fairness, privacy-preserving, and responsibility, there is a lack of a systematic survey on Large Language Model (LLM)-based news recommender systems. In order to review different core methodologies and explore potential issues systematically, we categorize DLLM-based and GLLM-based news recommender systems under the umbrella of LLM-based news recommender systems. In this survey, we first overview the development of deep learning-based news recommender systems. Then, we review LLM-based news recommender systems based on three aspects: news-oriented modeling, user-oriented modeling, and prediction-oriented modeling. Next, we examine the challenges from various perspectives, including datasets, benchmarking tools, and methodologies. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments to analyze how large language model technologies affect the performance of different news recommender systems. Finally, we comprehensively explore the future directions for LLM-based news recommendations in the era of LLMs.

      Accountability is an innate part of social systems. It maintains stability and ensures positive pressure on individuals' decision-making. As actors in a social system, software developers are accountable to their team and organization for their decisions. However, the drivers of accountability and how it changes behavior in software development are less understood. In this study, we look at how the social aspects of code review affect software engineers' sense of accountability for code quality. Since software engineering (SE) is increasingly involving Large Language Models (LLM) assistance, we also evaluate the impact on accountability when introducing LLM-assisted code reviews. We carried out a two-phased sequential qualitative study (interviews -> focus groups). In Phase I (16 interviews), we sought to investigate the intrinsic drivers of software engineers influencing their sense of accountability for code quality, relying on self-reported claims. In Phase II, we tested these traits in a more natural setting by simulating traditional peer-led reviews with focus groups and then LLM-assisted review sessions. We found that there are four key intrinsic drivers of accountability for code quality: personal standards, professional integrity, pride in code quality, and maintaining one's reputation. In a traditional peer-led review, we observed a transition from individual to collective accountability when code reviews are initiated. We also found that the introduction of LLM-assisted reviews disrupts this accountability process, challenging the reciprocity of accountability taking place in peer-led evaluations, i.e., one cannot be accountable to an LLM. Our findings imply that the introduction of AI into SE must preserve social integrity and collective accountability mechanisms.

      Solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) is ubiquitous in science and engineering. Computational complexity and difficulty in writing numerical solvers has motivated the development of data-driven machine learning techniques to generate solutions quickly. The recent rise in popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled easy integration of text in multimodal machine learning models, allowing easy integration of additional system information such as boundary conditions and governing equations through text. In this work, we explore using pretrained LLMs to integrate various amounts of known system information into PDE learning. Using FactFormer as our testing backbone, we add a multimodal block to fuse numerical and textual information. We compare sentence-level embeddings, word-level embeddings, and a standard tokenizer across 2D Heat, Burgers, Navier-Stokes, and Shallow-Water data sets. These challenging benchmarks show that pretrained LLMs are able to utilize text descriptions of system information and enable accurate prediction using only initial conditions.

      Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated increasingly sophisticated performance in medical and other fields of knowledge. Traditional methods of creating specialist LLMs require extensive fine-tuning and training of models on large datasets. Recently, prompt engineering, instead of fine-tuning, has shown potential to boost the performance of general foundation models. However, prompting methods such as chain-of-thought (CoT) may not be suitable for all subspecialty, and k-shot approaches may introduce irrelevant tokens into the context space. We present AutoMedPrompt, which explores the use of textual gradients to elicit medically relevant reasoning through system prompt optimization. AutoMedPrompt leverages TextGrad's automatic differentiation via text to improve the ability of general foundation LLMs. We evaluated AutoMedPrompt on Llama 3, an open-source LLM, using several QA benchmarks, including MedQA, PubMedQA, and the nephrology subspecialty-specific NephSAP. Our results show that prompting with textual gradients outperforms previous methods on open-source LLMs and surpasses proprietary models such as GPT-4, Claude 3 Opus, and Med-PaLM 2. AutoMedPrompt sets a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on PubMedQA with an accuracy of 82.6$\%$, while also outperforming previous prompting strategies on open-sourced models for MedQA (77.7$\%$) and NephSAP (63.8$\%$).

Public health organizations are increasingly turning to Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve access to timely and personalized information. However, recent HCI scholarship indicates that significant challenges remain in incorporating context awareness and mitigating bias in LLMs. In this paper, we study the development of a culturally-appropriate LLM-based chatbot for reproductive health with underserved women in urban India. Through user interactions, focus groups, and interviews with multiple stakeholders, we examine the chatbot's response to sensitive and highly contextual queries on reproductive health. Our findings reveal strengths and limitations of the system in capturing local context, and complexities around what constitutes "culture". Finally, we discuss how local context might be better integrated, and present a framework to inform the design of culturally-sensitive chatbots for community health.

      LLMs are commonly trained with a learning rate (LR) warmup, followed by cosine decay to 10% of the maximum (10x decay). In a large-scale empirical study, we show that under an optimal peak LR, a simple linear decay-to-zero (D2Z) schedule consistently outperforms other schedules when training at compute-optimal dataset sizes. D2Z is superior across a range of model sizes, batch sizes, datasets, and vocabularies. Benefits increase as dataset size increases. Leveraging a novel interpretation of AdamW as an exponential moving average of weight updates, we show how linear D2Z optimally balances the demands of early training (moving away from initial conditions) and late training (averaging over more updates in order to mitigate gradient noise). In experiments, a 610M-parameter model trained for 80 tokens-per-parameter (TPP) using D2Z achieves lower loss than when trained for 200 TPP using 10x decay, corresponding to an astonishing 60% compute savings. Models such as Llama2-7B, trained for 286 TPP with 10x decay, could likely have saved a majority of compute by training with D2Z.

With the rise of large language models (LLMs) and generative AI, developers now have access to a wealth of high-quality open-source models and APIs from closed-source providers, enabling easier experimentation and integration of LLMs into various systems. This has also opened new possibilities in mobile application (app) development, allowing for more personalized and intelligent apps. However, integrating LLM into mobile apps might present unique challenges for developers, particularly regarding mobile device constraints, API management, and code infrastructure. In this project, we constructed a comprehensive dataset of 149 LLM-enabled Android apps and conducted an exploratory analysis to understand how LLMs are deployed and used within mobile apps. This analysis highlights key characteristics of the dataset, prevalent integration strategies, and common challenges developers face.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have attained human-level fluency in text generation, which complicates the distinguishing between human-written and LLM-generated texts. This increases the risk of misuse and highlights the need for reliable detectors. Yet, existing detectors exhibit poor robustness on out-of-distribution (OOD) data and attacked data, which is critical for real-world scenarios. Also, they struggle to provide explainable evidence to support their decisions, thus undermining the reliability. In light of these challenges, we propose IPAD (Inverse Prompt for AI Detection), a novel framework consisting of a Prompt Inverter that identifies predicted prompts that could have generated the input text, and a Distinguisher that examines how well the input texts align with the predicted prompts. We develop and examine two versions of Distinguishers. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that both Distinguishers perform significantly better than the baseline methods, with version2 outperforming baselines by 9.73% on in-distribution data (F1-score) and 12.65% on OOD data (AUROC). Furthermore, a user study is conducted to illustrate that IPAD enhances the AI detection trustworthiness by allowing users to directly examine the decision-making evidence, which provides interpretable support for its state-of-the-art detection results.

      Current financial LLM agent benchmarks are inadequate. They prioritize task performance while ignoring fundamental safety risks. Threats like hallucinations, temporal misalignment, and adversarial vulnerabilities pose systemic risks in high-stakes financial environments, yet existing evaluation frameworks fail to capture these risks. We take a firm position: traditional benchmarks are insufficient to ensure the reliability of LLM agents in finance. To address this, we analyze existing financial LLM agent benchmarks, finding safety gaps and introducing ten risk-aware evaluation metrics. Through an empirical evaluation of both API-based and open-weight LLM agents, we reveal hidden vulnerabilities that remain undetected by conventional assessments. To move the field forward, we propose the Safety-Aware Evaluation Agent (SAEA), grounded in a three-level evaluation framework that assesses agents at the model level (intrinsic capabilities), workflow level (multi-step process reliability), and system level (integration robustness). Our findings highlight the urgent need to redefine LLM agent evaluation standards by shifting the focus from raw performance to safety, robustness, and real world resilience.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in complex reasoning tasks, yet they fall short when tackling more sophisticated challenges, especially when interacting with environments through generating executable actions. This inadequacy primarily stems from the lack of built-in action knowledge in language agents, which fails to effectively guide the planning trajectories during task solving and results in planning hallucination. To address this issue, we introduce KnowAgent, a novel approach designed to enhance the planning capabilities of LLMs by incorporating explicit action knowledge. Specifically, KnowAgent employs an action knowledge base and a knowledgeable self-learning strategy to constrain the action path during planning, enabling more reasonable trajectory synthesis, and thereby enhancing the planning performance of language agents. Experimental results on HotpotQA and ALFWorld based on various backbone models demonstrate that KnowAgent can achieve comparable or superior performance to existing baselines. Further analysis indicates the effectiveness of KnowAgent in terms of planning hallucinations mitigation. Code is available in https://github.com/zjunlp/KnowAgent.

      Adaptive optimizers such as Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2015) have been central to the success of large language models. However, they often require to maintain optimizer states throughout training, which can result in memory requirements several times greater than the model footprint. This overhead imposes constraints on scalability and computational efficiency. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), in contrast, is a stateless optimizer, as it does not track state variables during training. Consequently, it achieves optimal memory efficiency. However, its capability in LLM training is limited (Zhao et al., 2024b). In this work, we show that pre-processing SGD in a stateless manner can achieve the same performance as the Adam optimizer for LLM training, while drastically reducing the memory cost. Specifically, we propose to pre-process the instantaneous stochastic gradients using normalization and whitening. We show that normalization stabilizes gradient distributions, and whitening counteracts the local curvature of the loss landscape. This results in SWAN (SGD with Whitening And Normalization), a stochastic optimizer that eliminates the need to store any optimizer states. Empirically, SWAN has the same memory footprint as SGD, achieving $\approx 50\%$ reduction on total end-to-end memory compared to Adam. In language modeling tasks, SWAN demonstrates comparable or even better performance than Adam: when pre-training the LLaMA model with 350M and 1.3B parameters, SWAN achieves a 2x speedup by reaching the same evaluation perplexity using half as many tokens.

      Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable successes on various natural language tasks. However, recent studies have found that there are still significant challenges to the logical reasoning abilities of LLMs. This paper summarizes and categorizes the main challenges into two aspects: (1) Logical question answering, LLMs often fail to generate the correct answer within complex logical problem which requires sophisticated deductive, inductive or abductive reasoning given a collection of premises and constrains. (2) Logical consistency, LLMs are prone to producing responses contradicting themselves across different questions. For example, a state-of-the-art Macaw question-answering LLM answers Yes to both questions Is a magpie a bird? and Does a bird have wings? but answers No to Does a magpie have wings?. To facilitate this research direction, we comprehensively investigate the most cutting-edge methods and propose detailed taxonomies of these methods. Specifically, to accurately answer complex logic questions, previous methods can be categorized based on reliance on external solvers, prompts, pretraining, and fine-tuning. To avoid logical contradictions, we discuss concepts and solutions of various logical consistencies, including implication, negation, transitivity, factuality consistency, and their composites. In addition, we review commonly used benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics, and discuss promising research directions, such as extensions to modal logic to account for uncertainty, and efficient algorithms satisfying multiple logical consistencies simultaneously.

      Hacking poses a significant threat to cybersecurity, inflicting billions of dollars in damages annually. To mitigate these risks, ethical hacking, or penetration testing, is employed to identify vulnerabilities in systems and networks. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown potential across various domains, including cybersecurity. However, there is currently no comprehensive, open, automated, end-to-end penetration testing benchmark to drive progress and evaluate the capabilities of these models in security contexts. This paper introduces a novel open benchmark for LLM-based automated penetration testing, addressing this critical gap. We first evaluate the performance of LLMs, including GPT-4o and LLama 3.1-405B, using the state-of-the-art PentestGPT tool. Our findings reveal that while LLama 3.1 demonstrates an edge over GPT-4o, both models currently fall short of performing end-to-end penetration testing even with some minimal human assistance. Next, we advance the state-of-the-art and present ablation studies that provide insights into improving the PentestGPT tool. Our research illuminates the challenges LLMs face in each aspect of Pentesting, e.g. enumeration, exploitation, and privilege escalation. This work contributes to the growing body of knowledge on AI-assisted cybersecurity and lays the foundation for future research in automated penetration testing using large language models.

      We introduce Probe Pruning (PP), a novel framework for online, dynamic, structured pruning of Large Language Models (LLMs) applied in a batch-wise manner. PP leverages the insight that not all samples and tokens contribute equally to the model's output, and probing a small portion of each batch effectively identifies crucial weights, enabling tailored dynamic pruning for different batches. It comprises three main stages: probing, history-informed pruning, and full inference. In the probing stage, PP selects a small yet crucial set of hidden states, based on residual importance, to run a few model layers ahead. During the history-informed pruning stage, PP strategically integrates the probing states with historical states. Subsequently, it structurally prunes weights based on the integrated states and the PP importance score, a metric developed specifically to assess the importance of each weight channel in maintaining performance. In the final stage, full inference is conducted on the remaining weights. A major advantage of PP is its compatibility with existing models, as it operates without requiring additional neural network modules or fine-tuning. Comprehensive evaluations of PP on LLaMA-2/3 and OPT models reveal that even minimal probing-using just 1.5% of FLOPs-can substantially enhance the efficiency of structured pruning of LLMs. For instance, when evaluated on LLaMA-2-7B with WikiText2, PP achieves a 2.56 times lower ratio of performance degradation per unit of runtime reduction compared to the state-of-the-art method at a 40% pruning ratio.

However, their capabilities in guiding users to solve complex real-world tasks remain underexplored. To address this limitation, in this work, we focus on coding tutoring, a challenging problem that requires tutors to proactively guide students toward completing predefined coding tasks. We propose a novel agent workflow, Trace-and-Verify (TRAVER), which combines knowledge tracing to estimate a student's knowledge state and turn-by-turn verification to ensure effective guidance toward task completion. We introduce DICT, an automatic evaluation protocol that assesses tutor agents holistically using controlled student simulation and code generation tests. Extensive experiments reveal the challenges of coding tutoring and demonstrate that TRAVER achieves a significantly higher success rate.

However, we show that current LLMs make key decisions in a representation space closest to English, regardless of their input and output languages. Exploring the internal representations with a logit lens for sentences in French, German, Dutch, and Mandarin, we show that the LLM first emits representations close to English for semantically-loaded words before translating them into the target language. We further show that activation steering in these LLMs is more effective when the steering vectors are computed in English rather than in the language of the inputs and outputs. This suggests that multilingual LLMs perform key reasoning steps in a representation that is heavily shaped by English in a way that is not transparent to system users.
