      To reduce memory costs in long-context inference with Large Language Models (LLMs), many recent works focus on compressing the key-value (KV) cache of different tokens. However, we identify that the previous KV cache compression methods measure token importance individually, neglecting the dependency between different tokens in the real-world language characterics. In light of this, we introduce ChunkKV, grouping the tokens in a chunk as a basic compressing unit, and retaining the most informative semantic chunks while discarding the less important ones. Furthermore, observing that ChunkKV exhibits higher similarity in the preserved indices across different layers, we propose layer-wise index reuse to further reduce computational overhead. We evaluated ChunkKV on cutting-edge long-context benchmarks including LongBench and Needle-In-A-HayStack, as well as the GSM8K and JailbreakV in-context learning benchmark. Our experiments with instruction tuning and multi-step reasoning (O1 and R1) LLMs, achieve up to 10\% performance improvement under aggressive compression ratios compared to existing methods.

      In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen remarkable advancements and have been extensively integrated across various fields. Despite their progress, LLMs are prone to hallucinations, producing responses that may not be dependable if the models lack sufficient grounding knowledge. To mitigate this issue, methods for estimating uncertainty have been adopted, with a focus on critical tokens as indicators of reliability. Nevertheless, probability-based approaches have shown limitations in assessing token-level reliability due to the erosion of evidence strength information acquired during training. In this paper, we introduce Logits-induced Token Uncertainty (LogU), a novel framework designed to estimate token-specific uncertainty in LLMs in real time, without the need for multiple sampling rounds. By leveraging evidence modeling for the implementation of LogU, we utilize the derived uncertainty measures to steer downstream tasks. Our experimental findings highlight the substantial effectiveness and potential of LogU, marking a significant advancement in addressing the challenge of model hallucinations.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in natural language processing tasks, yet their massive size makes serving them inefficient and costly. Semi-structured pruning has emerged as an effective method for model acceleration, but existing approaches are suboptimal because they focus on local, layer-wise optimizations using heuristic rules, failing to leverage global feedback. We present ProxSparse, a learning-based framework for mask selection enabled by regularized optimization. ProxSparse transforms the rigid, non-differentiable mask selection process into a smoother optimization procedure, allowing gradual mask exploration with flexibility. ProxSparse does not involve additional weight updates once the mask is determined. Our extensive evaluations on 7 widely used models show that ProxSparse consistently outperforms previously proposed semi-structured mask selection methods with significant improvement, demonstrating the effectiveness of our learned approach towards semi-structured pruning.
