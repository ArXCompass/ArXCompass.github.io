      Large Language Model (LLM) agents frameworks often employ modular architectures, incorporating components such as planning, reasoning, action execution, and reflection to tackle complex tasks. However, quantifying the contribution of each module to overall system performance remains a significant challenge, impeding optimization and interpretability. To address this, we introduce CapaBench (Capability-level Assessment Benchmark), an evaluation framework grounded in cooperative game theory's Shapley Value, which systematically measures the marginal impact of individual modules and their interactions within an agent's architecture. By replacing default modules with test variants across all possible combinations, CapaBench provides a principle method for attributing performance contributions. Key contributions include: (1) We are the first to propose a Shapley Value-based methodology for quantifying the contributions of capabilities in LLM agents; (2) Modules with high Shapley Values consistently lead to predictable performance gains when combined, enabling targeted optimization; and (3) We build a multi-round dataset of over 1,000 entries spanning diverse domains and practical task scenarios, enabling comprehensive evaluation of agent capabilities. CapaBench bridges the gap between component-level evaluation and holistic system assessment, providing actionable insights for optimizing modular LLM agents and advancing their deployment in complex, real-world scenarios.

      Post-training is essential for adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to real-world applications. Deploying post-trained models faces significant challenges due to substantial memory overhead and noticeable inference latency. Existing work has identified significant redundancies in LLMs and proposed efficient architectures, namely intra-layer KV sharing and cross-layer KV sharing. However, intra-layer KV sharing still results in high inference costs, while cross-layer KV sharing leads to significant performance degradation. As a result, both methods remain suboptimal for post-training pre-trained LLMs. In this paper, we identify that the \texttt{Softmax} operation is a primary bottleneck for LLM inference and discover that it is actually highly redundant during post-training. We propose Softmax \textbf{Uni}fication in \textbf{Att}e\textbf{n}tion (\textbf{UniAttn}), a novel post-training method that unifies Softmax activations across transformer blocks to reduce LLM inference costs. Additionally, UniAttn adopts a linear projection to compensate for the errors induced by Softmax unification. Experiments show that UniAttn matches the performance of standard post-training while significantly reducing inference costs, outperforming existing efficient architectures during post-training. Our code will be available at \url{https://github.com/Bostoncake/UniAttn}.

      MarketSenseAI is a novel framework for holistic stock analysis which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to process financial news, historical prices, company fundamentals and the macroeconomic environment to support decision making in stock analysis and selection. In this paper, we present the latest advancements on MarketSenseAI, driven by rapid technological expansion in LLMs. Through a novel architecture combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation and LLM agents, the framework processes SEC filings and earnings calls, while enriching macroeconomic analysis through systematic processing of diverse institutional reports. We demonstrate a significant improvement in fundamental analysis accuracy over the previous version. Empirical evaluation on S\&P 100 stocks over two years (2023-2024) shows MarketSenseAI achieving cumulative returns of 125.9% compared to the index return of 73.5%, while maintaining comparable risk profiles. Further validation on S\&P 500 stocks during 2024 demonstrates the framework's scalability, delivering a 33.8% higher Sortino ratio than the market. This work marks a significant advancement in applying LLM technology to financial analysis, offering insights into the robustness of LLM-driven investment strategies.

      Information removal or suppression in large language models (LLMs) is a desired functionality, useful in AI regulation, legal compliance, safety, and privacy. LLM unlearning methods aim to remove information on demand from LLMs. Current LLM unlearning methods struggle to balance the unlearning efficacy and utility due to the competing nature of these objectives. Keeping the unlearning process computationally feasible without assuming access to the model weights is an overlooked area. We present the first agentic LLM unlearning (ALU) method, a multi-agent, retrain-free, model-agnostic approach to LLM unlearning that achieves effective unlearning while preserving the utility. Our ALU framework unlearns by involving multiple LLM agents, each designed for a specific step in the unlearning process, without the need to update model weights for any of the agents in the framework. Users can easily request any set of unlearning instances in any sequence, and ALU seamlessly adapts in real time. This is facilitated without requiring any changes in the underlying LLM model. Through extensive experiments on established benchmarks (TOFU, WMDP, WPU) and jailbreaking techniques (many shot, target masking, other languages), we demonstrate that ALU consistently stands out as the most robust LLM unlearning framework among current state-of-the-art methods while incurring a low constant-time cost. We further highlight ALU's superior performance compared to existing methods when evaluated at scale. Specifically, ALU is assessed on up to 1000 unlearning targets, exceeding the evaluation scope of all previously proposed LLM unlearning methods.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Recent developments in Large Language Model (LLM) agents are revolutionizing Autonomous Software Engineering (ASE), enabling automated coding, problem fixes, and feature improvements. However, localization -- precisely identifying software problems by navigating to relevant code sections -- remains a significant challenge. Current approaches often yield suboptimal results due to a lack of effective integration between LLM agents and precise code search mechanisms. This paper introduces OrcaLoca, an LLM agent framework that improves accuracy for software issue localization by integrating priority-based scheduling for LLM-guided action, action decomposition with relevance scoring, and distance-aware context pruning. Experimental results demonstrate that OrcaLoca becomes the new open-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) in function match rate (65.33%) on SWE-bench Lite. It also improves the final resolved rate of an open-source framework by 6.33 percentage points through its patch generation integration.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      The pervasiveness of the dissemination of fake news through social media platforms poses critical risks to the trust of the general public, societal stability, and democratic institutions. This challenge calls for novel methodologies in detection, which can keep pace with the dynamic and multi-modal nature of misinformation. Recent works include powering the detection using large language model advances in multimodal frameworks, methodologies using graphs, and adversarial training in the literature of fake news. Based on the different approaches which can bring success, some key highlights will be underlined: enhanced LLM-improves accuracy through more advanced semantics and cross-modality fusion for robust detections. The review further identifies critical gaps in adaptability to dynamic social media trends, real-time, and cross-platform detection capabilities, as well as the ethical challenges thrown up by the misuse of LLMs. Future directions underline the development of style-agnostic models, cross-lingual detection frameworks, and robust policies with a view to mitigating LLM-driven misinformation. This synthesis thus lays a concrete foundation for those researchers and practitioners committed to reinforcing fake news detection systems with complications that keep on growing in the digital landscape.
