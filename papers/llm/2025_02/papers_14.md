      Understanding training dynamics and feature evolution is crucial for the mechanistic interpretability of large language models (LLMs). Although sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have been used to identify features within LLMs, a clear picture of how these features evolve during training remains elusive. In this study, we: (1) introduce SAE-Track, a novel method to efficiently obtain a continual series of SAEs; (2) mechanistically investigate feature formation and develop a progress measure for it ; and (3) analyze and visualize feature drift during training. Our work provides new insights into the dynamics of features in LLMs, enhancing our understanding of training mechanisms and feature evolution.

      Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) strives to accurately pinpoint event timestamps in a specific video using linguistic queries, significantly impacting downstream tasks like video browsing and editing. Unlike traditional task-specific models, Video Large Language Models (video LLMs) can handle multiple tasks concurrently in a zero-shot manner. Consequently, exploring the application of video LLMs for VTG tasks has become a burgeoning research area. However, despite considerable advancements in video content understanding, video LLMs often struggle to accurately pinpoint timestamps within videos, limiting their effectiveness in VTG tasks. To address this, we introduce VTG-LLM, a model designed to enhance video LLMs' timestamp localization abilities. Our approach includes: (1) effectively integrating timestamp knowledge into visual tokens; (2) incorporating absolute-time tokens to manage timestamp knowledge without concept shifts; and (3) introducing a lightweight, high-performance, slot-based token compression technique designed to accommodate the demands of a large number of frames to be sampled for VTG tasks. Additionally, we present VTG-IT-120K, a collection of publicly available VTG datasets that we have re-annotated to improve upon low-quality annotations. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of VTG-LLM in comparison to other video LLM methods across a variety of VTG tasks.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance at zero-shot generation of abstractive summaries for given articles. However, little is known about the robustness of such a process of zero-shot summarization. To bridge this gap, we propose relevance paraphrasing, a simple strategy that can be used to measure the robustness of LLMs as summarizers. The relevance paraphrasing approach identifies the most relevant sentences that contribute to generating an ideal summary, and then paraphrases these inputs to obtain a minimally perturbed dataset. Then, by evaluating model performance for summarization on both the original and perturbed datasets, we can assess the LLM's one aspect of robustness. We conduct extensive experiments with relevance paraphrasing on 4 diverse datasets, as well as 4 LLMs of different sizes (GPT-3.5-Turbo, Llama-2-13B, Mistral-7B, and Dolly-v2-7B). Our results indicate that LLMs are not consistent summarizers for the minimally perturbed articles, necessitating further improvements.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a range of natural language processing tasks. In particular, improvements in reasoning abilities and the expansion of context windows have opened new avenues for leveraging these powerful models. NL2SQL is challenging in that the natural language question is inherently ambiguous, while the SQL generation requires a precise understanding of complex data schema and semantics. One approach to this semantic ambiguous problem is to provide more and sufficient contextual information. In this work, we explore the performance and the latency trade-offs of the extended context window (a.k.a., long context) offered by Google's state-of-the-art LLM (\textit{gemini-1.5-pro}). We study the impact of various contextual information, including column example values, question and SQL query pairs, user-provided hints, SQL documentation, and schema. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study how the extended context window and extra contextual information can help NL2SQL generation with respect to both accuracy and latency cost. We show that long context LLMs are robust and do not get lost in the extended contextual information. Additionally, our long-context NL2SQL pipeline based on Google's \textit{gemini-pro-1.5} achieve strong performances on various benchmark datasets without finetuning and expensive self-consistency based techniques.

      Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities. However, single-shot inference often yields unreliable results for complex reasoning tasks, leading researchers to explore multiple reasoning paths through methods such as perplexity and self-consistency. In this paper, we present the first theoretical error decomposition analysis of these techniques, breaking down their error into estimation error and model error. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off: perplexity methods suffer from substantial model error due to the absence of a proper consistency function, while self-consistency exhibits high estimation error due to a slow error convergence rate. To overcome these limitations, we propose Reasoning-Pruning Perplexity Consistency (RPC). This approach combines Perplexity Consistency, which seamlessly integrates LLM perplexity with self-consistency, and Reasoning Pruning, which eliminates low-probability reasoning paths to effectively prevent the degeneration of estimation error reduction. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that RPC not only accelerates the convergence rate of estimation error to an exponential level but also holds strong potential for further reducing model error. Extensive empirical evaluations on seven benchmark datasets confirm that RPC can significantly improve reasoning performance, sample efficiency, and confidence reliability.

      Large Language Model (LLM) agents frameworks often employ modular architectures, incorporating components such as planning, reasoning, action execution, and reflection to tackle complex tasks. However, quantifying the contribution of each module to overall system performance remains a significant challenge, impeding optimization and interpretability. To address this, we introduce CapaBench (Capability-level Assessment Benchmark), an evaluation framework grounded in cooperative game theory's Shapley Value, which systematically measures the marginal impact of individual modules and their interactions within an agent's architecture. By replacing default modules with test variants across all possible combinations, CapaBench provides a principle method for attributing performance contributions. Key contributions include: (1) We are the first to propose a Shapley Value-based methodology for quantifying the contributions of capabilities in LLM agents; (2) Modules with high Shapley Values consistently lead to predictable performance gains when combined, enabling targeted optimization; and (3) We build a multi-round dataset of over 1,000 entries spanning diverse domains and practical task scenarios, enabling comprehensive evaluation of agent capabilities. CapaBench bridges the gap between component-level evaluation and holistic system assessment, providing actionable insights for optimizing modular LLM agents and advancing their deployment in complex, real-world scenarios.

      Post-training is essential for adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to real-world applications. Deploying post-trained models faces significant challenges due to substantial memory overhead and noticeable inference latency. Existing work has identified significant redundancies in LLMs and proposed efficient architectures, namely intra-layer KV sharing and cross-layer KV sharing. However, intra-layer KV sharing still results in high inference costs, while cross-layer KV sharing leads to significant performance degradation. As a result, both methods remain suboptimal for post-training pre-trained LLMs. In this paper, we identify that the \texttt{Softmax} operation is a primary bottleneck for LLM inference and discover that it is actually highly redundant during post-training. We propose Softmax \textbf{Uni}fication in \textbf{Att}e\textbf{n}tion (\textbf{UniAttn}), a novel post-training method that unifies Softmax activations across transformer blocks to reduce LLM inference costs. Additionally, UniAttn adopts a linear projection to compensate for the errors induced by Softmax unification. Experiments show that UniAttn matches the performance of standard post-training while significantly reducing inference costs, outperforming existing efficient architectures during post-training.

      MarketSenseAI is a novel framework for holistic stock analysis which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to process financial news, historical prices, company fundamentals and the macroeconomic environment to support decision making in stock analysis and selection. In this paper, we present the latest advancements on MarketSenseAI, driven by rapid technological expansion in LLMs. Through a novel architecture combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation and LLM agents, the framework processes SEC filings and earnings calls, while enriching macroeconomic analysis through systematic processing of diverse institutional reports. We demonstrate a significant improvement in fundamental analysis accuracy over the previous version. Empirical evaluation on S\&P 100 stocks over two years (2023-2024) shows MarketSenseAI achieving cumulative returns of 125.9% compared to the index return of 73.5%, while maintaining comparable risk profiles. Further validation on S\&P 500 stocks during 2024 demonstrates the framework's scalability, delivering a 33.8% higher Sortino ratio than the market.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Information removal or suppression in large language models (LLMs) is a desired functionality, useful in AI regulation, legal compliance, safety, and privacy. LLM unlearning methods aim to remove information on demand from LLMs. Current LLM unlearning methods struggle to balance the unlearning efficacy and utility due to the competing nature of these objectives. Keeping the unlearning process computationally feasible without assuming access to the model weights is an overlooked area. We present the first agentic LLM unlearning (ALU) method, a multi-agent, retrain-free, model-agnostic approach to LLM unlearning that achieves effective unlearning while preserving the utility. Our ALU framework unlearns by involving multiple LLM agents, each designed for a specific step in the unlearning process, without the need to update model weights for any of the agents in the framework. Users can easily request any set of unlearning instances in any sequence, and ALU seamlessly adapts in real time. This is facilitated without requiring any changes in the underlying LLM model. Through extensive experiments on established benchmarks (TOFU, WMDP, WPU) and jailbreaking techniques (many shot, target masking, other languages), we demonstrate that ALU consistently stands out as the most robust LLM unlearning framework among current state-of-the-art methods while incurring a low constant-time cost. We further highlight ALU's superior performance compared to existing methods when evaluated at scale. Specifically, ALU is assessed on up to 1000 unlearning targets, exceeding the evaluation scope of all previously proposed LLM unlearning methods.

      Recent developments in Large Language Model (LLM) agents are revolutionizing Autonomous Software Engineering (ASE), enabling automated coding, problem fixes, and feature improvements. However, localization -- precisely identifying software problems by navigating to relevant code sections -- remains a significant challenge. Current approaches often yield suboptimal results due to a lack of effective integration between LLM agents and precise code search mechanisms. This paper introduces OrcaLoca, an LLM agent framework that improves accuracy for software issue localization by integrating priority-based scheduling for LLM-guided action, action decomposition with relevance scoring, and distance-aware context pruning. Experimental results demonstrate that OrcaLoca becomes the new open-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) in function match rate (65.33%) on SWE-bench Lite. It also improves the final resolved rate of an open-source framework by 6.33 percentage points through its patch generation integration.

      The pervasiveness of the dissemination of fake news through social media platforms poses critical risks to the trust of the general public, societal stability, and democratic institutions. This challenge calls for novel methodologies in detection, which can keep pace with the dynamic and multi-modal nature of misinformation. Recent works include powering the detection using large language model advances in multimodal frameworks, methodologies using graphs, and adversarial training in the literature of fake news. Based on the different approaches which can bring success, some key highlights will be underlined: enhanced LLM-improves accuracy through more advanced semantics and cross-modality fusion for robust detections. The review further identifies critical gaps in adaptability to dynamic social media trends, real-time, and cross-platform detection capabilities, as well as the ethical challenges thrown up by the misuse of LLMs. Future directions underline the development of style-agnostic models, cross-lingual detection frameworks, and robust policies with a view to mitigating LLM-driven misinformation. This synthesis thus lays a concrete foundation for those researchers and practitioners committed to reinforcing fake news detection systems with complications that keep on growing in the digital landscape.

      To reduce memory costs in long-context inference with Large Language Models (LLMs), many recent works focus on compressing the key-value (KV) cache of different tokens. However, we identify that the previous KV cache compression methods measure token importance individually, neglecting the dependency between different tokens in the real-world language characterics. In light of this, we introduce ChunkKV, grouping the tokens in a chunk as a basic compressing unit, and retaining the most informative semantic chunks while discarding the less important ones. Furthermore, observing that ChunkKV exhibits higher similarity in the preserved indices across different layers, we propose layer-wise index reuse to further reduce computational overhead. We evaluated ChunkKV on cutting-edge long-context benchmarks including LongBench and Needle-In-A-HayStack, as well as the GSM8K and JailbreakV in-context learning benchmark. Our experiments with instruction tuning and multi-step reasoning (O1 and R1) LLMs, achieve up to 10\% performance improvement under aggressive compression ratios compared to existing methods.

      In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen remarkable advancements and have been extensively integrated across various fields. Despite their progress, LLMs are prone to hallucinations, producing responses that may not be dependable if the models lack sufficient grounding knowledge. To mitigate this issue, methods for estimating uncertainty have been adopted, with a focus on critical tokens as indicators of reliability. Nevertheless, probability-based approaches have shown limitations in assessing token-level reliability due to the erosion of evidence strength information acquired during training. In this paper, we introduce Logits-induced Token Uncertainty (LogU), a novel framework designed to estimate token-specific uncertainty in LLMs in real time, without the need for multiple sampling rounds. By leveraging evidence modeling for the implementation of LogU, we utilize the derived uncertainty measures to steer downstream tasks. Our experimental findings highlight the substantial effectiveness and potential of LogU, marking a significant advancement in addressing the challenge of model hallucinations.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in natural language processing tasks, yet their massive size makes serving them inefficient and costly. Semi-structured pruning has emerged as an effective method for model acceleration, but existing approaches are suboptimal because they focus on local, layer-wise optimizations using heuristic rules, failing to leverage global feedback. We present ProxSparse, a learning-based framework for mask selection enabled by regularized optimization. ProxSparse transforms the rigid, non-differentiable mask selection process into a smoother optimization procedure, allowing gradual mask exploration with flexibility. ProxSparse does not involve additional weight updates once the mask is determined. Our extensive evaluations on 7 widely used models show that ProxSparse consistently outperforms previously proposed semi-structured mask selection methods with significant improvement, demonstrating the effectiveness of our learned approach towards semi-structured pruning.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) by delivering state-of-the-art performance across a variety of tasks. Among these, Transformer-based models like BERT and GPT rely on pooling layers to aggregate token-level embeddings into sentence-level representations. Common pooling mechanisms such as Mean, Max, and Weighted Sum play a pivotal role in this aggregation process. Despite their widespread use, the comparative performance of these strategies on different LLM architectures remains underexplored. To address this gap, this paper investigates the effects of these pooling mechanisms on two prominent LLM families -- BERT and GPT, in the context of sentence-level sentiment analysis. Comprehensive experiments reveal that each pooling mechanism exhibits unique strengths and weaknesses depending on the task's specific requirements. Our findings underline the importance of selecting pooling methods tailored to the demands of particular applications, prompting a re-evaluation of common assumptions regarding pooling operations. By offering actionable insights, this study contributes to the optimization of LLM-based models for downstream tasks.

      Quantized training of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains an open challenge, as maintaining accuracy while performing all matrix multiplications in low precision has proven difficult. This is particularly the case when fine-tuning pre-trained models, which can have large weight and activation outlier values that make lower-precision optimization difficult. To address this, we present HALO, a novel quantization-aware training approach for Transformers that enables accurate and efficient low-precision training by combining 1) strategic placement of Hadamard rotations in both forward and backward passes, which mitigate outliers, 2) high-performance kernel support, and 3) FSDP integration for low-precision communication. Our approach ensures that all large matrix multiplications during the forward and backward passes are executed in lower precision. Applied to LLAMA-family models, HALO achieves near-full-precision-equivalent results during fine-tuning on various tasks, while delivering up to 1.41x end-to-end speedup for full fine-tuning on RTX 4090 GPUs. HALO efficiently supports both standard and parameterefficient fine-tuning (PEFT). Our results demonstrate the first practical approach to fully quantized LLM fine-tuning that maintains accuracy in 8-bit precision, while delivering performance benefits.

      Scientific team dynamics are critical in determining the nature and impact of research outputs. However, existing methods for classifying author roles based on self-reports and clustering lack comprehensive contextual analysis of contributions. Thus, we present a transformative approach to classifying author roles in scientific teams using advanced large language models (LLMs), which offers a more refined analysis compared to traditional clustering methods. Specifically, we seek to complement and enhance these traditional methods by utilizing open source and proprietary LLMs, such as GPT-4, Llama3 70B, Llama2 70B, and Mistral 7x8B, for role classification. Utilizing few-shot prompting, we categorize author roles and demonstrate that GPT-4 outperforms other models across multiple categories, surpassing traditional approaches such as XGBoost and BERT. Our methodology also includes building a predictive deep learning model using 10 features. By training this model on a dataset derived from the OpenAlex database, which provides detailed metadata on academic publications -- such as author-publication history, author affiliation, research topics, and citation counts -- we achieve an F1 score of 0.76, demonstrating robust classification of author roles.
