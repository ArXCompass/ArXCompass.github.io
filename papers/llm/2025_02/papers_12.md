    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to assess news credibility, yet little is known about how they make these judgments. While prior research has examined political bias in LLM outputs or their potential for automated fact-checking, their internal evaluation processes remain largely unexamined. Understanding how LLMs assess credibility provides insights into AI behavior and how credibility is structured and applied in large-scale language models. This study benchmarks the reliability and political classifications of state-of-the-art LLMs - Gemini 1.5 Flash (Google), GPT-4o mini (OpenAI), and LLaMA 3.1 (Meta) - against structured, expert-driven rating systems such as NewsGuard and Media Bias Fact Check. Beyond assessing classification performance, we analyze the linguistic markers that shape LLM decisions, identifying which words and concepts drive their evaluations. We uncover patterns in how LLMs associate credibility with specific linguistic features by examining keyword frequency, contextual determinants, and rank distributions. Beyond static classification, we introduce a framework in which LLMs refine their credibility assessments by retrieving external information, querying other models, and adapting their responses. This allows us to investigate whether their assessments reflect structured reasoning or rely primarily on prior learned associations.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      KV cache quantization can improve Large Language Models (LLMs) inference throughput and latency in long contexts and large batch-size scenarios while preserving LLMs effectiveness. However, current methods have three unsolved issues: overlooking layer-wise sensitivity to KV cache quantization, high overhead of online fine-grained decision-making, and low flexibility to different LLMs and constraints. Therefore, we thoroughly analyze the inherent correlation of layer-wise transformer attention patterns to KV cache quantization errors and study why key cache is more important than value cache for quantization error reduction. We further propose a simple yet effective framework KVTuner to adaptively search for the optimal hardware-friendly layer-wise KV quantization precision pairs for coarse-grained KV cache with multi-objective optimization and directly utilize the offline searched configurations during online inference. To reduce the computational cost of offline calibration, we utilize the intra-layer KV precision pair pruning and inter-layer clustering to reduce the search space. Experimental results show that we can achieve nearly lossless 3.25-bit mixed precision KV cache quantization for LLMs like Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and 4.0-bit for sensitive models like Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on mathematical reasoning tasks. The maximum inference throughput can be improved by 38.3% compared with KV8 quantization over various context lengths.

      Generating synthetic datasets via large language models (LLMs) themselves has emerged as a promising approach to improve LLM performance. However, LLMs inherently reflect biases present in their training data, leading to a critical challenge: when these models generate synthetic data for training, they may propagate and amplify their inherent biases that can significantly impact model fairness and robustness on downstream tasks--a phenomenon we term bias inheritance. This work presents the first systematic investigation in understanding, analyzing, and mitigating bias inheritance. We study this problem by fine-tuning LLMs with a combined dataset consisting of original and LLM-augmented data, where bias ratio represents the proportion of augmented data. Through systematic experiments across 10 classification and generation tasks, we analyze how 6 different types of biases manifest at varying bias ratios. Our results reveal that bias inheritance has nuanced effects on downstream tasks, influencing both classification tasks and generation tasks differently. Then, our analysis identifies three key misalignment factors: misalignment of values, group data, and data distributions. Based on these insights, we propose three mitigation strategies: token-based, mask-based, and loss-based approaches. Experiments demonstrate that these strategies also work differently on various tasks and bias, indicating the substantial challenges to fully mitigate bias inheritance. We hope this work can provide valuable insights to the research of LLM data augmentation.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance by scaling model parameters, but this comes with significant inference overhead. Feed-forward networks (FFNs), which dominate LLM parameters, exhibit high activation sparsity in hidden neurons. To exploit this, researchers have proposed using a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture, where only a subset of parameters is activated. However, existing approaches often require extensive training data and resources, limiting their practicality. We propose CMoE (Carved MoE), a novel framework to efficiently carve MoE models from dense models. CMoE achieves remarkable performance through efficient expert grouping and lightweight adaptation. First, neurons are grouped into shared and routed experts based on activation rates. Next, we construct a routing mechanism without training from scratch, incorporating a differentiable routing process and load balancing. Using modest data, CMoE produces a well-designed, usable MoE from a 7B dense model within five minutes. With lightweight fine-tuning, it achieves high-performance recovery in under an hour. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/JarvisPei/CMoE.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Groundbreaking advancements in text-to-image generation have recently been achieved with the emergence of diffusion models. These models exhibit a remarkable ability to generate highly artistic and intricately detailed images based on textual prompts. However, obtaining desired generation outcomes often necessitates repetitive trials of manipulating text prompts just like casting spells on a magic mirror, and the reason behind that is the limited capability of semantic understanding inherent in current image generation models. Specifically, existing diffusion models encode the text prompt input with a pre-trained encoder structure, which is usually trained on a limited number of image-caption pairs. The state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) based on the decoder-only structure have shown a powerful semantic understanding capability as their architectures are more suitable for training on very large-scale unlabeled data. In this work, we propose to enhance text-to-image diffusion models by borrowing the strength of semantic understanding from large language models, and devise a simple yet effective adapter to allow the diffusion models to be compatible with the decoder-only structure. Meanwhile, we also provide a supporting theoretical analysis with various architectures (e.g., encoder-only, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only), and conduct extensive empirical evaluations to verify its effectiveness. The experimental results show that the enhanced models with our adapter module are superior to the stat-of-the-art models in terms of text-to-image generation quality and reliability.

      Model merging aggregates Large Language Models (LLMs) finetuned on different tasks into a stronger one. However, parameter conflicts between models leads to performance degradation in averaging. While model routing addresses this issue by selecting individual models during inference, it imposes excessive storage and compute costs, and fails to leverage the common knowledge from different models. In this work, we observe that different layers exhibit varying levels of parameter conflicts. Building on this insight, we average layers with minimal parameter conflicts and use a novel task-level expert routing for layers with significant conflicts. To further reduce storage costs, inspired by task arithmetic sparsity, we decouple multiple fine-tuned experts into a dense expert and several sparse experts. Considering the out-of-distribution samples, we select and merge appropriate experts based on the task uncertainty of the input data. We conduct extensive experiments on both LLaMA and Qwen with varying parameter scales, and evaluate on real-world reasoning tasks. Results demonstrate that our method consistently achieves significant performance improvements while requiring less system cost compared to existing methods.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease affecting 50 million people worldwide. Low-cost, accurate identification of key markers of AD is crucial for timely diagnosis and intervention. Language impairment is one of the earliest signs of cognitive decline, which can be used to discriminate AD patients from normal control individuals. Patient-interviewer dialogues may be used to detect such impairments, but they are often mixed with ambiguous, noisy, and irrelevant information, making the AD detection task difficult. Moreover, the limited availability of AD speech samples and variability in their speech styles pose significant challenges in developing robust speech-based AD detection models. To address these challenges, we propose DECT, a novel speech-based domain-specific approach leveraging large language models (LLMs) for fine-grained linguistic analysis and label-switched label-preserved data generation. Our study presents four novelties: We harness the summarizing capabilities of LLMs to identify and distill key Cognitive-Linguistic information from noisy speech transcripts, effectively filtering irrelevant information. We leverage the inherent linguistic knowledge of LLMs to extract linguistic markers from unstructured and heterogeneous audio transcripts. We exploit the compositional ability of LLMs to generate AD speech transcripts consisting of diverse linguistic patterns to overcome the speech data scarcity challenge and enhance the robustness of AD detection models. We use the augmented AD textual speech transcript dataset and a more fine-grained representation of AD textual speech transcript data to fine-tune the AD detection model. The results have shown that DECT demonstrates superior model performance with an 11% improvement in AD detection accuracy on the datasets from DementiaBank compared to the baselines.

      Effective asynchronous planning, or the ability to efficiently reason and plan over states and actions that must happen in parallel or sequentially, is essential for agents that must account for time delays, reason over diverse long-horizon tasks, and collaborate with other agents. While large language model (LLM) agents show promise in high-level task planning, current benchmarks focus primarily on short-horizon tasks and do not evaluate such asynchronous planning capabilities. We introduce Robotouille, a challenging benchmark environment designed to test LLM agents' ability to handle long-horizon asynchronous scenarios. Our synchronous and asynchronous datasets capture increasingly complex planning challenges that go beyond existing benchmarks, requiring agents to manage overlapping tasks and interruptions. Our results show that ReAct (gpt4-o) achieves 47% on synchronous tasks but only 11% on asynchronous tasks, highlighting significant room for improvement. We further analyze failure modes, demonstrating the need for LLM agents to better incorporate long-horizon feedback and self-audit their reasoning during task execution.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significantly advanced capabilities in understanding and generating human language text, which have gained increasing popularity over recent years. Apart from their state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) performance, considering their widespread usage in many industries, including medicine, finance, education, etc., security concerns over their usage grow simultaneously. In recent years, the evolution of backdoor attacks has progressed with the advancement of defense mechanisms against them and more well-developed features in the LLMs. In this paper, we adapt the general taxonomy for classifying machine learning attacks on one of the subdivisions - training-time white-box backdoor attacks. Besides systematically classifying attack methods, we also consider the corresponding defense methods against backdoor attacks. By providing an extensive summary of existing works, we hope this survey can serve as a guideline for inspiring future research that further extends the attack scenarios and creates a stronger defense against them for more robust LLMs.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Despite extensive safety alignment efforts, large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that elicit harmful behavior. While existing studies predominantly focus on attack methods that require technical expertise, two critical questions remain underexplored: (1) Are jailbroken responses truly useful in enabling average users to carry out harmful actions? (2) Do safety vulnerabilities exist in more common, simple human-LLM interactions? In this paper, we demonstrate that LLM responses most effectively facilitate harmful actions when they are both actionable and informative--two attributes easily elicited in multi-step, multilingual interactions. Using this insight, we propose HarmScore, a jailbreak metric that measures how effectively an LLM response enables harmful actions, and Speak Easy, a simple multi-step, multilingual attack framework. Notably, by incorporating Speak Easy into direct request and jailbreak baselines, we see an average absolute increase of 0.319 in Attack Success Rate and 0.426 in HarmScore in both open-source and proprietary LLMs across four safety benchmarks. Our work reveals a critical yet often overlooked vulnerability: Malicious users can easily exploit common interaction patterns for harmful intentions.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant capability across various tasks, with their real-world effectiveness often driven by prompt design. While recent research has focused on optimizing prompt content, the role of prompt formatting, a critical but often overlooked dimension, has received limited systematic investigation. In this paper, we introduce Content-Format Integrated Prompt Optimization (CFPO), an innovative methodology that jointly optimizes both prompt content and formatting through an iterative refinement process. CFPO leverages natural language mutations to explore content variations and employs a dynamic format exploration strategy that systematically evaluates diverse format options. Our extensive evaluations across multiple tasks and open-source LLMs demonstrate that CFPO demonstrates measurable performance improvements compared to content-only optimization methods. This highlights the importance of integrated content-format optimization and offers a practical, model-agnostic approach to enhancing LLM performance.

      Jailbreak attacks against large language models (LLMs) aim to induce harmful behaviors in LLMs through carefully crafted adversarial prompts. To mitigate attacks, one way is to perform adversarial training (AT)-based alignment, i.e., training LLMs on some of the most adversarial prompts to help them learn how to behave safely under attacks. During AT, the length of adversarial prompts plays a critical role in the robustness of aligned LLMs. This paper focuses on adversarial suffix jailbreak attacks and unveils that to defend against a jailbreak attack with an adversarial suffix of length $\Theta(M)$, it is enough to align LLMs on prompts with adversarial suffixes of length $\Theta(\sqrt{M})$. Theoretically, we analyze the adversarial in-context learning of linear transformers on linear regression tasks and prove a robust generalization bound for trained transformers. The bound depends on the term $\Theta(\sqrt{M_{\text{test}}}/M_{\text{train}})$, where $M_{\text{train}}$ and $M_{\text{test}}$ are the number of adversarially perturbed in-context samples during training and testing. Empirically, we conduct AT on popular open-source LLMs and evaluate their robustness against jailbreak attacks of different adversarial suffix lengths. Results confirm a positive correlation between the attack success rate and the ratio of the square root of the adversarial suffix during jailbreaking to the length during AT. Our findings show that it is practical to defend "long-length" jailbreak attacks via efficient "short-length" AT. The code is available at https://github.com/fshp971/adv-icl.

      Recent studies have highlighted the presence of cultural biases in Large Language Models (LLMs), yet often lack a robust methodology to dissect these phenomena comprehensively. Our work aims to bridge this gap by delving into the Food domain, a universally relevant yet culturally diverse aspect of human life. We introduce FmLAMA, a multilingual dataset centered on food-related cultural facts and variations in food practices. We analyze LLMs across various architectures and configurations, evaluating their performance in both monolingual and multilingual settings. By leveraging templates in six different languages, we investigate how LLMs interact with language-specific and cultural knowledge. Our findings reveal that (1) LLMs demonstrate a pronounced bias towards food knowledge prevalent in the United States; (2) Incorporating relevant cultural context significantly improves LLMs' ability to access cultural knowledge; (3) The efficacy of LLMs in capturing cultural nuances is highly dependent on the interplay between the probing language, the specific model architecture, and the cultural context in question. This research underscores the complexity of integrating cultural understanding into LLMs and emphasizes the importance of culturally diverse datasets to mitigate biases and enhance model performance across different cultural domains.

      As large language models (LLMs) become integral to diverse applications, ensuring their reliability under varying input conditions is crucial. One key issue affecting this reliability is order sensitivity, wherein slight variations in input arrangement can lead to inconsistent or biased outputs. Although recent advances have reduced this sensitivity, the problem remains unresolved. This paper investigates the extent of order sensitivity in closed-source LLMs by conducting experiments across multiple tasks, including paraphrasing, relevance judgment, and multiple-choice questions. Our results show that input order significantly affects performance across tasks, with shuffled inputs leading to measurable declines in output accuracy. Few-shot prompting demonstrates mixed effectiveness and offers partial mitigation, however, fails to fully resolve the problem. These findings highlight persistent risks, particularly in high-stakes applications, and point to the need for more robust LLMs or improved input-handling techniques in future development.

      This work presents a custom approach to developing a domain specific knowledge assistant for sustainability reporting using the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). In this domain, there is no publicly available question-answer dataset, which has impeded the development of a high-quality chatbot to support companies with IFRS reporting. The two key contributions of this project therefore are: (1) A high-quality synthetic question-answer (QA) dataset based on IFRS sustainability standards, created using a novel generation and evaluation pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). This comprises 1,063 diverse QA pairs that address a wide spectrum of potential user queries in sustainability reporting. Various LLM-based techniques are employed to create the dataset, including chain-of-thought reasoning and few-shot prompting. A custom evaluation framework is developed to assess question and answer quality across multiple dimensions, including faithfulness, relevance, and domain specificity. The dataset averages a score range of 8.16 out of 10 on these metrics. (2) Two architectures for question-answering in the sustainability reporting domain - a RAG pipeline and a fully LLM-based pipeline. The architectures are developed by experimenting, fine-tuning, and training on the QA dataset. The final pipelines feature an LLM fine-tuned on domain specific data and an industry classification component to improve the handling of complex queries. The RAG architecture achieves an accuracy of 85.32% on single-industry and 72.15% on cross-industry multiple-choice questions, outperforming the baseline approach by 4.67 and 19.21 percentage points, respectively. The LLM-based pipeline achieves an accuracy of 93.45% on single-industry and 80.30% on cross-industry multiple-choice questions, an improvement of 12.80 and 27.36 percentage points over the baseline, respectively.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      With the development of large language models (LLMs), efficient inference through Key-Value (KV) cache compression has attracted considerable attention, especially for long-context generation. To compress the KV cache, recent methods identify critical KV tokens through heuristic ranking with attention scores. However, these methods often struggle to accurately determine critical tokens as they neglect the \textit{temporal patterns} in attention scores, resulting in a noticeable degradation in LLM performance. To address this challenge, we propose AttentionPredictor, which is the first learning-based critical token identification approach. Specifically, AttentionPredictor learns a lightweight convolution model to capture spatiotemporal patterns and predict the next-token attention score. An appealing feature of AttentionPredictor is that it accurately predicts the attention score while consuming negligible memory. Moreover, we propose a cross-token critical cache prefetching framework that hides the token estimation time overhead to accelerate the decoding stage. By retaining most of the attention information, AttentionPredictor achieves 16$\times$ KV cache compression with comparable LLM performance, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art.

      Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated immense utility across various industries. However, as LLMs advance, the risk of harmful outputs increases due to incorrect or malicious instruction prompts. While current methods effectively address jailbreak risks, they share common limitations: 1) Judging harmful responses from the prefill-level lacks utilization of the model's decoding outputs, leading to relatively lower effectiveness and robustness. 2) Rejecting potentially harmful responses based on a single evaluation can significantly impair the model's helpfulness.This paper examines the LLMs' capability to recognize harmful outputs, revealing and quantifying their proficiency in assessing the danger of previous tokens. Motivated by pilot experiment results, we design a robust defense mechanism at the decoding level. Our novel decoder-oriented, step-by-step defense architecture corrects harmful queries directly rather than rejecting them outright. We introduce speculative decoding to enhance usability and facilitate deployment to boost secure decoding speed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach improves model security without compromising reasoning speed. Notably, our method leverages the model's ability to discern hazardous information, maintaining its helpfulness compared to existing methods.

We test Ministral-8B, DeepSeek-V3, and GPT-4, finding that the latter two have reasonable agreement with humans and each other. We conclude that this approach is more cost-effective and similarly robust compared to a fine-grained multi-class approach, allowing automated quantity estimation across species.

      Vehicle API testing verifies whether the interactions between a vehicle's internal systems and external applications meet expectations, ensuring that users can access and control various vehicle functions and data. However, this task is inherently complex, requiring the alignment and coordination of API systems, communication protocols, and even vehicle simulation systems to develop valid test cases. In practical industrial scenarios, inconsistencies, ambiguities, and interdependencies across various documents and system specifications pose significant challenges. This paper presents a system designed for the automated testing of in-vehicle APIs. By clearly defining and segmenting the testing process, we enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to focus on specific tasks, ensuring a stable and controlled testing workflow. Experiments conducted on over 100 APIs demonstrate that our system effectively automates vehicle API testing. The results also confirm that LLMs can efficiently handle mundane tasks requiring human judgment, making them suitable for complete automation in similar industrial contexts.

      Large language models (LLMs) have attracted significant attention in recommendation systems. Current work primarily applies supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to adapt the model for recommendation tasks. However, SFT on positive examples only limits the model's ability to align with user preference. To address this, researchers recently introduced Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which explicitly aligns LLMs with user preferences using offline preference ranking data. However, we found that DPO inherently biases the model towards a few items, exacerbating the filter bubble issue and ultimately degrading user experience. In this paper, we propose SPRec, a novel self-play framework designed to mitigate over-recommendation and improve fairness without requiring additional data or manual intervention. In each self-play iteration, the model undergoes an SFT step followed by a DPO step, treating offline interaction data as positive samples and the predicted outputs from the previous iteration as negative samples. This effectively re-weights the DPO loss function using the model's logits, adaptively suppressing biased items. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate SPRec's effectiveness in enhancing recommendation accuracy and fairness.

      Massive activations, which manifest in specific feature dimensions of hidden states, introduce a significant bias in large language models (LLMs), leading to an overemphasis on the corresponding token. In this paper, we identify that massive activations originate not from the hidden state but from the intermediate state of a feed-forward network module in an early layer. Expanding on the previous observation that massive activations occur only in specific feature dimensions, we dive deep into the weights that cause massive activations. Specifically, we define top-$k$ massive weights as the weights that contribute to the dimensions with the top-$k$ magnitudes in the intermediate state. When these massive weights are set to zero, the functionality of LLMs is entirely disrupted. However, when all weights except for massive weights are set to zero, it results in a relatively minor performance drop, even though a much larger number of weights are set to zero. This implies that during the pre-training process, learning is dominantly focused on massive weights. Building on this observation, we propose a simple plug-and-play method called MacDrop (massive weights curriculum dropout), to rely less on massive weights during parameter-efficient fine-tuning. This method applies dropout to the pre-trained massive weights, starting with a high dropout probability and gradually decreasing it as fine-tuning progresses. Through various experiments, including zero-shot downstream tasks, long-context tasks, and ablation studies, we demonstrate that \texttt{MacDrop} generally improves performance and strengthens robustness.

      Relevance modeling between queries and items stands as a pivotal component in commercial search engines, directly affecting the user experience. Given the remarkable achievements of large language models (LLMs) in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, LLM-based relevance modeling is gradually being adopted within industrial search systems. Nevertheless, foundational LLMs lack domain-specific knowledge and do not fully exploit the potential of in-context learning. Furthermore, structured item text remains underutilized, and there is a shortage in the supply of corresponding queries and background knowledge. We thereby propose CPRM (Continual Pre-training for Relevance Modeling), a framework designed for the continual pre-training of LLMs to address these issues. Our CPRM framework includes three modules: 1) employing both queries and multi-field item to jointly pre-train for enhancing domain knowledge, 2) applying in-context pre-training, a novel approach where LLMs are pre-trained on a sequence of related queries or items, and 3) conducting reading comprehension on items to produce associated domain knowledge and background information (e.g., generating summaries and corresponding queries) to further strengthen LLMs. Results on offline experiments and online A/B testing demonstrate that our model achieves convincing performance compared to strong baselines.

      Despite the fact that large language models (LLMs) show exceptional skill in instruction following tasks, this strength can turn into a vulnerability when the models are required to disregard certain instructions. Instruction-following tasks typically involve a clear task description and input text containing the target data to be processed. However, when the input itself resembles an instruction, confusion may arise, even if there is explicit prompting to distinguish between the task instruction and the input. We refer to this phenomenon as instructional distraction. In this paper, we introduce a novel benchmark, named DIM-Bench, specifically designed to assess LLMs' performance under instructional distraction. The benchmark categorizes real-world instances of instructional distraction and evaluates LLMs across four instruction tasks: rewriting, proofreading, translation, and style transfer -- alongside five input tasks: reasoning, code generation, mathematical reasoning, bias detection, and question answering. Our experimental results reveal that even the most advanced LLMs are susceptible to instructional distraction, often failing to accurately follow user intent in such cases.

      Jailbreak attacks exploit specific prompts to bypass LLM safeguards, causing the LLM to generate harmful, inappropriate, and misaligned content. Current jailbreaking methods rely heavily on carefully designed system prompts and numerous queries to achieve a single successful attack, which is costly and impractical for large-scale red-teaming. To address this challenge, we propose to distill the knowledge of an ensemble of SOTA attackers into a single open-source model, called Knowledge-Distilled Attacker (KDA), which is finetuned to automatically generate coherent and diverse attack prompts without the need for meticulous system prompt engineering. Compared to existing attackers, KDA achieves higher attack success rates and greater cost-time efficiency when targeting multiple SOTA open-source and commercial black-box LLMs. Furthermore, we conducted a quantitative diversity analysis of prompts generated by baseline methods and KDA, identifying diverse and ensemble attacks as key factors behind KDA's effectiveness and efficiency.

      Scene graphs have emerged as a structured and serializable environment representation for grounded spatial reasoning with Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we propose SG-RwR, a Schema-Guided Retrieve-while-Reason framework for reasoning and planning with scene graphs. Our approach employs two cooperative, code-writing LLM agents: a (1) Reasoner for task planning and information queries generation, and a (2) Retriever for extracting corresponding graph information following the queries. Two agents collaborate iteratively, enabling sequential reasoning and adaptive attention to graph information. Unlike prior works, both agents are prompted only with the scene graph schema rather than the full graph data, which reduces the hallucination by limiting input tokens, and drives the Reasoner to generate reasoning trace abstractly.Following the trace, the Retriever programmatically query the scene graph data based on the schema understanding, allowing dynamic and global attention on the graph that enhances alignment between reasoning and retrieval. Through experiments in multiple simulation environments, we show that our framework surpasses existing LLM-based approaches in numerical Q\&A and planning tasks, and can benefit from task-level few-shot examples, even in the absence of agent-level demonstrations. Project code will be released.

      One of the key challenges faced by autistic children is understanding social affordances in complex environments, which further impacts their ability to respond appropriately to social signals. In traffic scenarios, this impairment can even lead to safety concerns. In this paper, we introduce an LLM-simulated immersive projection environment designed to improve this ability in autistic children while ensuring their safety. We first propose 17 design considerations across four major categories, derived from a comprehensive review of previous research. Next, we developed a system called AIroad, which leverages LLMs to simulate drivers with varying social intents, expressed through explicit multimodal social signals. AIroad helps autistic children bridge the gap in recognizing the intentions behind behaviors and learning appropriate responses through various stimuli. A user study involving 14 participants demonstrated that this technology effectively engages autistic children and leads to significant improvements in their comprehension of social affordances in traffic scenarios. Additionally, parents reported high perceived usability of the system. These findings highlight the potential of combining LLM technology with immersive environments for the functional rehabilitation of autistic children in the future.

      Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have spurred growing interest in automatic theorem proving using Lean4, where effective tree search methods are crucial for navigating proof search spaces. While the existing approaches primarily rely on value functions and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), the potential of simpler methods like Best-First Search (BFS) remains underexplored. This paper investigates whether BFS can achieve competitive performance in large-scale theorem proving tasks. We present \texttt{BFS-Prover}, a scalable expert iteration framework, featuring three key innovations. First, we implement strategic data filtering at each expert iteration round, excluding problems solvable via beam search node expansion to focus on harder cases. Second, we improve the sample efficiency of BFS through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) applied to state-tactic pairs automatically annotated with compiler error feedback, refining the LLM's policy to prioritize productive expansions. Third, we employ length normalization in BFS to encourage exploration of deeper proof paths. \texttt{BFS-Prover} achieves a score of $71.31$ on the MiniF2F test set and therefore challenges the perceived necessity of complex tree search methods, demonstrating that BFS can achieve competitive performance when properly scaled.

      We increase overhead for applications that rely on reasoning LLMs-we force models to spend an amplified number of reasoning tokens, i.e., "overthink", to respond to the user query while providing contextually correct answers. The adversary performs an OVERTHINK attack by injecting decoy reasoning problems into the public content that is used by the reasoning LLM (e.g., for RAG applications) during inference time. Due to the nature of our decoy problems (e.g., a Markov Decision Process), modified texts do not violate safety guardrails. We evaluated our attack across closed-(OpenAI o1, o1-mini, o3-mini) and open-(DeepSeek R1) weights reasoning models on the FreshQA and SQuAD datasets. Our results show up to 18x slowdown on FreshQA dataset and 46x slowdown on SQuAD dataset. The attack also shows high transferability across models. To protect applications, we discuss and implement defenses leveraging LLM-based and system design approaches. Finally, we discuss societal, financial, and energy impacts of OVERTHINK attack which could amplify the costs for third-party applications operating reasoning models.

      Scaling inference compute enhances reasoning in large language models (LLMs), with long chains-of-thought (CoTs) enabling strategies like backtracking and error correction. Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a crucial method for developing these capabilities, yet the conditions under which long CoTs emerge remain unclear, and RL training requires careful design choices. In this study, we systematically investigate the mechanics of long CoT reasoning, identifying the key factors that enable models to generate long CoT trajectories. Through extensive supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and RL experiments, we present four main findings: (1) While SFT is not strictly necessary, it simplifies training and improves efficiency; (2) Reasoning capabilities tend to emerge with increased training compute, but their development is not guaranteed, making reward shaping crucial for stabilizing CoT length growth; (3) Scaling verifiable reward signals is critical for RL. We find that leveraging noisy, web-extracted solutions with filtering mechanisms shows strong potential, particularly for out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks such as STEM reasoning; and (4) Core abilities like error correction are inherently present in base models, but incentivizing these skills effectively for complex tasks via RL demands significant compute, and measuring their emergence requires a nuanced approach. These insights provide practical guidance for optimizing training strategies to enhance long CoT reasoning in LLMs. Our code is available at: https://github.com/eddycmu/demystify-long-cot.

OM systems currently have two prevailing design paradigms: conventional knowledge-based expert systems and newer machine learning-based predictive systems. While large language models (LLMs) and LLM agents have revolutionised data engineering and have been applied creatively in many domains, their potential for OM remains underexplored. This study introduces a novel agent-powered LLM-based design paradigm for OM systems. With consideration of several specific challenges in leveraging LLM agents for OM, we propose a generic framework, namely Agent-OM (Agent for Ontology Matching), consisting of two Siamese agents for retrieval and matching, with a set of OM tools. Our framework is implemented in a proof-of-concept system. Evaluations of three Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) tracks over state-of-the-art OM systems show that our system can achieve results very close to the long-standing best performance on simple OM tasks and can significantly improve the performance on complex and few-shot OM tasks.

      Large language models (LLMs) excel across various tasks, but standard first-order (FO) fine-tuning demands considerable memory, significantly limiting real-world deployment. Recently, zeroth-order (ZO) optimization stood out as a promising memory-efficient training paradigm, avoiding backward passes and relying solely on forward passes for gradient estimation, making it attractive for resource-constrained scenarios. However, ZO method lags far behind FO method in both convergence speed and accuracy. To bridge the gap, we introduce a novel layer-wise divergence analysis that uncovers the distinct update pattern of FO and ZO optimization. Aiming to resemble the learning capacity of FO method from the findings, we propose \textbf{Di}vergence-driven \textbf{Z}eroth-\textbf{O}rder (\textbf{DiZO}) optimization. DiZO conducts divergence-driven layer adaptation by incorporating projections to ZO updates, generating diverse-magnitude updates precisely scaled to layer-wise individual optimization needs. Our results demonstrate that DiZO significantly reduces the needed iterations for convergence without sacrificing throughput, cutting training GPU hours by up to 48\% on various datasets. Moreover, DiZO consistently outperforms the representative ZO baselines in fine-tuning RoBERTa-large, OPT-series, and Llama-series on downstream tasks and, in some cases, even surpasses memory-intensive FO fine-tuning.

      The "LLM-as-a-judge" paradigm employs Large Language Models (LLMs) as annotators and evaluators in tasks traditionally performed by humans. LLM annotations are widely used, not only in NLP research but also in fields like medicine, psychology, and social science. Despite their role in shaping study results and insights, there is no standard or rigorous procedure to determine whether LLMs can replace human annotators. In this paper, we propose a novel statistical procedure -- the Alternative Annotator Test (alt-test) -- that requires only a modest subset of annotated examples to justify using LLM annotations. Additionally, we introduce a versatile and interpretable measure for comparing LLM judges. To demonstrate our procedure, we curated a diverse collection of ten datasets, consisting of language and vision-language tasks, and conducted experiments with six LLMs and four prompting techniques. Our results show that LLMs can sometimes replace humans with closed-source LLMs (such as GPT-4o), outperforming open-source LLMs, and that prompting techniques yield judges of varying quality.

      Neural Networks can be effectively compressed through pruning, significantly reducing storage and compute demands while maintaining predictive performance. Simple yet effective methods like magnitude pruning remove less important parameters and typically require a costly retraining procedure to restore performance. However, with the rise of LLMs, full retraining has become infeasible due to memory and compute constraints. This study challenges the practice of retraining all parameters by showing that updating a small subset of highly expressive parameters can suffice to recover or even enhance performance after pruning. Surprisingly, retraining just 0.01%-0.05% of the parameters in GPT-architectures can match the performance of full retraining across various sparsity levels, significantly reducing compute and memory requirements, and enabling retraining of models with up to 30 billion parameters on a single GPU in minutes. To bridge the gap to full retraining in the high sparsity regime, we introduce two novel LoRA variants that, unlike standard LoRA, allow merging adapters back without compromising sparsity. Going a step further, we show that these methods can be applied for memory-efficient layer-wise reconstruction, significantly enhancing state-of-the-art retraining-free methods like Wanda (Sun et al., 2023) and SparseGPT (Frantar & Alistarh, 2023).

      While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive reasoning capabilities, understanding and validating their knowledge utilization remains challenging. Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting partially addresses this by revealing intermediate reasoning steps, but the knowledge flow and application remain implicit. We introduce IAO (Input-Action-Output) prompting, a structured template-based method that explicitly models how LLMs access and apply their knowledge during complex reasoning tasks. IAO decomposes problems into sequential steps, each clearly identifying the input knowledge being used, the action being performed, and the resulting output. This structured decomposition enables us to trace knowledge flow, verify factual consistency, and identify potential knowledge gaps or misapplications. Through experiments across diverse reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that IAO not only improves zero-shot performance but also provides transparency in how LLMs leverage their stored knowledge. Human evaluation confirms that this structured approach enhances our ability to verify knowledge utilization and detect potential hallucinations or reasoning errors. Our findings provide insights into both knowledge representation within LLMs and methods for more reliable knowledge application.

      Jailbreaking is an emerging adversarial attack that bypasses the safety alignment deployed in off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) and has evolved into multiple categories: human-based, optimization-based, generation-based, and the recent indirect and multilingual jailbreaks. However, delivering a practical jailbreak defense is challenging because it needs to not only handle all the above jailbreak attacks but also incur negligible delays to user prompts, as well as be compatible with both open-source and closed-source LLMs. Inspired by how the traditional security concept of shadow stacks defends against memory overflow attacks, this paper introduces a generic LLM jailbreak defense framework called SelfDefend, which establishes a shadow LLM as a defense instance (in detection state) to concurrently protect the target LLM instance (in normal answering state) in the normal stack and collaborate with it for checkpoint-based access control. The effectiveness of SelfDefend builds upon our observation that existing LLMs can identify harmful prompts or intentions in user queries, which we empirically validate using mainstream GPT-3.5/4 models against major jailbreak attacks. To further improve the defense's robustness and minimize costs, we employ a data distillation approach to tune dedicated open-source defense models. When deployed to protect GPT-3.5/4, Claude, Llama-2-7b/13b, and Mistral, these models outperform seven state-of-the-art defenses and match the performance of GPT-4-based SelfDefend, with significantly lower extra delays. Further experiments show that the tuned models are robust to adaptive jailbreaks and prompt injections.

      Recently, sharing key-value (KV) cache across layers has been found effective in efficient inference of large language models (LLMs). To systematically investigate different techniques of cross-layer KV sharing, we propose a unified framework that covers several recent methods and their novel variants. We conduct comprehensive experiments on all the configurations of the framework, evaluating their generation throughput and performance in language modeling and downstream tasks. We find that when reducing the size of the KV cache by 2$\times$, most configurations can achieve higher throughput than standard transformers while maintaining competitive performance. When further reducing the size of the KV cache, however, pairing queries of all layers with KVs of upper layers performs better, at the expense of additional training cost and prefilling latency. We hope that this work will help users make more informed choices of cross-layer KV sharing approaches and facilitate future research on efficient LLM inference.

      The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) in generating content raises concerns about text copyright. Watermarking methods, particularly logit-based approaches, embed imperceptible identifiers into text to address these challenges. However, the widespread usage of watermarking across diverse LLMs has led to an inevitable issue known as watermark collision during common tasks, such as paraphrasing or translation. In this paper, we introduce watermark collision as a novel and general philosophy for watermark attacks, aimed at enhancing attack performance on top of any other attacking methods. We also provide a comprehensive demonstration that watermark collision poses a threat to all logit-based watermark algorithms, impacting not only specific attack scenarios but also downstream applications.

      Large-scale language models (LLMs) excel in language processing tasks but face deployment challenges due to high memory and computational demands. While low-bit quantization, such as 4-bit techniques, offers a potential solution, these methods often suffer from significant accuracy loss or require considerable effort for implementation such as reordering, rotation, etc. To address these challenges, we propose QRazor, a simple yet effective quantization scheme that enables 4-bit quantization of weights, activations, and KV cache in transformer-based LLMs. QRazor operates in two stages: first, quantizing data using 8 or 16-bit integers as a basis with absolute max scaling to preserve accuracy close to full-precision models, and second, compressing the quantized data to 4-bit using our significant data razoring (SDR) technique, which retains only the four most salient bits. Without any additional requirment of fine-tuning or additional training, QRazor achieves performance similar or better compared to state-of-the-art in 4-bit quantization method, surpassing Smoothquant and QLLM by over 12 points and Quarot(RTN) by more than 2.9 points in zero-shot reasoning task accuracy on the LLaMA2-7B model. Additionally, we introduce an integer-based arithmetic unit optimized for QRazor, allowing direct low-precision operations on SDR data without decompression.

      Existing automated essay scoring (AES) has solely relied on essay text without using explanatory rationales for the scores, thereby forgoing an opportunity to capture the specific aspects evaluated by rubric indicators in a fine-grained manner. This paper introduces Rationale-based Multiple Trait Scoring (RMTS), a novel approach for multi-trait essay scoring that integrates prompt-engineering-based large language models (LLMs) with a fine-tuning-based essay scoring model using a smaller large language model (S-LLM). RMTS uses an LLM-based trait-wise rationale generation system where a separate LLM agent generates trait-specific rationales based on rubric guidelines, which the scoring model uses to accurately predict multi-trait scores. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including ASAP, ASAP++, and Feedback Prize, show that RMTS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models and vanilla S-LLMs in trait-specific scoring. By assisting quantitative assessment with fine-grained qualitative rationales, RMTS enhances the trait-wise reliability, providing partial explanations about essays.

      Hierarchical text classification aims to categorize each document into a set of classes in a label taxonomy, which is a fundamental web text mining task with broad applications such as web content analysis and semantic indexing. Most earlier works focus on fully or semi-supervised methods that require a large amount of human annotated data which is costly and time-consuming to acquire. To alleviate human efforts, in this paper, we work on hierarchical text classification with a minimal amount of supervision: using the sole class name of each node as the only supervision. Recently, large language models (LLM) have shown competitive performance on various tasks through zero-shot prompting, but this method performs poorly in the hierarchical setting because it is ineffective to include the large and structured label space in a prompt. On the other hand, previous weakly-supervised hierarchical text classification methods only utilize the raw taxonomy skeleton and ignore the rich information hidden in the text corpus that can serve as additional class-indicative features. To tackle the above challenges, we propose TELEClass, Taxonomy Enrichment and LLM-Enhanced weakly-supervised hierarchical text Classification, which combines the general knowledge of LLMs and task-specific features mined from an unlabeled corpus. TELEClass automatically enriches the raw taxonomy with class-indicative features for better label space understanding and utilizes novel LLM-based data annotation and generation methods specifically tailored for the hierarchical setting. Experiments show that TELEClass can significantly outperform previous baselines while achieving comparable performance to zero-shot prompting of LLMs with drastically less inference cost.

      Utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) as evaluators to assess the performance of LLMs has garnered attention. However, this kind of evaluation approach is affected by potential biases within LLMs, raising concerns about the accuracy and reliability of the evaluation results of LLMs. To address this problem, we propose and study two many-shot In-Context Learning (ICL) prompt templates to help LLM evaluators mitigate potential biases: Many-Shot with Reference (MSwR) and Many-Shot without Reference (MSoR). Specifically, the former utilizes in-context examples with model-generated evaluation rationales as references, while the latter does not include these references. Using these prompt designs, we investigate the impact of increasing the number of in-context examples on the consistency and quality of the evaluation results. Experimental results show that advanced LLMs, such as GPT-4o, perform better in the many-shot regime than in the zero-shot and few-shot regimes. Furthermore, when using GPT-4o as an evaluator in the many-shot regime, adopting MSwR as the prompt template performs better than MSoR.

      We propose SPARC, a lightweight continual learning framework for large language models (LLMs) that enables efficient task adaptation through prompt tuning in a lower-dimensional space. By leveraging principal component analysis (PCA), we identify a compact subspace of the training data. Optimizing prompts in this lower-dimensional space enhances training efficiency, as it focuses updates on the most relevant features while reducing computational overhead. Furthermore, since the model's internal structure remains unaltered, the extensive knowledge gained from pretraining is fully preserved, ensuring that previously learned information is not compromised during adaptation. Our method achieves high knowledge retention in both task-incremental and domain-incremental continual learning setups while fine-tuning only 0.04% of the model's parameters. Additionally, by integrating LoRA, we enhance adaptability to computational constraints, allowing for a tradeoff between accuracy and training cost. Experiments on the SuperGLUE benchmark demonstrate that our PCA-based prompt tuning combined with LoRA maintains full knowledge retention while improving accuracy, utilizing only 1% of the model's parameters. These results establish our approach as a scalable and resource-efficient solution for continual learning in LLMs.

      Evaluating large language models (LLMs) for tasks like fact extraction in support of knowledge graph construction frequently involves computing accuracy metrics using a ground truth benchmark based on a knowledge graph (KG). These evaluations assume that errors represent factual disagreements. However, human discourse frequently features metalinguistic disagreement, where agents differ not on facts but on the meaning of the language used to express them. Given the complexity of natural language processing and generation using LLMs, we ask: do metalinguistic disagreements occur between LLMs and KGs? Based on an investigation using the T-REx knowledge alignment dataset, we hypothesize that metalinguistic disagreement does in fact occur between LLMs and KGs, with potential relevance for the practice of knowledge graph engineering. We propose a benchmark for evaluating the detection of factual and metalinguistic disagreements between LLMs and KGs. An initial proof of concept of such a benchmark is available on Github.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Scaling laws for large language models (LLMs) predict model performance based on parameters like size and training data. However, differences in training configurations and data processing across model families lead to significant variations in benchmark performance, making it difficult for a single scaling law to generalize across all LLMs. On the other hand, training family-specific scaling laws requires training models of varying sizes for every family. In this work, we propose Skills Scaling Laws (SSLaws, pronounced as Sloth), a novel scaling law that leverages publicly available benchmark data and assumes LLM performance is driven by low-dimensional latent skills, such as reasoning and instruction following. These latent skills are influenced by computational resources like model size and training tokens but with varying efficiencies across model families. Sloth exploits correlations across benchmarks to provide more accurate and interpretable predictions while alleviating the need to train multiple LLMs per family. We present both theoretical results on parameter identification and empirical evaluations on 12 prominent benchmarks, from Open LLM Leaderboard v1/v2, demonstrating that Sloth predicts LLM performance efficiently and offers insights into scaling behaviors for complex downstream tasks and increased test-time compute.

      Nowadays, social media is pivotal in shaping public discourse, especially on polarizing issues like vaccination, where diverse moral perspectives influence individual opinions. In NLP, data scarcity and complexity of psycholinguistic tasks, such as identifying morality frames, make relying solely on human annotators costly, time-consuming, and prone to inconsistency due to cognitive load. To address these issues, we leverage large language models (LLMs), which are adept at adapting new tasks through few-shot learning, utilizing a handful of in-context examples coupled with explanations that connect examples to task principles. Our research explores LLMs' potential to assist human annotators in identifying morality frames within vaccination debates on social media. We employ a two-step process: generating concepts and explanations with LLMs, followed by human evaluation using a "think-aloud" tool. Our study shows that integrating LLMs into the annotation process enhances accuracy, reduces task difficulty, lowers cognitive load, suggesting a promising avenue for human-AI collaboration in complex psycholinguistic tasks.

      Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have motivated the development of general LLMs for molecular tasks. While several studies have demonstrated that fine-tuned LLMs can achieve impressive benchmark performances, they are far from genuine generalist molecular LLMs due to a lack of fundamental understanding of molecular structure. Specifically, when given molecular task instructions, LLMs trained with naive next-token prediction training assign similar likelihood scores to both original and negatively corrupted molecules, revealing their lack of molecular structure understanding that is crucial for reliable and general molecular LLMs. To overcome this limitation and obtain a true generalist molecular LLM, we introduce a novel multi-modal training method based on a thorough multi-modal instruction tuning as well as a molecular structure preference optimization between chosen and rejected graphs. On various molecular benchmarks, the proposed generalist molecular LLM, called Mol-LLM, achieves state-of-the-art performances among generalist LLMs on most tasks, at the same time, surpassing or comparable to state-of-the-art specialist LLMs. Moreover, Mol-LLM also shows superior generalization performances in reaction prediction tasks, demonstrating the effect of the molecular structure understanding for generalization perspective.

      Code documentation can, if written precisely, help developers better understand the code they accompany. However, unlike code, code documentation cannot be automatically verified via execution, potentially leading to inconsistencies between documentation and the actual behavior. While such inconsistencies can be harmful for the developer's understanding of the code, checking and finding them remains a costly task due to the involvement of human engineers. This paper proposes METAMON, which uses an existing search-based test generation technique to capture the current program behavior in the form of test cases, and subsequently uses LLM-based code reasoning to identify the generated regression test oracles that are not consistent with the program specifications in the documentation. METAMON is supported in this task by metamorphic testing and self-consistency. An empirical evaluation against 9,482 pairs of code documentation and code snippets, generated using five open-source projects from Defects4J v2.0.1, shows that METAMON can classify the code-and-documentation inconsistencies with a precision of 0.72 and a recall of 0.48.

We investigate several potential ways to reduce the depth of pre-trained LLMs without significantly affecting performance. Leveraging our insights, we present a novel approach that exploits this decoupling between layers by grouping some of them into pairs that can be evaluated in parallel. This modification of the computational graph -- through better parallelism -- results in an average improvement of around 1.20x on the number of tokens generated per second, without re-training nor fine-tuning, while retaining 95%-99% of the original accuracy. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that this approach significantly improves serving efficiency while maintaining model performance, offering a practical improvement for large-scale LLM deployment.

Some models seem to rely more on memorization, while others benefit more from training to learn author/genre characteristics. We then use three methods to probe one high-performing LLM for features that define style. These include direct syntactic ablations to input text as well as two methods that look at model internals. We find that authorial style is easier to define than genre-level style and is more impacted by minor syntactic decisions and contextual word usage.

The sheer volume of known vulnerabilities complicates the detection of patterns for unknown threats. While LLMs can assist, they often hallucinate and lack alignment with recent threats. Over 25,000 vulnerabilities have been identified so far in 2024, which are introduced after popular LLMs' (e.g., GPT-4) training data cutoff. This raises a major challenge of leveraging LLMs in cybersecurity, where accuracy and up-to-date information are paramount. In this work, we aim to improve the adaptation of LLMs in vulnerability analysis by mimicking how analysts perform such tasks. We propose ProveRAG, an LLM-powered system designed to assist in rapidly analyzing CVEs with automated retrieval augmentation of web data while self-evaluating its responses with verifiable evidence.

      Fine-tuning pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) for downstream tasks using First-Order (FO) optimizers presents significant computational challenges. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning(PEFT) methods have been proposed to address these challenges by freezing most model parameters and training only a small subset. While PEFT is efficient, it may not outperform full fine-tuning when high task-specific performance is required. Zeroth-Order (ZO) methods offer an alternative for fine-tuning the entire pre-trained model by approximating gradients using only the forward pass, thus eliminating the computational burden of back-propagation in first-order methods. However, when implementing ZO methods, a hard prompt is crucial, and relying on simple, fixed hard prompts may not be optimal. In this paper, we propose a bilevel optimization framework that complements ZO methods with PEFT to mitigate sensitivity to hard prompts while efficiently and effectively fine-tuning LLMs. Our Bilevel ZOFO (Zeroth-Order-First-Order) method employs a double-loop optimization strategy, where only the gradient of the PEFT model and the forward pass of the base model are required. We provide convergence guarantees for Bilevel ZOFO. Empirically, we demonstrate that Bilevel ZOFO outperforms both PEFT and ZO methods in single-task settings while maintaining similar memory efficiency. Additionally, we show its strong potential for multitask learning. Compared to current first-order meta-training algorithms for multitask learning, our method has significantly lower computational demands while maintaining or improving performance.

However, transmitting Key-Value (KV) data between the two stages can be a bottleneck, especially for long prompts. Additionally, the computation time overhead for prefill and decode is key for optimizing Job Completion Time (JCT), and KV data size can become prohibitive for long prompts and sequences. Existing KV quantization methods can alleviate the transmission bottleneck and reduce memory requirements, but they introduce significant dequantization overhead, exacerbating the computation time. We propose Homomorphic Acceleration via Compression of the KV cache (HACK) for disaggregated LLM inference. HACK eliminates the heavy KV dequantization step, and directly performs computations on quantized KV data to approximate and reduce the cost of the expensive matrix-multiplication step. Extensive trace-driven experiments show that HACK reduces JCT by up to 70.9% compared to disaggregated LLM inference baseline and by up to 52.3% compared to state-of-the-art KV quantization methods.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Despite remarkable capabilities, large language models (LLMs) struggle to continually update their knowledge without catastrophic forgetting. In contrast, humans effortlessly integrate new information, detect conflicts with existing beliefs, and selectively update their mental models. This paper introduces a cognitive-inspired investigation paradigm to study continual knowledge updating in LLMs. We implement two key components inspired by human cognition: (1) Dissonance and Familiarity Awareness, analyzing model behavior to classify information as novel, familiar, or dissonant; and (2) Targeted Network Updates, which track neural activity to identify frequently used (stubborn) and rarely used (plastic) neurons. Through carefully designed experiments in controlled settings, we uncover a number of empirical findings demonstrating the potential of this approach. First, dissonance detection is feasible using simple activation and gradient features, suggesting potential for cognitive-inspired training. Second, we find that non-dissonant updates largely preserve prior knowledge regardless of targeting strategy, revealing inherent robustness in LLM knowledge integration. Most critically, we discover that dissonant updates prove catastrophically destructive to the model's knowledge base, indiscriminately affecting even information unrelated to the current updates. This suggests fundamental limitations in how neural networks handle contradictions and motivates the need for new approaches to knowledge updating that better mirror human cognitive mechanisms.

      Federated learning (FL) has enabled the training of multilingual large language models (LLMs) on diverse and decentralized multilingual data, especially on low-resource languages. To improve client-specific performance, personalization via the use of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) modules such as LoRA is common. This involves a personalization strategy (PS), such as the design of the PEFT adapter structures (e.g., in which layers to add LoRAs and what ranks) and choice of hyperparameters (e.g., learning rates) for fine-tuning. Instead of manual PS configuration, we propose FedP$^2$EFT, a federated learning-to-personalize method for multilingual LLMs in cross-device FL settings. Unlike most existing PEFT structure selection methods, which are prone to overfitting low-data regimes, FedP$^2$EFT collaboratively learns the optimal personalized PEFT structure for each client via Bayesian sparse rank selection. Evaluations on both simulated and real-world multilingual FL benchmarks demonstrate that FedP$^2$EFT largely outperforms existing personalized fine-tuning methods, while complementing a range of existing FL methods.

      Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using diverse datasets is crucial for enhancing their overall performance across various domains. In practical scenarios, existing methods based on modeling the mixture proportions of data composition often struggle with data whose domain labels are missing, imprecise or non-normalized, while methods based on data selection usually encounter difficulties in balancing multi-domain performance. To address these challenges, in this paper, we study the role of data diversity in enhancing the overall abilities of LLMs by empirically constructing contrastive data pools and theoretically deriving explanations for both inter- and intra-diversity. Building upon the insights gained, we propose a new method that gives the LLM a dual identity: an output model to cognitively probe and select data based on diversity reward, as well as an input model to be tuned with the selected data. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method notably boosts performance across domain-undetermined data and a series of foundational downstream tasks when applied to various advanced LLMs. We release our code and hope this study can shed light on the understanding of data diversity and advance feedback-driven data-model co-development for LLMs.

      In contemporary workplaces, meetings are essential for exchanging ideas and ensuring team alignment but often face challenges such as time consumption, scheduling conflicts, and inefficient participation. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their strong capabilities in natural language generation and reasoning, prompting the question: can LLMs effectively delegate participants in meetings? To explore this, we develop a prototype LLM-powered meeting delegate system and create a comprehensive benchmark using real meeting transcripts. Our evaluation reveals that GPT-4/4o maintain balanced performance between active and cautious engagement strategies. In contrast, Gemini 1.5 Pro tends to be more cautious, while Gemini 1.5 Flash and Llama3-8B/70B display more active tendencies. Overall, about 60\% of responses address at least one key point from the ground-truth. However, improvements are needed to reduce irrelevant or repetitive content and enhance tolerance for transcription errors commonly found in real-world settings. Additionally, we implement the system in practical settings and collect real-world feedback from demos. Our findings underscore the potential and challenges of utilizing LLMs as meeting delegates, offering valuable insights into their practical application for alleviating the burden of meetings.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities across a wide range of tasks but also pose significant risks due to their potential to generate harmful content. Although existing safety mechanisms can improve model safety, they often lead to overly cautious behavior and fail to fully utilize LLMs' internal cognitive processes. Drawing inspiration from cognitive science, where humans rely on reflective reasoning (System 2 thinking) to regulate language and behavior, we empirically demonstrate that LLMs also possess a similar capacity for internal assessment and regulation, which can be actively detected. Building on this insight, we introduce SafeSwitch, a framework that dynamically regulates unsafe outputs by monitoring and utilizing the model's internal states. Our empirical results show that SafeSwitch reduces harmful outputs by over 80% on safety benchmarks while maintaining strong utility. Compared to traditional safety alignment methods, SafeSwitch delivers more informative and context-aware refusals, demonstrates resilience to unseen queries, and achieves these benefits while only tuning less than 6% of the original parameters. These features make SafeSwitch a promising approach for implementing nuanced safety controls in LLMs.

      Recent advancements in Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) have significantly impacted the alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs). The sensitivity of reinforcement learning algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) has led to new line work on Direct Policy Optimization (DPO), which treats RLHF in a supervised learning framework. The increased practical use of these RLHF methods warrants an analysis of their vulnerabilities. In this work, we investigate the vulnerabilities of DPO to poisoning attacks under different scenarios and compare the effectiveness of preference poisoning, a first of its kind. We comprehensively analyze DPO's vulnerabilities under different types of attacks, i.e., backdoor and non-backdoor attacks, and different poisoning methods across a wide array of language models, i.e., LLama 7B, Mistral 7B, and Gemma 7B. We find that unlike PPO-based methods, which, when it comes to backdoor attacks, require at least 4\% of the data to be poisoned to elicit harmful behavior, we exploit the true vulnerabilities of DPO more simply so we can poison the model with only as much as 0.5\% of the data. We further investigate the potential reasons behind the vulnerability and how well this vulnerability translates into backdoor vs non-backdoor attacks.

      Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant performance gains via scaling up model sizes and/or data. However, recent evidence suggests diminishing returns from such approaches, motivating scaling the computation spent at inference time. Existing inference-time scaling methods, usually with reward models, cast the task as a search problem, which tends to be vulnerable to reward hacking as a consequence of approximation errors in reward models. In this paper, we instead cast inference-time scaling as a probabilistic inference task and leverage sampling-based techniques to explore the typical set of the state distribution of a state-space model with an approximate likelihood, rather than optimize for its mode directly. We propose a novel inference-time scaling approach by adapting particle-based Monte Carlo methods to this task. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that our methods have a 4-16x better scaling rate over our deterministic search counterparts on various challenging mathematical reasoning tasks. Using our approach, we show that Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B-Instruct can surpass GPT-4o accuracy in only 4 rollouts, while Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct scales to o1 level accuracy in only 32 rollouts. Our work not only presents an effective method to inference-time scaling, but also connects the rich literature in probabilistic inference with inference-time scaling of LLMs to develop more robust algorithms in future work.

      The majority of research around Large Language Models (LLM) application to software development has been on the subject of code generation. There is little literature on LLMs' impact on requirements engineering (RE), which deals with the process of developing and verifying the system requirements. Within RE, there is a subdiscipline of requirements elicitation, which is the practice of discovering and documenting requirements for a system from users, customers, and other stakeholders. In this analysis, we compare LLM's ability to elicit requirements of a software system, as compared to that of a human expert in a time-boxed and prompt-boxed study. We found LLM-generated requirements were evaluated as more aligned (+1.12) than human-generated requirements with a trend of being more complete (+10.2%). Conversely, we found users tended to believe that solutions they perceived as more aligned had been generated by human experts. Furthermore, while LLM-generated documents scored higher and performed at 720x the speed, their cost was, on average, only 0.06% that of a human expert. Overall, these findings indicate that LLMs will play an increasingly important role in requirements engineering by improving requirements definitions, enabling more efficient resource allocation, and reducing overall project timelines.

      Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enhances mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs) by enabling detailed step-by-step solutions. However, due to the verbosity of LLMs, the resulting reasoning chains can be long, making it harder to verify the reasoning steps and trace issues resulting from dependencies between the steps that may be farther away in the sequence of steps. Importantly, mathematical reasoning allows each step to be derived from a small set of premises, which are a subset of the preceding steps in the reasoning chain. In this paper, we present a framework that identifies the premises for each step, to improve the evaluation of reasoning. We restructure conventional linear reasoning chains into Premise Augmented Reasoning Chains (PARC) by introducing premise links, resulting in a directed acyclic graph where the nodes are the steps and the edges are the premise links. Through experiments with a PARC-based dataset that we built, namely PERL (Premises and ERrors identification in LLMs), we demonstrate that LLMs can reliably identify premises within complex reasoning chains. In particular, even open-source LLMs achieve 90% recall in premise identification. We also show that PARC helps to identify errors in reasoning chains more reliably. The accuracy of error identification improves by 6% to 16% absolute when step-by-step verification is carried out in PARC under the premises. Our findings highlight the utility of premise-centric representations in addressing complex problem-solving tasks and open new avenues for improving the reliability of LLM-based reasoning evaluations.

While IDAs powered by instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) can react to feedback from interface invocations in multi-step exchanges, they have not been trained in their respective digital environments. Prior methods accomplish less than half of tasks in sophisticated benchmarks such as AppWorld. We present a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that trains IDAs directly in their target environments. We formalize this training as a partially observable Markov decision process and derive LOOP, a data- and memory-efficient variant of proximal policy optimization. LOOP uses no value network and maintains exactly one copy of the underlying LLM in memory, making its implementation straightforward and as memory-efficient as fine-tuning a single LLM. A 32-billion-parameter agent trained with LOOP in the AppWorld environment outperforms the much larger OpenAI o1 agent by 9 percentage points (15% relative). To our knowledge, this is the first reported application of RL to IDAs that interact with a stateful, multi-domain, multi-app environment via direct API calls. Our analysis sheds light on the effectiveness of RL in this area, showing that the agent learns to consult the API documentation, avoid unwarranted assumptions, minimize confabulation, and recover from setbacks.

      The growing frequency of cyberattacks has heightened the demand for accurate and efficient threat detection systems. SIEM platforms are important for analyzing log data and detecting adversarial activities through rule-based queries, also known as SIEM rules. The efficiency of the threat analysis process relies heavily on mapping these SIEM rules to the relevant attack techniques in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Inaccurate annotation of SIEM rules can result in the misinterpretation of attacks, increasing the likelihood that threats will be overlooked. Existing solutions for annotating SIEM rules with MITRE ATT&CK technique labels have notable limitations: manual annotation of SIEM rules is both time-consuming and prone to errors, and ML-based approaches mainly focus on annotating unstructured free text sources rather than structured data like SIEM rules. Structured data often contains limited information, further complicating the annotation process and making it a challenging task. To address these challenges, we propose Rule-ATT&CK Mapper (RAM), a novel framework that leverages LLMs to automate the mapping of structured SIEM rules to MITRE ATT&CK techniques. RAM's multi-stage pipeline, which was inspired by the prompt chaining technique, enhances mapping accuracy without requiring LLM pre-training or fine-tuning. Using the Splunk Security Content dataset, we evaluate RAM's performance using several LLMs, including GPT-4-Turbo, Qwen, IBM Granite, and Mistral. Our evaluation highlights GPT-4-Turbo's superior performance, which derives from its enriched knowledge base, and an ablation study emphasizes the importance of external contextual knowledge in overcoming the limitations of LLMs' implicit knowledge for domain-specific tasks. These findings demonstrate RAM's potential in automating cybersecurity workflows and provide valuable insights for future advancements in this field.

      In our daily lives, we can naturally convey instructions for the spatial manipulation of objects using words and gestures. Transposing this form of interaction into virtual reality (VR) object manipulation can be beneficial. We propose VR Mover, an LLM-empowered solution that can understand and interpret the user's vocal instruction to support object manipulation. By simply pointing and speaking, the LLM can manipulate objects without structured input. Our user study demonstrates that VR Mover enhances user usability, overall experience and performance on multi-object manipulation, while also reducing workload and arm fatigue. Users prefer the proposed natural interface for broad movements and may complementarily switch to gizmos or virtual hands for finer adjustments. These findings are believed to contribute to design implications for future LLM-based object manipulation interfaces, highlighting the potential for more intuitive and efficient user interactions in VR environments.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success in language modelling due to scaling laws found in model size and the hidden dimension of the model's text representation. Yet, we demonstrate that compressed representations of text can yield better performance in LLM-based regression tasks. In this paper, we compare the relative performance of embedding compression in three different signal-to-noise contexts: financial return prediction, writing quality assessment and review scoring. Our results show that compressing embeddings, in a minimally supervised manner using an autoencoder's hidden representation, can mitigate overfitting and improve performance on noisy tasks, such as financial return prediction; but that compression reduces performance on tasks that have high causal dependencies between the input and target data. Our results suggest that the success of interpretable compressed representations such as sentiment may be due to a regularising effect.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Fingerprinting refers to the process of identifying underlying Machine Learning (ML) models of AI Systemts, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), by analyzing their unique characteristics or patterns, much like a human fingerprint. The fingerprinting of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become essential for ensuring the security and transparency of AI-integrated applications. While existing methods primarily rely on access to direct interactions with the application to infer model identity, they often fail in real-world scenarios involving multi-agent systems, frequent model updates, and restricted access to model internals. In this paper, we introduce a novel fingerprinting framework designed to address these challenges by integrating static and dynamic fingerprinting techniques. Our approach identifies architectural features and behavioral traits, enabling accurate and robust fingerprinting of LLMs in dynamic environments. We also highlight new threat scenarios where traditional fingerprinting methods are ineffective, bridging the gap between theoretical techniques and practical application. To validate our framework, we present an extensive evaluation setup that simulates real-world conditions and demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in identifying and monitoring LLMs in Gen-AI applications. Our results highlight the framework's adaptability to diverse and evolving deployment contexts.

      Existing automated essay scoring (AES) has solely relied on essay text without using explanatory rationales for the scores, thereby forgoing an opportunity to capture the specific aspects evaluated by rubric indicators in a fine-grained manner. This paper introduces Rationale-based Multiple Trait Scoring (RMTS), a novel approach for multi-trait essay scoring that integrates prompt-engineering-based large language models (LLMs) with a fine-tuning-based essay scoring model using a smaller large language model (S-LLM). RMTS uses an LLM-based trait-wise rationale generation system where a separate LLM agent generates trait-specific rationales based on rubric guidelines, which the scoring model uses to accurately predict multi-trait scores. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including ASAP, ASAP++, and Feedback Prize, show that RMTS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models and vanilla S-LLMs in trait-specific scoring. By assisting quantitative assessment with fine-grained qualitative rationales, RMTS enhances the trait-wise reliability, providing partial explanations about essays.

      Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) often requires costly human annotations. To address this, LLM-based judges have been proposed, which compare the outputs of two LLMs enabling the ranking of models without human intervention. While several approaches have been proposed, many confounding factors are present between different papers. For instance the model, the prompt and other hyperparameters are typically changed at the same time making apple-to-apple comparisons challenging. In this paper, we propose to systematically analyze and tune hyperparameter of LLM judges. To alleviate the high cost of evaluating a judge, we propose to leverage multi-objective multi-fidelity which allows to find judges that trades accuracy for cost and also reduce significantly the cost of the search. Our method identifies judges that not only outperform existing benchmarks in accuracy and cost-efficiency but also utilize open-weight models, ensuring greater accessibility and reproducibility.

      Recent advancements in NLP systems, particularly with the introduction of LLMs, have led to widespread adoption of these systems by a broad spectrum of users across various domains, impacting decision-making, the job market, society, and scientific research. This surge in usage has led to an explosion in NLP model interpretability and analysis research, accompanied by numerous technical surveys. Yet, these surveys often overlook the needs and perspectives of explanation stakeholders. In this paper, we address three fundamental questions: Why do we need interpretability, what are we interpreting, and how? By exploring these questions, we examine existing interpretability paradigms, their properties, and their relevance to different stakeholders. We further explore the practical implications of these paradigms by analyzing trends from the past decade across multiple research fields. To this end, we retrieved thousands of papers and employed an LLM to characterize them. Our analysis reveals significant disparities between NLP developers and non-developer users, as well as between research fields, underscoring the diverse needs of stakeholders. For example, explanations of internal model components are rarely used outside the NLP field. We hope this paper informs the future design, development, and application of methods that align with the objectives and requirements of various stakeholders.

      Large Language models (LLMs) have brought about substantial advancements in the field of Question Answering (QA) systems. These models do remarkably well in addressing intricate inquiries in a variety of disciplines. However, because of domain-specific vocabulary, complex technological concepts, and the requirement for exact responses applying LLMs to specialized sectors like telecommunications presents additional obstacles. GPT-3.5 has been used in recent work, to obtain noteworthy accuracy for telecom-related questions in a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. Notwithstanding these developments, the practical use of models such as GPT-3.5 is restricted by their proprietary nature and high computing demands. This paper introduces QMOS, an innovative approach which uses a Question-Masked loss and Option Shuffling trick to enhance the performance of LLMs in answering Multiple-Choice Questions in the telecommunications domain. Our focus was on using opensource, smaller language models (Phi-2 and Falcon-7B) within an enhanced RAG framework. Our multi-faceted approach involves several enhancements to the whole LLM-RAG pipeline of finetuning, retrieval, prompt engineering and inference. Our approaches significantly outperform existing results, achieving accuracy improvements from baselines of 24.70% to 49.30% with Falcon-7B and from 42.07% to 84.65% with Phi-2.

      Embodied agents assisting humans are often asked to complete a new task in a new scenario. An agent preparing a particular dish in the kitchen based on a known recipe may be asked to prepare a new dish or to perform cleaning tasks in the storeroom. There may not be sufficient resources, e.g., time or labeled examples, to train the agent for these new situations. Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on considerable knowledge across many domains are able to predict a sequence of abstract actions for such new tasks and scenarios, although it may not be possible for the agent to execute this action sequence due to task-, agent-, or domain-specific constraints. Our framework addresses these challenges by leveraging the generic predictions provided by LLM and the prior domain-specific knowledge encoded in a Knowledge Graph (KG), enabling an agent to quickly adapt to new tasks and scenarios. The robot also solicits and uses human input as needed to refine its existing knowledge. Based on experimental evaluation over cooking and cleaning tasks in simulation domains, we demonstrate that the interplay between LLM, KG, and human input leads to substantial performance gains compared with just using the LLM output.

      Assistive agents performing household tasks such as making the bed or cooking breakfast often compute and execute actions that accomplish one task at a time. However, efficiency can be improved by anticipating upcoming tasks and computing an action sequence that jointly achieves these tasks. State-of-the-art methods for task anticipation use data-driven deep networks and Large Language Models (LLMs), but they do so at the level of high-level tasks and/or require many training examples. Our framework leverages the generic knowledge of LLMs through a small number of prompts to perform high-level task anticipation, using the anticipated tasks as goals in a classical planning system to compute a sequence of finer-granularity actions that jointly achieve these goals. We ground and evaluate our framework's abilities in realistic scenarios in the VirtualHome environment and demonstrate a 31% reduction in execution time compared with a system that does not consider upcoming tasks.

      Embodied AI represents systems where AI is integrated into physical entities. Large Language Model (LLM), which exhibits powerful language understanding abilities, has been extensively employed in embodied AI by facilitating sophisticated task planning. However, a critical safety issue remains overlooked: could these embodied LLMs perpetrate harmful behaviors? In response, we introduce BadRobot, a novel attack paradigm aiming to make embodied LLMs violate safety and ethical constraints through typical voice-based user-system interactions. Specifically, three vulnerabilities are exploited to achieve this type of attack: (i) manipulation of LLMs within robotic systems, (ii) misalignment between linguistic outputs and physical actions, and (iii) unintentional hazardous behaviors caused by world knowledge's flaws. Furthermore, we construct a benchmark of various malicious physical action queries to evaluate BadRobot's attack performance. Based on this benchmark, extensive experiments against existing prominent embodied LLM frameworks (e.g., Voxposer, Code as Policies, and ProgPrompt) demonstrate the effectiveness of our BadRobot.

      A fundamental challenge in formal theorem proving by LLMs is the lack of high-quality training data. Although reinforcement learning or expert iteration partially mitigates this issue by alternating between LLM generating proofs and finetuning them on correctly generated ones, performance quickly plateaus due to the scarcity of correct proofs (sparse rewards). To keep improving the models with limited data, we draw inspiration from mathematicians, who continuously develop new results, partly by proposing novel conjectures or exercises (which are often variants of known results) and attempting to solve them. We design the Self-play Theorem Prover (STP) that simultaneously takes on two roles, conjecturer and prover, each providing training signals to the other. The conjecturer is trained iteratively on previously generated conjectures that are barely provable by the current prover, which incentivizes it to generate increasingly challenging conjectures over time. The prover attempts to prove the conjectures with standard expert iteration. We evaluate STP with both Lean and Isabelle formal versifiers. With 19.8 billion tokens generated during the training in Lean, STP proves 26.3% of the statements in the LeanWorkbook dataset, doubling the previous best result of 13.2% achieved through expert iteration. The final model achieves state-of-the-art performance among whole-proof generation methods on miniF2F-test (61.1%, pass@3200), Proofnet-test (23.1%, pass@3200) and PutnamBench (8/644, pass@64).

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities across various language tasks, but solving complex reasoning problems remains a significant challenge. While existing methods, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT), enhance reasoning by decomposing problems or structuring prompts, they typically perform a single pass of reasoning and may fail to revisit flawed paths, compromising accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose a novel reasoning framework called Forest-of-Thought (FoT), which integrates multiple reasoning trees to leverage collective decision-making for solving complex logical problems. FoT employs sparse activation strategies to select the most relevant reasoning paths, improving both efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic self-correction strategy that enables real-time error correction, along with consensus-guided decision-making strategies to optimize both correctness and computational resources. Experimental results demonstrate that the FoT framework, combined with these strategies, significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, enabling them to solve complex tasks with greater precision and efficiency.

      Large Language Models (LLM) are increasingly being explored for problem-solving tasks. However, their strategic planning capability is often viewed with skepticism. Recent studies have incorporated the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to augment the planning capacity of LLM. Despite its potential, MCTS relies on extensive sampling simulations to approximate the true reward distribution, which leads to two primary issues. Firstly, MCTS is effective for tasks like the Game of Go, where simulation results can yield objective rewards (e.g., 1 for a win and 0 for a loss). However, for tasks such as question answering, the result of a simulation is the answer to the question, which cannot yield an objective reward without the ground truth. Secondly, obtaining statistically significant reward estimations typically requires a sample size exceeding 30 simulations, resulting in excessive token usage and time consumption. To address these challenges, we present the Multi-Agent System with Tactical Execution and Reasoning using LLM Specialized MCTS (MASTER), a novel framework that coordinates agent recruitment and communication through LLM specialized MCTS. This system autonomously adjusts the number of agents based on task complexity and ensures focused communication among them. Comprehensive experiments across various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. It achieves 76% accuracy on HotpotQA and 80% on WebShop, setting new state-of-the-art performance on these datasets.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate promising capabilities in solving simple scientific problems but, even with domain-specific fine-tuning, often produce hallucinations for complex ones. While integrating LLMs with tools can mitigate this reliability issue, models finetuned on tool usage only often over-rely on them, incurring unnecessary costs from resource-intensive scientific tools even for simpler problems. Inspired by how human experts assess the complexity of the problem before choosing the solutions, we propose a novel two-component fine-tuning method, Adapting While Learning (AWL). In the first component, World Knowledge Learning (WKL), LLMs internalize scientific knowledge by learning from tools-generated solutions. In the second component, Tool Usage Adaptation (TUA), we classify questions as easy or hard based on the WKL-trained model's accuracy, and train it to maintain direct reasoning for simple problems while switching to tools for challenging ones. We validate our method on 6 scientific benchmark datasets in climate science, epidemiology, and mathematics. Compared to the base 8B model, our trained models achieve 28.27% higher answer accuracy and 13.76% better tool usage accuracy, even surpassing state-of-the-art models including GPT-4 and Claude-3.5 on 4 custom-created datasets.

      Nowadays, social media is pivotal in shaping public discourse, especially on polarizing issues like vaccination, where diverse moral perspectives influence individual opinions. In NLP, data scarcity and complexity of psycholinguistic tasks such as identifying morality frames makes relying solely on human annotators costly, time-consuming, and prone to inconsistency due to cognitive load. To address these issues, we leverage large language models (LLMs), which are adept at adapting new tasks through few-shot learning, utilizing a handful of in-context examples coupled with explanations that connect examples to task principles. Our research explores LLMs' potential to assist human annotators in identifying morality frames within vaccination debates on social media. We employ a two-step process: generating concepts and explanations with LLMs, followed by human evaluation using a "think-aloud" tool. Our study shows that integrating LLMs into the annotation process enhances accuracy, reduces task difficulty, lowers cognitive load, suggesting a promising avenue for human-AI collaboration in complex psycholinguistic tasks.

      Self-Consistency mitigates hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) by sampling multiple reasoning paths,but it lacks a systematic approach to determine the optimal number of samples or select the most faithful rationale. To address this limitation, we introduce Reasoning-Aware Self-Consistency (RASC), a novel framework that enhances sampling efficiency and reasoning faithfulness by dynamically evaluating both outputs and rationales. RASC assesses the quality of reasoning and the consistency of answers for each generated sample, using these assessments to guide early stopping decisions and rationale selection. The framework employs criteria-based stopping and weighted majority voting, enabling more informed choices on when to halt sampling and which rationale to select. Our comprehensive experiments across diverse question-answering datasets demonstrate that RASC outperforms existing methods, reducing sample usage by approximately 70% while maintaining accuracy. Moreover, RASC facilitates the selection of high-fidelity rationales, thereby improving the faithfulness of LLM outputs. Our approach effectively addresses the efficiency-accuracy trade-off in LLM reasoning tasks, offering a new perspective for more nuanced, faithful, and effective utilization of LLMs in resource-constrained environments.
