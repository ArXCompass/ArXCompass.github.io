      Despite growing interest in using large language models (LLMs) to automate annotation, their effectiveness in complex, nuanced, and multi-dimensional labelling tasks remains relatively underexplored. This study focuses on annotation for the search clarification task, leveraging a high-quality, multi-dimensional dataset that includes five distinct fine-grained annotation subtasks. Although LLMs have shown impressive capabilities in general settings, our study reveals that even state-of-the-art models struggle to replicate human-level performance in subjective or fine-grained evaluation tasks. Through a systematic assessment, we demonstrate that LLM predictions are often inconsistent, poorly calibrated, and highly sensitive to prompt variations. To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective human-in-the-loop (HITL) workflow that uses confidence thresholds and inter-model disagreement to selectively involve human review. Our findings show that this lightweight intervention significantly improves annotation reliability while reducing human effort by up to 45%, offering a relatively scalable and cost-effective yet accurate path forward for deploying LLMs in real-world evaluation settings.

      The rise of LLMs has driven demand for private serverless deployments, characterized by moderate-scale models and infrequent requests. While existing solutions follow exclusive GPU deployment, we take a step back to explore modern platforms and find that: Emerging CPU architectures with built-in accelerators are capable of serving LLMs but remain underutilized, and both CPUs and GPUs can accommodate multiple LLMs simultaneously. We propose LLM-Mesh, a serverless inference scheme for small-to-mid-sized LLMs that enables elastic sharing across heterogeneous hardware. LLM-Mesh tackles three fundamental challenges: (1) precise, fine-grained compute resource allocation at token-level to handle fluctuating computational demands; (2) a coordinated and forward-looking memory scaling mechanism to detect out-of-memory hazards and reduce operational overhead; and (3) a dual approach that reduces resource fragmentation through proactive preemption and reactive bin-packing. Experimental results on 4 32-core CPUs and 4 A100 GPUs show that LLM-Meshimproves service capacity by 44% - 63% through sharing, while further leveraging CPUs boosts this to 91% - 159%.

      The ability to accurately predict how different population groups would answer subjective questions would have great value. In this work, we show that use of relatively simple supervision can greatly improve language model alignment with diverse population groups, as measured over three datasets spanning various topics. Beyond evaluating average performance, we also report how alignment varies across specific groups. The simplicity and generality of our approach promotes easy adoption, while our broad findings provide useful guidance for when to use or not use our approach in practice. By conducting evaluation over many LLMs and prompting strategies, along with open-sourcing our work, we provide a useful benchmark to stimulate future research.

      Math reasoning has become the poster child of progress in large language models (LLMs), with new models rapidly surpassing human-level performance on benchmarks like MATH and AIME. But as math leaderboards improve week by week, it is worth asking: do these gains reflect broader problem-solving ability or just narrow overfitting? To answer this question, we evaluate over 20 open-weight reasoning-tuned models across a broad suite of tasks, including math, scientific QA, agent planning, coding, and standard instruction-following. We surprisingly find that most models that succeed in math fail to transfer their gains to other domains. To rigorously study this phenomenon, we conduct controlled experiments on Qwen3-14B models using math-only data but different tuning methods. We find that reinforcement learning (RL)-tuned models generalize well across domains, while supervised fine-tuning (SFT)-tuned models often forget general capabilities. Latent-space representation and token-space distribution shift analyses reveal that SFT induces substantial representation and output drift, while RL preserves general-domain structure. Our results suggest a need to rethink standard post-training recipes, particularly the reliance on SFT-distilled data for advancing reasoning models.

      Feedback is one of the most crucial components to facilitate effective learning. With the rise of large language models (LLMs) in recent years, research in programming education has increasingly focused on automated feedback generation to help teachers provide timely support to every student. However, prior studies often overlook key pedagogical principles, such as mastery and progress adaptation, that shape effective feedback strategies. This paper introduces a novel pedagogical framework for LLM-driven feedback generation derived from established feedback models and local insights from secondary school teachers. To evaluate this framework, we implemented a web-based application for Python programming with LLM-based feedback that follows the framework and conducted a mixed-method evaluation with eight secondary-school computer science teachers. Our findings suggest that teachers consider that, when aligned with the framework, LLMs can effectively support students and even outperform human teachers in certain scenarios through instant and precise feedback. However, we also found several limitations, such as its inability to adapt feedback to dynamic classroom contexts. Such a limitation highlights the need to complement LLM-generated feedback with human expertise to ensure effective student learning. This work demonstrates an effective way to use LLMs for feedback while adhering to pedagogical standards and highlights important considerations for future systems.

      Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as personal agents, accessing sensitive user data such as calendars, emails, and medical records. Users currently face a trade-off: They can send private records, many of which are stored in remote databases, to powerful but untrusted LLM providers, increasing their exposure risk. Alternatively, they can run less powerful models locally on trusted devices. We bridge this gap. Our Socratic Chain-of-Thought Reasoning first sends a generic, non-private user query to a powerful, untrusted LLM, which generates a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt and detailed sub-queries without accessing user data. Next, we embed these sub-queries and perform encrypted sub-second semantic search using our Homomorphically Encrypted Vector Database across one million entries of a single user's private data. This represents a realistic scale of personal documents, emails, and records accumulated over years of digital activity. Finally, we feed the CoT prompt and the decrypted records to a local language model and generate the final response. On the LoCoMo long-context QA benchmark, our hybrid framework, combining GPT-4o with a local Llama-3.2-1B model, outperforms using GPT-4o alone by up to 7.1 percentage points. This demonstrates a first step toward systems where tasks are decomposed and split between untrusted strong LLMs and weak local ones, preserving user privacy.

      In this work, we explore uncertainty estimation as a proxy for correctness in LLM-generated code. To this end, we adapt two state-of-the-art techniques from natural language generation -- one based on entropy and another on mutual information -- to the domain of code generation. Given the distinct semantic properties of code, we introduce modifications, including a semantic equivalence check based on symbolic execution. Our findings indicate a strong correlation between the uncertainty computed through these techniques and correctness, highlighting the potential of uncertainty estimation for quality assessment. Additionally, we propose a simplified version of the entropy-based method that assumes a uniform distribution over the LLM's responses, demonstrating comparable effectiveness. Using these techniques, we develop an abstention policy that prevents the model from making predictions when uncertainty is high, reducing incorrect outputs to near zero. Our evaluation on the LiveCodeBench shows that our approach significantly outperforms a baseline relying solely on LLM-reported log-probabilities.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      This paper challenges the prevailing tendency to frame Large Language Models (LLMs) as cognitive systems, arguing instead for a semiotic perspective that situates these models within the broader dynamics of sign manipulation and meaning-making. Rather than assuming that LLMs understand language or simulate human thought, we propose that their primary function is to recombine, recontextualize, and circulate linguistic forms based on probabilistic associations. By shifting from a cognitivist to a semiotic framework, we avoid anthropomorphism and gain a more precise understanding of how LLMs participate in cultural processes, not by thinking, but by generating texts that invite interpretation. Through theoretical analysis and practical examples, the paper demonstrates how LLMs function as semiotic agents whose outputs can be treated as interpretive acts, open to contextual negotiation and critical reflection. We explore applications in literature, philosophy, education, and cultural production, emphasizing how LLMs can serve as tools for creativity, dialogue, and critical inquiry. The semiotic paradigm foregrounds the situated, contingent, and socially embedded nature of meaning, offering a more rigorous and ethically aware framework for studying and using LLMs. Ultimately, this approach reframes LLMs as technological participants in an ongoing ecology of signs. They do not possess minds, but they alter how we read, write, and make meaning, compelling us to reconsider the foundations of language, interpretation, and the role of artificial systems in the production of knowledge.

      In recent years, Large-Language-Model-driven AI agents have exhibited unprecedented intelligence and adaptability, and are rapidly changing human production and life. Nowadays, agents are undergoing a new round of evolution. They no longer act as an isolated island like LLMs. Instead, they start to communicate with diverse external entities, such as other agents and tools, to perform more complex tasks collectively. Under this trend, agent communication is regarded as a foundational pillar of the future AI ecosystem, and many organizations have intensively begun to design related communication protocols (e.g., Anthropic's MCP and Google's A2A) within the recent few months. However, this new field exposes significant security hazards, which can cause severe damage to real-world scenarios. To help researchers quickly figure out this promising topic and benefit the future agent communication development, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of agent communication security. More precisely, we first present a clear definition of agent communication and categorize the entire lifecycle of agent communication into three stages: user-agent interaction, agent-agent communication, and agent-environment communication. Next, for each communication phase, we dissect related protocols and analyze the security risks according to the communication characteristics. Then, we summarize and outlook on the possible defense countermeasures for each risk. In addition, we conduct experiments using MCP and A2A to help readers better understand the novel vulnerabilities brought by agent communication. Finally, we discuss open issues and future directions in this promising research field.

      We address the detection of emission reduction goals in corporate reports, an important task for monitoring companies' progress in addressing climate change. Specifically, we focus on the issue of integrating expert feedback in the form of labeled example passages into LLM-based pipelines, and compare the two strategies of (1) a dynamic selection of few-shot examples and (2) the automatic optimization of the prompt by the LLM itself. Our findings on a public dataset of 769 climate-related passages from real-world business reports indicate that automatic prompt optimization is the superior approach, while combining both methods provides only limited benefit. Qualitative results indicate that optimized prompts do indeed capture many intricacies of the targeted emission goal extraction task.

      With the increasing interest in robotic synthesis in the context of organic chemistry, the automated extraction of chemical procedures from literature is critical. However, this task remains challenging due to the inherent ambiguity of chemical language and the high cost of human annotation required for developing reliable computer-aided extraction protocols. Here, we present ChemActor, a fully fine-tuned large language model (LLM), as a chemical executor to convert between unstructured experimental procedures and structured action sequences. We propose a sequential LLM-generated data framework to address the challenges of insufficient and low-quality annotated data. This framework integrates a data selection module that selects data based on distribution divergence, with a general-purpose LLM, to generate machine-executable actions from a single molecule input. Additionally, we introduce a novel multi-round LLMs circle review metric, which reflects the model's advanced understanding of chemical experimental procedures. Extensive experiments on reaction-to-description (R2D) and description-to-action (D2A) tasks demonstrate that ChemActor, augmented by LLM-generated data, achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the baseline model by 10%.

      Large Language models (LLMs) have been prominent for language translation, including low-resource languages. There has been limited study on the assessment of the quality of translations generated by LLMs, including Gemini, GPT, and Google Translate. This study addresses this limitation by using semantic and sentiment analysis of selected LLMs for Indian languages, including Sanskrit, Telugu and Hindi. We select prominent texts (Bhagavad Gita, Tamas and Maha Prasthanam ) that have been well translated by experts and use LLMs to generate their translations into English, and provide a comparison with selected expert (human) translations. Our investigation revealed that while LLMs have made significant progress in translation accuracy, challenges remain in preserving sentiment and semantic integrity, especially in metaphorical and philosophical contexts for texts such as the Bhagavad Gita. The sentiment analysis revealed that GPT models are better at preserving the sentiment polarity for the given texts when compared to human (expert) translation. The results revealed that GPT models are generally better at maintaining the sentiment and semantics when compared to Google Translate. This study could help in the development of accurate and culturally sensitive translation systems for large language models.

      Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in assisting scientific research, yet their ability to discover high-quality research hypotheses remains unexamined due to the lack of a dedicated benchmark. To address this gap, we introduce the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating LLMs with a near-sufficient set of sub-tasks of scientific discovery: inspiration retrieval, hypothesis composition, and hypothesis ranking. We develop an automated framework that extracts critical components - research questions, background surveys, inspirations, and hypotheses - from scientific papers across 12 disciplines, with expert validation confirming its accuracy. To prevent data contamination, we focus exclusively on papers published in 2024, ensuring minimal overlap with LLM pretraining data. Our evaluation reveals that LLMs perform well in retrieving inspirations, an out-of-distribution task, suggesting their ability to surface novel knowledge associations. This positions LLMs as "research hypothesis mines", capable of facilitating automated scientific discovery by generating innovative hypotheses at scale with minimal human intervention.

      The deployment of large language models (LLMs) is largely hindered by their large number of parameters. Structural pruning has emerged as a promising solution. Prior structured pruning methods directly remove unimportant parameters based on certain metrics, which often causes knowledge loss and necessitates extensive retraining. To overcome this, we introduce a novel pruning method TRSP: Two-Stage Regularization-Based Structured Pruning for LLMs. Specifically, we multiply the output of each transformer layer by an initial learnable weight and iteratively learn these weights by adding their $\ell_1$-norm as a regularization term to the loss function, serving as the first-stage regularization. Subsequently, we apply additional regularization to the difference between the output and input of layers with smaller weights, encouraging the shift of knowledge to the preserved layers. This serves as the second-stage regularization. TRSP retains more knowledge and better preserves model performance than direct parameter elimination. Through extensive experimentation we show that TRSP outperforms strong layer-wise structured pruning methods without requiring retraining. As a layer-wise pruning method, it delivers notable end-to-end acceleration, making it a promising solution for efficient LLM deployment.

      The rapidly increasing size of large language models (LLMs) presents significant challenges in memory usage and computational costs. Quantizing both weights and activations can address these issues, with hardware-supported fine-grained scaling emerging as a promising solution to mitigate outliers. However, existing methods struggle to capture nuanced block data distributions. We propose BlockDialect, a block-wise fine-grained mixed format technique that assigns a per-block optimal number format from a formatbook for better data representation. Additionally, we introduce DialectFP4, a formatbook of FP4 variants (akin to dialects) that adapt to diverse data distributions. To leverage this efficiently, we propose a two-stage approach for online DialectFP4 activation quantization. Importantly, DialectFP4 ensures energy efficiency by selecting representable values as scaled integers compatible with low-precision integer arithmetic. BlockDialect achieves 10.78% (7.48%) accuracy gain on the LLaMA3-8B (LLaMA2-7B) model compared to MXFP4 format with lower bit usage per data, while being only 5.45% (2.69%) below full precision even when quantizing full-path matrix multiplication. Focusing on how to represent over how to scale, our work presents a promising path for energy-efficient LLM inference.

      We present Junk DNA Hypothesis by adopting a novel task-centric angle for the pre-trained weights of large language models (LLMs). It has been believed that weights in LLMs contain significant redundancy, leading to the conception that a considerable chunk of the parameters can be removed by pruning without compromising performance. Contrary to this belief, this paper presents a counter-argument: small-magnitude weights of pre-trained model weights encode vital knowledge essential for tackling difficult downstream tasks - manifested as the monotonic relationship between the performance drop of downstream tasks across the difficulty spectrum, as we prune more pre-trained weights by magnitude. Moreover, we reveal that these seemingly inconsequential weights can result in irreparable loss of knowledge and performance degradation in difficult tasks, even when downstream continual training is allowed. Interestingly, our evaluations show that the other popular compression, namely quantization, fails to exhibit similar monotonic effect and does not as convincingly disentangle this task-difficulty information. To study formally, we introduce several quantifiable metrics to gauge the downstream task difficulty: (1) within the same task category, and (2) across different task categories. Our extensive experiments substantiate the Junk DNA Hypothesis across a diverse range of model sizes, tasks, datasets, and even pruning methods.

      Stochastic gradient-based descent (SGD), have long been central to training large language models (LLMs). However, their effectiveness is increasingly being questioned, particularly in large-scale applications where empirical evidence suggests potential performance limitations. In response, this paper proposes a stochastic conjugate subgradient method together with adaptive sampling tailored specifically for training LLMs. The method not only achieves faster convergence per iteration but also demonstrates improved scalability compared to traditional SGD techniques. It leverages sample complexity analysis to adaptively choose the sample size, employs a stochastic conjugate subgradient approach to determine search directions and utilizing an AdamW-like algorithm to adaptively adjust step sizes. This approach preserves the key advantages of first-order methods while effectively addressing the nonconvexity and non-smoothness inherent in LLMs training. Additionally, we provide a detailed analysis of the advantage of the algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed method not only maintains, but in many cases surpasses, the scalability of traditional SGD techniques, significantly enhancing both the speed and accuracy of the optimization process.
