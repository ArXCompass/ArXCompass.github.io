      Despite significant advancements in adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for radiology report generation (RRG), clinical adoption remains challenging due to difficulties in accurately mapping pathological and anatomical features to their corresponding text descriptions. Additionally, semantic agnostic feature extraction further hampers the generation of accurate diagnostic reports. To address these challenges, we introduce Medical Concept Aligned Radiology Report Generation (MCA-RG), a knowledge-driven framework that explicitly aligns visual features with distinct medical concepts to enhance the report generation process. MCA-RG utilizes two curated concept banks: a pathology bank containing lesion-related knowledge, and an anatomy bank with anatomical descriptions. The visual features are aligned with these medical concepts and undergo tailored enhancement. We further propose an anatomy-based contrastive learning procedure to improve the generalization of anatomical features, coupled with a matching loss for pathological features to prioritize clinically relevant regions. Additionally, a feature gating mechanism is employed to filter out low-quality concept features. Finally, the visual features are corresponding to individual medical concepts, and are leveraged to guide the report generation process. Experiments on two public benchmarks (MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus) demonstrate that MCA-RG achieves superior performance, highlighting its effectiveness in radiology report generation.

      While large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong potential in solving planning problems, there is a trade-off between flexibility and complexity. LLMs, as zero-shot planners themselves, are still not capable of directly generating valid plans for complex planning problems such as multi-constraint or long-horizon tasks. On the other hand, many frameworks aiming to solve complex planning problems often rely on task-specific preparatory efforts, such as task-specific in-context examples and pre-defined critics/verifiers, which limits their cross-task generalization capability. In this paper, we tackle these challenges by observing that the core of many planning problems lies in optimization problems: searching for the optimal solution (best plan) with goals subject to constraints (preconditions and effects of decisions). With LLMs' commonsense, reasoning, and programming capabilities, this opens up the possibilities of a universal LLM-based approach to planning problems. Inspired by this observation, we propose LLMFP, a general-purpose framework that leverages LLMs to capture key information from planning problems and formally formulate and solve them as optimization problems from scratch, with no task-specific examples needed. We apply LLMFP to 9 planning problems, ranging from multi-constraint decision making to multi-step planning problems, and demonstrate that LLMFP achieves on average 83.7% and 86.8% optimal rate across 9 tasks for GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, significantly outperforming the best baseline (direct planning with OpenAI o1-preview) with 37.6% and 40.7% improvements. We also validate components of LLMFP with ablation experiments and analyzed the underlying success and failure reasons. Project page: https://sites.google.com/view/llmfp.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in code generation, particularly when augmented with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting techniques. They break down requirements into intermediate reasoning steps, which act as design rationales to guide LLMs in writing code like human programmers. Thus, the quality of these steps is crucial for ensuring the correctness and reliability of the generated code. However, little is known about the quality of CoT generated by LLMs. To what extent can we trust the thoughts generated by LLMs? How good are they? This paper empirically explores the external and internal factors of why LLMs generate unsatisfactory CoTs by analyzing 1,023 failed code samples on two widely used code generation benchmarks. We also evaluate their impact on code generation performance by analyzing 210 CoT-code pairs and refining the unsatisfied CoTs by prompting LLMs. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) External factors (53.60%), such as unclear requirements and lack of context, mainly affect CoT quality, while internal factors (40.10%) stem from LLMs' misunderstanding prompts. (2) Even when CoTs are correct, 18.5% of the generated code contains errors due to instruction-following issues; conversely, 11.90% of correct code is paired with flawed CoTs. (3) Refining low-quality CoTs is feasible, i.e., LLMs improve when given detailed problem descriptions. These findings highlight key challenges in CoT-based code generation and suggest directions for improving LLM reasoning and reliability.

      Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved notable success in code-generation benchmarks such as HumanEval and LiveCodeBench. However, a detailed examination reveals that these evaluation suites often comprise only a limited number of homogeneous test cases, resulting in subtle faults going undetected. This not only artificially inflates measured performance but also compromises accurate reward estimation in reinforcement learning frameworks utilizing verifiable rewards (RLVR). To address these critical shortcomings, we systematically investigate the test-case generation (TCG) task by proposing multi-dimensional metrics designed to rigorously quantify test-suite thoroughness. Furthermore, we introduce a human-LLM collaborative method (SAGA), leveraging human programming expertise with LLM reasoning capability, aimed at significantly enhancing both the coverage and the quality of generated test cases. In addition, we develop a TCGBench to facilitate the study of the TCG task. Experiments show that SAGA achieves a detection rate of 90.62% and a verifier accuracy of 32.58% on TCGBench. The Verifier Accuracy (Verifier Acc) of the code generation evaluation benchmark synthesized by SAGA is 10.78% higher than that of LiveCodeBench-v6. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. We hope this work contributes to building a scalable foundation for reliable LLM code evaluation, further advancing RLVR in code generation, and paving the way for automated adversarial test synthesis and adaptive benchmark integration.

      Tutoring dialogues have gained significant attention in recent years, given the prominence of online learning and the emerging tutoring abilities of artificial intelligence (AI) agents powered by large language models (LLMs). Recent studies have shown that the strategies used by tutors can have significant effects on student outcomes, necessitating methods to predict how tutors will behave and how their actions impact students. However, few works have studied predicting tutor strategy in dialogues. Therefore, in this work we investigate the ability of modern LLMs, particularly Llama 3 and GPT-4o, to predict both future tutor moves and student outcomes in dialogues, using two math tutoring dialogue datasets. We find that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to predict future tutor strategy while tutor strategy is highly indicative of student outcomes, outlining a need for more powerful methods to approach this task.

      The rapid adoption of Large Language Model (LLM) agents and multi-agent systems enables unprecedented capabilities in natural language processing and generation. However, these systems have introduced unprecedented security vulnerabilities that extend beyond traditional prompt injection attacks. This paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of LLM agents as attack vectors capable of achieving complete computer takeover through the exploitation of trust boundaries within agentic AI systems where autonomous entities interact and influence each other. We demonstrate that adversaries can leverage three distinct attack surfaces - direct prompt injection, RAG backdoor attacks, and inter-agent trust exploitation - to coerce popular LLMs (including GPT-4o, Claude-4 and Gemini-2.5) into autonomously installing and executing malware on victim machines. Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals an alarming vulnerability hierarchy: while 41.2% of models succumb to direct prompt injection, 52.9% are vulnerable to RAG backdoor attacks, and a critical 82.4% can be compromised through inter-agent trust exploitation. Notably, we discovered that LLMs which successfully resist direct malicious commands will execute identical payloads when requested by peer agents, revealing a fundamental flaw in current multi-agent security models. Our findings demonstrate that only 5.9% of tested models (1/17) proved resistant to all attack vectors, with the majority exhibiting context-dependent security behaviors that create exploitable blind spots. Our findings also highlight the need to increase awareness and research on the security risks of LLMs, showing a paradigm shift in cybersecurity threats, where AI tools themselves become sophisticated attack vectors.

      Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) for large language model (LLM) fine-tuning show promise in addressing multi-objective tasks but still face significant challenges, including competing objective balancing, low training efficiency, poor scalability, and limited explainability. Leveraging ensemble learning principles, we introduce an Ensemble Multi-Objective RL (EMORL) framework that fine-tunes multiple models with individual objectives while optimizing their aggregation after the fine-tuning to improve efficiency and flexibility. Our method is the first to aggregate the hidden states of individual models, incorporating contextual information from multiple objectives. This approach is supported by a hierarchical grid search algorithm that identifies optimal weighted combinations. We evaluate EMORL on counselor reflection generation tasks, using text classification models to score the generations and provide rewards during RL fine-tuning. Through comprehensive experiments on the PAIR and Psych8k datasets, we demonstrate the advantages of EMORL against existing baselines: significantly lower and more stable training consumption ($17,529\pm 1,650$ data points and $6,573\pm 147.43$ seconds), improved scalability and explainability, and comparable performance across multiple objectives.

      Hyper-parameters are essential and critical for the performance of communication algorithms. However, current hyper-parameters optimization approaches for Warm-Start Particles Swarm Optimization with Crossover and Mutation (WS-PSO-CM) algorithm, designed for radio map-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory and communication, are primarily heuristic-based, exhibiting low levels of automation and improvable performance. In this paper, we design an Large Language Model (LLM) agent for automatic hyper-parameters-tuning, where an iterative framework and Model Context Protocol (MCP) are applied. In particular, the LLM agent is first set up via a profile, which specifies the boundary of hyper-parameters, task objective, terminal condition, conservative or aggressive strategy of optimizing hyper-parameters, and LLM configurations. Then, the LLM agent iteratively invokes WS-PSO-CM algorithm for exploration. Finally, the LLM agent exits the loop based on the terminal condition and returns an optimized set of hyperparameters. Our experiment results show that the minimal sum-rate achieved by hyper-parameters generated via our LLM agent is significantly higher than those by both human heuristics and random generation methods. This indicates that an LLM agent with PSO and WS-PSO-CM algorithm knowledge is useful in seeking high-performance hyper-parameters.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed as automated evaluators to assess the safety of generated content, yet their reliability in this role remains uncertain. This study evaluates a diverse set of 11 LLM judge models across critical safety domains, examining three key aspects: self-consistency in repeated judging tasks, alignment with human judgments, and susceptibility to input artifacts such as apologetic or verbose phrasing. Our findings reveal that biases in LLM judges can significantly distort the final verdict on which content source is safer, undermining the validity of comparative evaluations. Notably, apologetic language artifacts alone can skew evaluator preferences by up to 98\%. Contrary to expectations, larger models do not consistently exhibit greater robustness, while smaller models sometimes show higher resistance to specific artifacts. To mitigate LLM evaluator robustness issues, we investigate jury-based evaluations aggregating decisions from multiple models. Although this approach both improves robustness and enhances alignment to human judgements, artifact sensitivity persists even with the best jury configurations. These results highlight the urgent need for diversified, artifact-resistant methodologies to ensure reliable safety assessments.

      Despite the growing interest in jailbreak methods as an effective red-teaming tool for building safe and responsible large language models (LLMs), flawed evaluation system designs have led to significant discrepancies in their effectiveness assessments. We conduct a systematic measurement study based on 37 jailbreak studies since 2022, focusing on both the methods and the evaluation systems they employ. We find that existing evaluation systems lack case-specific criteria, resulting in misleading conclusions about their effectiveness and safety implications. This paper advocates a shift to a more nuanced, case-by-case evaluation paradigm. We introduce GuidedBench, a novel benchmark comprising a curated harmful question dataset, detailed case-by-case evaluation guidelines and an evaluation system integrated with these guidelines -- GuidedEval. Experiments demonstrate that GuidedBench offers more accurate measurements of jailbreak performance, enabling meaningful comparisons across methods and uncovering new insights overlooked in previous evaluations. GuidedEval reduces inter-evaluator variance by at least 76.03\%. Furthermore, we observe that incorporating guidelines can enhance the effectiveness of jailbreak methods themselves, offering new insights into both attack strategies and evaluation paradigms.

      Automated text evaluation has long been a central issue in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Recently, the field has shifted toward using Large Language Models (LLMs) as evaluators-a trend known as the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm. While promising and easily adaptable across tasks, this approach has seen limited exploration in multilingual contexts. Existing multilingual studies often rely on proprietary models or require extensive training data for fine-tuning, raising concerns about cost, time, and efficiency. In this paper, we propose Checklist Engineering based LLM-as-a-Judge (CE-Judge), a training-free framework that uses checklist intuition for multilingual evaluation with an open-source model. Experiments across multiple languages and three benchmark datasets, under both pointwise and pairwise settings, show that our method generally surpasses the baselines and performs on par with the GPT-4o model.

      To guarantee safe and robust deployment of large language models (LLMs) at scale, it is critical to accurately assess their adversarial robustness. Existing adversarial attacks typically target harmful responses in single-point, greedy generations, overlooking the inherently stochastic nature of LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for adversarial robustness evaluation that explicitly models the entire output distribution, including tail-risks, providing better estimates for model robustness at scale. By casting the attack process as a resource allocation problem between optimization and sampling, we determine compute-optimal tradeoffs and show that integrating sampling into existing attacks boosts ASR by up to 48% and improves efficiency by up to two orders of magnitude. Our framework also enables us to analyze how different attack algorithms affect output harm distributions. Surprisingly, we find that most optimization strategies have little effect on output harmfulness. Finally, we introduce a data-free proof-of-concept objective based on entropy-maximization to demonstrate how our tail-aware perspective enables new optimization targets. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of tail-aware attacks and evaluation protocols to accurately assess and strengthen LLM safety.

      Semantic conflicts arise when a developer introduces changes to a codebase that unintentionally affect the behavior of changes integrated in parallel by other developers. Traditional merge tools are unable to detect such conflicts, so complementary tools like SMAT have been proposed. SMAT relies on generating and executing unit tests: if a test fails on the base version, passes on a developer's modified version, but fails again after merging with another developer's changes, a semantic conflict is indicated. While SMAT is effective at detecting conflicts, it suffers from a high rate of false negatives, partly due to the limitations of unit test generation tools such as Randoop and Evosuite. To investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can overcome these limitations, we propose and integrate a new test generation tool based on Code Llama 70B into SMAT. We explore the model's ability to generate tests using different interaction strategies, prompt contents, and parameter configurations. Our evaluation uses two samples: a benchmark with simpler systems from related work, and a more significant sample based on complex, real-world systems. We assess the effectiveness of the new SMAT extension in detecting conflicts. Results indicate that, although LLM-based test generation remains challenging and computationally expensive in complex scenarios, there is promising potential for improving semantic conflict detection. -- Conflitos sem^anticos surgem quando um desenvolvedor introduz mudan\c{c}as em uma base de c\'odigo que afetam, de forma n~ao intencional, o comportamento de altera\c{c}~oes integradas em paralelo por outros desenvolvedores.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown to be effective evaluators across various domains such as machine translations or the scientific domain.

To address this, we present Knockout Assessment, an LLM-asa Judge method using a knockout tournament system with iterative pairwise comparisons. Experiments across three LLMs on two datasets show that knockout assessment improves scoring accuracy, increasing Pearson correlation with expert evaluations by 0.07 on average for university-level exam scoring and machine translation evaluations, aligning LLM assessments more closely with human scoring.

      The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new opportunities in recommender systems by enabling zero-shot recommendation without conventional training. Despite their potential, most existing works rely solely on users' purchase histories, leaving significant room for improvement by incorporating user-generated textual data, such as reviews and product descriptions. Addressing this gap, we propose PURE, a novel LLM-based recommendation framework that builds and maintains evolving user profiles by systematically extracting and summarizing key information from user reviews. PURE consists of three core components: a Review Extractor for identifying user preferences and key product features, a Profile Updater for refining and updating user profiles, and a Recommender for generating personalized recommendations using the most current profile. To evaluate PURE, we introduce a continuous sequential recommendation task that reflects real-world scenarios by adding reviews over time and updating predictions incrementally. Our experimental results on Amazon datasets demonstrate that PURE outperforms existing LLM-based methods, effectively leveraging long-term user information while managing token limitations.

      Open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding aims to localize target objects based on free-form language queries, which is crucial for embodied AI applications such as autonomous navigation, robotics, and augmented reality. Learning 3D language fields through neural representations enables accurate understanding of 3D scenes from limited viewpoints and facilitates the localization of target objects in complex environments. However, existing language field methods struggle to accurately localize instances using spatial relations in language queries, such as ``the book on the chair.'' This limitation mainly arises from inadequate reasoning about spatial relations in both language queries and 3D scenes. In this work, we propose SpatialReasoner, a novel neural representation-based framework with large language model (LLM)-driven spatial reasoning that constructs a visual properties-enhanced hierarchical feature field for open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding. To enable spatial reasoning in language queries, SpatialReasoner fine-tunes an LLM to capture spatial relations and explicitly infer instructions for the target, anchor, and spatial relation. To enable spatial reasoning in 3D scenes, SpatialReasoner incorporates visual properties (opacity and color) to construct a hierarchical feature field. This field represents language and instance features using distilled CLIP features and masks extracted via the Segment Anything Model (SAM). The field is then queried using the inferred instructions in a hierarchical manner to localize the target 3D instance based on the spatial relation in the language query. Extensive experiments show that our framework can be seamlessly integrated into different neural representations, outperforming baseline models in 3D visual grounding while empowering their spatial reasoning capability.

      Large language models (LLMs), including zero-shot and few-shot paradigms, have shown promising capabilities in clinical text generation. However, real-world applications face two key challenges: (1) patient data is highly unstructured, heterogeneous, and scattered across multiple note types and (2) clinical notes are often long and semantically dense, making naive prompting infeasible due to context length constraints and the risk of omitting clinically relevant information. We introduce CLI-RAG (Clinically Informed Retrieval-Augmented Generation), a domain-specific framework for structured and clinically grounded text generation using LLMs. It incorporates a novel hierarchical chunking strategy that respects clinical document structure and introduces a task-specific dual-stage retrieval mechanism. The global stage identifies relevant note types using evidence-based queries, while the local stage extracts high-value content within those notes creating relevance at both document and section levels. We apply the system to generate structured progress notes for individual hospital visits using 15 clinical note types from the MIMIC-III dataset. Experiments show that it preserves temporal and semantic alignment across visits, achieving an average alignment score of 87.7%, surpassing the 80.7% baseline from real clinician-authored notes. The generated outputs also demonstrate high consistency across LLMs, reinforcing deterministic behavior essential for reproducibility, reliability, and clinical trust.

      Query rewrite transforms SQL queries into semantically equivalent forms that run more efficiently. Existing approaches mainly rely on predefined rewrite rules, but they handle a limited subset of queries and can cause performance regressions. This limitation stems from three challenges of rule-based query rewrite: (1) it is hard to discover and verify new rules, (2) fixed rewrite rules do not generalize to new query patterns, and (3) some rewrite techniques cannot be expressed as fixed rules. Motivated by the fact that human experts exhibit significantly better rewrite ability but suffer from scalability, and Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated nearly human-level semantic and reasoning abilities, we propose a new approach of using LLMs to rewrite SQL queries beyond rules. Due to the hallucination problems in LLMs, directly applying LLMs often leads to nonequivalent and suboptimal queries. To address this issue, we propose QUITE (query rewrite), a training-free and feedback-aware system based on LLM agents that rewrites SQL queries into semantically equivalent forms with significantly better performance, covering a broader range of query patterns and rewrite strategies compared to rule-based methods. Firstly, we design a multi-agent framework controlled by a finite state machine (FSM) to equip LLMs with the ability to use external tools and enhance the rewrite process with real-time database feedback. Secondly, we develop a rewrite middleware to enhance the ability of LLMs to generate optimized query equivalents. Finally, we employ a novel hint injection technique to improve execution plans for rewritten queries. Extensive experiments show that QUITE reduces query execution time by up to 35.8% over state-of-the-art approaches and produces 24.1% more rewrites than prior methods, covering query cases that earlier systems did not handle.

      Resolution of complex SQL issues persists as a significant bottleneck in real-world database applications. Current Large Language Models (LLMs), while adept at text-to-SQL translation, have not been rigorously evaluated on the more challenging task of debugging SQL issues. To address this gap, we introduce BIRD-CRITIC, a new SQL issue debugging benchmark comprising 530 PostgreSQL tasks (BIRD-CRITIC-PG) and 570 multi-dialect tasks (BIRD-CRITIC-Multi), distilled from authentic user issues and replayed within new environments to facilitate rigorous evaluation. Baseline evaluations underscore the task's complexity, with the leading reasoning model O3-Mini achieving only 38.87% success rate on BIRD-CRITIC-PG and 33.33% on BIRD-CRITIC-Multi. Meanwhile, advancing open-source models for database tasks is crucial for empowering local development while safeguarding data privacy. Therefore, we present Six-Gym (Sql-fIX-Gym), a training environment for elevating open-source model capabilities for SQL issue debugging. This environment leverages SQL-Rewind strategy, which automatically generates executable issue-solution datasets by reverse-engineering issues from verified SQLs. However, popular trajectory-based fine-tuning methods do not explore substantial supervisory signals. We further propose f-Plan Boosting, which extracts high-level debugging plans from SQL solutions, enabling teacher LLMs to produce 73.7% more successful trajectories for training. We integrate these components into an open-source agent, Bird-Fixer. Based on Qwen-2.5-Coder-14B, Bird-Fixer achieves 38.11% success rate on BIRD-CRITIC-PG and 29.65% on BIRD-CRITIC-Multi, surpassing leading proprietary models such as Claude-3.7-Sonnet and GPT-4.1, marking a significant step toward democratizing sophisticated SQL-debugging capabilities.

      The data extraction stages of reviews are resource-intensive, and researchers may seek to expediate data extraction using online (large language models) LLMs and review protocols. Claude 3.5 Sonnet was used to trial two approaches that used a review protocol to prompt data extraction from 10 evidence sources included in a case study scoping review. A protocol-based approach was also used to review extracted data. Limited performance evaluation was undertaken which found high accuracy for the two extraction approaches (83.3% and 100%) when extracting simple, well-defined citation details; accuracy was lower (9.6% and 15.8%) when extracting more complex, subjective data items. Considering all data items, both approaches had precision >90% but low recall (<25%) and F1 scores (<40%). The context of a complex scoping review, open response types and methodological approach likely impacted performance due to missed and misattributed data. LLM feedback considered the baseline extraction accurate and suggested minor amendments: four of 15 (26.7%) to citation details and 8 of 38 (21.1%) to key findings data items were considered to potentially add value. However, when repeating the process with a dataset featuring deliberate errors, only 2 of 39 (5%) errors were detected. Review-protocol-based methods used for expediency require more robust performance evaluation across a range of LLMs and review contexts with comparison to conventional prompt engineering approaches. We recommend researchers evaluate and report LLM performance if using them similarly to conduct data extraction or review extracted data. LLM feedback contributed to protocol adaptation and may assist future review protocol drafting.

      Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently advanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While prior work has emphasized algorithmic design, data curation, and reward shaping, we investigate RLVR from a sample-centric perspective and introduce LPPO (Learning-Progress and Prefix-guided Optimization), a framework of progressive optimization techniques. Our work addresses a critical question: how to best leverage a small set of trusted, high-quality demonstrations, rather than simply scaling up data volume. First, motivated by how hints aid human problem-solving, we propose prefix-guided sampling, an online data augmentation method that incorporates partial solution prefixes from expert demonstrations to guide the policy, particularly for challenging instances. Second, inspired by how humans focus on important questions aligned with their current capabilities, we introduce learning-progress weighting, a dynamic strategy that adjusts each training sample's influence based on model progression. We estimate sample-level learning progress via an exponential moving average of per-sample pass rates, promoting samples that foster learning and de-emphasizing stagnant ones. Experiments on mathematical-reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our methods outperform strong baselines, yielding faster convergence and a higher performance ceiling.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various NLP tasks but struggle with code-mixed (or code-switched) language understanding. For example, prior work benchmarking the performance of multilingual LLMs on code-mixed translation tasks has demonstrated that current state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs are ineffective in dealing with code-mixed languages. However, the question of how to improve the capability of multilingual LLMs to handle code-mixed language has not received any attention to date. In this paper, we tackle this research gap by proposing CHAI, a novel general-purpose framework for improving the ability of multilingual LLMs to handle code-mixed languages. CHAI relies on three novel contributions made in this paper. First, we explore the ability of LLMs to provide accurate annotations for code-mixed translation tasks. Second, we leverage this ability of LLMs as annotators to generate preference data for code-mixed translation tasks at scale, which are then used within a reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF) procedure to improve LLMs' capability on code-mixed tasks. Third, we conduct a rigorous experimental evaluation across various real-world datasets and settings. Our analysis shows that CHAI-powered LLMs outperform state-of-the-art open-source LLMs by 25.66% (in terms of win rate adjudicated by human annotators) in code-mixed translation tasks. This work represents a first step towards developing more inclusive code-mixed LLMs.

      Large-language models turn writing into a live exchange between humans and software. We capture this new medium with a discursive-network model that treats people and LLMs as equal nodes and tracks how their statements circulate. Broadening the focus from isolated hallucinations, we define invalidation (any factual, logical, or structural breach) and show it follows four hazards: drift from truth, self-repair, fresh fabrication, and external detection. A general mathematical model of discursive networks is developed to provide valuable insights: A network governed only by drift and self-repair stabilizes at a modest error rate; adding fabrication reproduces the high rates seen in current LLMs. Giving each false claim even a small chance of peer review shifts the system to a truth-dominant state. We operationalize peer review with the open-source \emph{Flaws-of-Others (FOO) algorithm}: a configurable loop in which any set of agents critique one another while a harmoniser merges their verdicts. The takeaway is practical and cultural: reliability in this new medium comes not from perfecting single models but from wiring imperfect ones into networks that keep each other honest.

      Large Language Model (LLM) services fundamentally differ from traditional Deep Neural Network (DNN) applications in wireless networks. We identify three critical distinctions: (1) unlike traditional DNNs with unidirectional data flows, LLM's multimodal interactions create bidirectional heavy loads with contrasting bottlenecks, requiring direction-aware resource scheduling; (2) while traditional DNNs exhibit fixed computational patterns, LLM's highly variable inference times interact complexly with network slicing, causing dynamic bottleneck migration; and (3) in contrast to predictable DNN traffic, LLM's token streams demonstrate unprecedented burstiness and state dependencies. These insights motivate WiLLM, the first open-source framework, implemented as a wireless platform, for LLM service research. Built on OpenAirInterface, WiLLM introduces several technical innovations: dynamic slice compatibility, universal UE compatibility through application-layer tunneling, multi-UE multi-slice scheduling, dual-mode resource allocation, and cross-layer APIs. In addition, WiLLM eliminates the need for specialized wireless expertise, enabling researchers and developers to experiment with LLM services over realistic cellular networks. We demonstrate the platform's capabilities through a smart glasses case study and provide a comprehensive dataset of \~1.6 million synchronized measurements.

      Current financial large language models (FinLLMs) struggle with two critical limitations: the absence of objective evaluation metrics to assess the quality of stock analysis reports and a lack of depth in stock analysis, which impedes their ability to generate professional-grade insights. To address these challenges, this paper introduces FinSphere, a stock analysis agent, along with three major contributions: (1) AnalyScore, a systematic evaluation framework for assessing stock analysis quality, (2) Stocksis, a dataset curated by industry experts to enhance LLMs' stock analysis capabilities, and (3) FinSphere, an AI agent that can generate high-quality stock analysis reports in response to user queries. Experiments demonstrate that FinSphere achieves superior performance compared to both general and domain-specific LLMs, as well as existing agent-based systems, even when they are enhanced with real-time data access and few-shot guidance. The integrated framework, which combines real-time data feeds, quantitative tools, and an instruction-tuned LLM, yields substantial improvements in both analytical quality and practical applicability for real-world stock analysis.

      Existing approaches to mathematical reasoning with large language models (LLMs) rely on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for generalizability or Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) for precise computation. While efforts have been made to combine these methods, they primarily rely on post-selection or predefined strategies, leaving an open question: whether LLMs can autonomously adapt their reasoning strategy based on their inherent capabilities. In this work, we propose TATA (Teaching LLMs According to Their Aptitude), an adaptive framework that enables LLMs to personalize their reasoning strategy spontaneously, aligning it with their intrinsic aptitude. TATA incorporates base-LLM-aware data selection during supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to tailor training data to the model's unique abilities. This approach equips LLMs to autonomously determine and apply the appropriate reasoning strategy at test time. We evaluate TATA through extensive experiments on six mathematical reasoning benchmarks, using both general-purpose and math-specialized LLMs. Empirical results demonstrate that TATA effectively combines the complementary strengths of CoT and TIR, achieving superior or comparable performance with improved inference efficiency compared to TIR alone. Further analysis underscores the critical role of aptitude-aware data selection in enabling LLMs to make effective and adaptive reasoning decisions and align reasoning strategies with model capabilities.

At its core, Gradientsys employs an LLM-powered scheduler for intelligent one-to-many task dispatch, enabling parallel execution of heterogeneous agents such as PDF parsers, web search modules, GUI controllers, and web builders. The framework supports hybrid synchronous/asynchronous execution, respects agent capacity constraints, and incorporates a robust retry-and-replan mechanism to handle failures gracefully. To promote transparency and trust, Gradientsys includes an observability layer streaming real-time agent activity and intermediate reasoning via Server-Sent Events (SSE). We offer an architectural overview and evaluate Gradientsys against existing frameworks in terms of extensibility, scheduling topology, tool reusability, parallelism, and observability. Experiments on the GAIA general-assistant benchmark show that Gradientsys achieves higher task success rates with reduced latency and lower API costs compared to a MinionS-style baseline, demonstrating the strength of its LLM-driven multi-agent orchestration.

      The exponential growth of social media and generative AI has transformed information dissemination, fostering connectivity but also accelerating the spread of misinformation. Understanding information propagation dynamics and developing effective control strategies is essential to mitigate harmful content. Traditional models, such as SIR, provide basic insights but inadequately capture the complexities of online interactions. Advanced methods, including attention mechanisms and graph neural networks, enhance accuracy but typically overlook user psychology and behavioral dynamics. Large language models (LLMs), with their human-like reasoning, offer new potential for simulating psychological aspects of information spread. We introduce an LLM-based simulation environment capturing agents' evolving attitudes, emotions, and responses. Initial experiments, however, revealed significant gaps between LLM-generated behaviors and authentic human dynamics, especially in stance detection and psychological realism. A detailed evaluation through Social Information Processing Theory identified major discrepancies in goal-setting and feedback evaluation, stemming from the lack of emotional processing in standard LLM training. To address these issues, we propose the Social Information Processing-based Chain of Thought (SIP-CoT) mechanism enhanced by emotion-guided memory. This method improves the interpretation of social cues, personalization of goals, and evaluation of feedback. Experimental results confirm that SIP-CoT-enhanced LLM agents more effectively process social information, demonstrating behaviors, attitudes, and emotions closer to real human interactions. In summary, this research highlights critical limitations in current LLM-based propagation simulations and demonstrates how integrating SIP-CoT and emotional memory significantly enhances the social intelligence and realism of LLM agents.

      Jailbreak attack can be used to access the vulnerabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by inducing LLMs to generate the harmful content. And the most common method of the attack is to construct semantically ambiguous prompts to confuse and mislead the LLMs. To access the security and reveal the intrinsic relation between the input prompt and the output for LLMs, the distribution of attention weight is introduced to analyze the underlying reasons. By using statistical analysis methods, some novel metrics are defined to better describe the distribution of attention weight, such as the Attention Intensity on Sensitive Words (Attn_SensWords), the Attention-based Contextual Dependency Score (Attn_DepScore) and Attention Dispersion Entropy (Attn_Entropy). By leveraging the distinct characteristics of these metrics, the beam search algorithm and inspired by the military strategy "Feint and Attack", an effective jailbreak attack strategy named as Attention-Based Attack (ABA) is proposed. In the ABA, nested attack prompts are employed to divert the attention distribution of the LLMs. In this manner, more harmless parts of the input can be used to attract the attention of the LLMs. In addition, motivated by ABA, an effective defense strategy called as Attention-Based Defense (ABD) is also put forward. Compared with ABA, the ABD can be used to enhance the robustness of LLMs by calibrating the attention distribution of the input prompt. Some comparative experiments have been given to demonstrate the effectiveness of ABA and ABD. Therefore, both ABA and ABD can be used to access the security of the LLMs. The comparative experiment results also give a logical explanation that the distribution of attention weight can bring great influence on the output for LLMs.

In this work, we formally characterize the KAD framework and uncover a structural vulnerability in its design that invalidates its core security premise. We design a methodical adaptive attack, $\textit{DataFlip}$, to exploit this fundamental weakness.

      Retrieval practice is a well-established pedagogical technique known to significantly enhance student learning and knowledge retention. However, generating high-quality retrieval practice questions is often time-consuming and labor intensive for instructors, especially in rapidly evolving technical subjects. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the potential to automate this process by generating questions in response to prompts, yet the effectiveness of LLM-generated retrieval practice on student learning remains to be established. In this study, we conducted an empirical study involving two college-level data science courses, with approximately 60 students. We compared learning outcomes during one week in which students received LLM-generated multiple-choice retrieval practice questions to those from a week in which no such questions were provided. Results indicate that students exposed to LLM-generated retrieval practice achieved significantly higher knowledge retention, with an average accuracy of 89%, compared to 73% in the week without such practice. These findings suggest that LLM-generated retrieval questions can effectively support student learning and may provide a scalable solution for integrating retrieval practice into real-time teaching. However, despite these encouraging outcomes and the potential time-saving benefits, cautions must be taken, as the quality of LLM-generated questions can vary. Instructors must still manually verify and revise the generated questions before releasing them to students.

      Knowledge distillation typically involves transferring knowledge from a Large Language Model (LLM) to a Smaller Language Model (SLM). However, in tasks such as text matching, fine-tuned smaller models often yield more effective domain-specific representations, as they focus on optimizing the similarity of input pairs. To leverage both the specialized strengths of small models and the rich semantic understanding of LLMs, we introduce a flipped knowledge distillation paradigm, where LLM learns from SLM. Specifically, we address the architectural gap between decoder-only LLMs and smaller encoder-based models by reinterpreting LLMs in an encoder-decoder manner using LoRA. The encoder generates compressed representations, while the decoder maps them to the output space. During training, the encoder produces representations and their similarities, which are then aligned with the similarity scores produced by the teacher, using our proposed Margin-aware Contrastive Learning (MCL) approach. The MCL ensures accurate similarity for both positive and negative pairs, and adaptively handles the internal differences within positive and negative samples. Our paradigm requires only a reasonably good-performing SLM, allowing the LLM to achieve improved performance. Experiments on financial and healthcare benchmarks, as well as real-world applications, confirm its effectiveness, and the model has been fully deployed in an online environment.

      Various techniques have been proposed to improve large language models (LLMs) adherence to formatting and instruction constraints. One of the most effective approaches involves utilizing high-quality data generated by powerful models. However, such models often fail to fully comply with complex instructions in a single generation. To address this limitation, iterative revision methods have been introduced. Nevertheless, as the number of data points and revision iterations increases, the associated monetary costs grow significantly. As a resource-efficient alternative, methods have been proposed that leverage high-performance evaluation tools to compensate for the limited self-evaluation capabilities of open-source LLMs. However, these approaches often lead to a degradation in output quality due to excessive revision. To overcome these challenges, we propose Re5, a self-evaluation and revision framework designed to enhance instruction-following performance while preserving the quality of the generated content. Re5 extracts task and constraint components from user instructions, performs structural evaluations to prevent error accumulation, and applies fine-grained constraint-specific content evaluations followed by selective revisions. This process ensures precise and quality-preserving improvements. The final high-quality outputs are used for alignment tuning, enabling long-term alignment improvements through a data-centric iterative refinement loop. Experimental results demonstrate that Re5 achieves instruction-following performance comparable to models trained on data generated by GPT-4o-mini, a high-performance model, even with a small amount of data while maintaining response quality with a 64.24%-win rate over the non-revised initial responses. These results validate Re5 as an efficient and effective solution for enhancing instruction adherence with minimal external supervision.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet they also exhibit memorization of their training data. This phenomenon raises critical questions about model behavior, privacy risks, and the boundary between learning and memorization. Addressing these concerns, this paper synthesizes recent studies and investigates the landscape of memorization, the factors influencing it, and methods for its detection and mitigation. We explore key drivers, including training data duplication, training dynamics, and fine-tuning procedures that influence data memorization. In addition, we examine methodologies such as prefix-based extraction, membership inference, and adversarial prompting, assessing their effectiveness in detecting and measuring memorized content. Beyond technical analysis, we also explore the broader implications of memorization, including the legal and ethical implications. Finally, we discuss mitigation strategies, including data cleaning, differential privacy, and post-training unlearning, while highlighting open challenges in balancing the minimization of harmful memorization with utility. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of research on LLM memorization across technical, privacy, and performance dimensions, identifying critical directions for future work.

      Biomedical semantic question answering rooted in information retrieval can play a crucial role in keeping up to date with vast, rapidly evolving and ever-growing biomedical literature. A robust system can help researchers, healthcare professionals and even layman users access relevant knowledge grounded in evidence. The BioASQ 2025 Task13b Challenge serves as an important benchmark, offering a competitive platform for advancement of this space. This paper presents the methodologies and results from our participation in this challenge where we built a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that can answer biomedical questions by retrieving relevant PubMed documents and snippets to generate answers. For the retrieval task, we generated dense embeddings from biomedical articles for initial retrieval, and applied an ensemble of finetuned cross-encoders and large language models (LLMs) for re-ranking to identify top relevant documents. Our solution achieved an MAP@10 of 0.1581, placing 10th on the leaderboard for the retrieval task. For answer generation, we employed few-shot prompting of instruction-tuned LLMs. Our system achieved macro-F1 score of 0.95 for yes/no questions (rank 12), Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) of 0.64 for factoid questions (rank 1), mean-F1 score of 0.63 for list questions (rank 5), and ROUGE-SU4 F1 score of 0.29 for ideal answers (rank 11).

      As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents in complex and long horizon settings, it is critical to evaluate their ability to sabotage users by pursuing hidden objectives. We study the ability of frontier LLMs to evade monitoring and achieve harmful hidden goals while completing a wide array of realistic tasks. We evaluate a broad range of frontier LLMs using SHADE (Subtle Harmful Agent Detection & Evaluation)-Arena, the first highly diverse agent evaluation dataset for sabotage and monitoring capabilities of LLM agents. SHADE-Arena consists of complex pairs of benign main tasks and harmful side objectives in complicated environments. Agents are evaluated on their ability to complete the side task without appearing suspicious to an LLM monitor. When measuring agent ability to (a) complete the main task, (b) complete the side task, and (c) avoid detection, we find that the best performing frontier models score 27% (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) and 15% (Gemini 2.5 Pro) as sabotage agents when overseen by Claude 3.6 Sonnet. For current frontier models, success on the side task relies heavily on having access to a hidden scratchpad that is not visible to the monitor. We also use SHADE-Arena to measure models' monitoring abilities, with the top monitor (Gemini 2.5 Pro) achieving an AUC of 0.87 at distinguishing benign and malign transcripts. We find that for now, models still struggle at sabotage due to failures in long-context main task execution. However, our measurements already demonstrate the difficulty of monitoring for subtle sabotage attempts, which we expect to only increase in the face of more complex and longer-horizon tasks.

      Over the last few years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a valuable tool for Electronic Design Automation (EDA). State-of-the-art research in LLM-aided design has demonstrated the ability of LLMs to generate syntactically correct RTL code, showcasing encouraging prospects for integrating AI into the hardware design process. A key enabler of these advancements is the availability of high-quality benchmarks to evaluate new approaches. However, existing datasets and benchmarks fall short of system-level design, as they focus primarily on component-level information and low-complexity designs. To address this gap, we introduce the System-Level Design Benchmark (SLDB), a dataset tailored for evaluating LLMs in system-level integration and configuration tasks. SLDB includes a curated benchmark suite of 10 baseline SoC designs, whose components can be combined into an exponential number of distinct tile-based SoCs through a synthetic library. The dataset provides full SoC configurations, accelerator integration code, communication parameters, and accelerator-aware system configurations, along with testing-application code, compatible with the ESP platform[1].

      The integration of Large Language Model (LLMs) blocks with Vision Transformers (ViTs) holds immense promise for vision-only tasks by leveraging the rich semantic knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, a fundamental challenge lies in the inherent modality mismatch between text-centric pretraining of LLMs and vision-centric training of ViTs. Direct fusion often fails to fully exploit the LLM's potential and suffers from unstable finetuning. As a result, LLM blocks are kept frozen while only the vision components are learned. As a remedy to these challenges, we introduce Language-Unlocked Vision Transformers (LUViT), a novel approach that bridges this modality mismatch through a synergistic pre-training strategy. LUViT co-adapts a ViT backbone and an LLM fusion block by (1) employing Masked Auto-Encoding (MAE) to pre-train the ViT for richer visual representations, and (2) concurrently training Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) layers within the LLM block using the MAE objective. This joint optimization guides the ViT to produce LLM-aligned features and the LLM to effectively interpret visual information. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that LUViT significantly improves performance on various downstream vision tasks, showcasing a more effective and efficient pathway to harness LLM knowledge for visual understanding.

In this work, we present hdl2v ("HDL-to-Verilog"), a dataset which seeks to increase the amount of available human-written Verilog data by translating or compiling three other hardware description languages - VHDL, Chisel, and PyMTL3 - to Verilog. Furthermore, we demonstrate the value of hdl2v in enhancing LLM Verilog generation by improving performance of a 32 billion-parameter open-weight model by up to 23% (pass@10) in VerilogEvalV2, without utilizing any data augmentation or knowledge distillation from larger models. We also show hdl2v's ability to boost the performance of a data augmentation-based fine-tuning approach by 63%. Finally, we characterize and analyze our dataset to better understand which characteristics of HDL-to-Verilog datasets can be expanded upon in future work for even better performance.

      Large Language Model (LLM) agents face security vulnerabilities spanning AI-specific and traditional software domains, yet current research addresses these separately. This study bridges this gap through comparative evaluation of Function Calling architecture and Model Context Protocol (MCP) deployment paradigms using a unified threat classification framework. We tested 3,250 attack scenarios across seven language models, evaluating simple, composed, and chained attacks targeting both AI-specific threats (prompt injection) and software vulnerabilities (JSON injection, denial-of-service). Function Calling showed higher overall attack success rates (73.5% vs 62.59% for MCP), with greater system-centric vulnerability while MCP exhibited increased LLM-centric exposure. Attack complexity dramatically amplified effectiveness, with chained attacks achieving 91-96% success rates. Counterintuitively, advanced reasoning models demonstrated higher exploitability despite better threat detection. Results demonstrate that architectural choices fundamentally reshape threat landscapes. This work establishes methodological foundations for cross-domain LLM agent security assessment and provides evidence-based guidance for secure deployment.

      Transformer-based Language Models' computation and memory overhead increase quadratically as a function of sequence length. The quadratic cost poses challenges when employing LLMs for processing long sequences. In this work, we introduce \ourmodelacronym~(Extend at Test-Time), method for extending the context length of short context Transformer-based LLMs, with constant memory requirement and linear computation overhead. ETT enable the extension of the context length at test-time by efficient fine-tuning the model's parameters on the input context, chunked into overlapping small subsequences. We evaluate ETT on LongBench by extending the context length of GPT-Large and Phi-2 up to 32 times, increasing from 1k to 32k tokens. This results in up to a 30 percent improvement in the model's accuracy. We also study how context can be stored in LLM's weights effectively and efficiently. Through a detailed ablation study, we examine which Transformer modules are most beneficial to fine-tune at test-time. Interestingly, we find that fine-tuning the second layer of the FFNs is more effective than full fine-tuning, leading to a further improvement in the models' accuracy.

      Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly used to build agents in social simulation because of their impressive abilities to generate fluent, contextually coherent dialogues. Such abilities can enhance the realism of models. However, the pursuit of realism is not necessarily compatible with the epistemic foundation of modelling. We argue that LLM agents, in many regards, are too human to model: they are too expressive, detailed and intractable to be consistent with the abstraction, simplification, and interpretability typically demanded by modelling. Through a model-building thought experiment that converts the Bass diffusion model to an LLM-based variant, we uncover five core dilemmas: a temporal resolution mismatch between natural conversation and abstract time steps; the need for intervention in conversations while avoiding undermining spontaneous agent outputs; the temptation to introduce rule-like instructions in prompts while maintaining conversational naturalness; the tension between role consistency and role evolution across time; and the challenge of understanding emergence, where system-level patterns become obscured by verbose micro textual outputs. These dilemmas steer the LLM agents towards an uncanny valley: not abstract enough to clarify underlying social mechanisms, while not natural enough to represent realistic human behaviour. This exposes an important paradox: the realism of LLM agents can obscure, rather than clarify, social dynamics when misapplied. We tease out the conditions in which LLM agents are ideally suited: where system-level emergence is not the focus, linguistic nuances and meaning are central, interactions unfold in natural time, and stable role identity is more important than long-term behavioural evolution. We call for repositioning LLM agents in the ecosystem of social simulation for future applications.

      Watermarking is a promising defense against the misuse of large language models (LLMs), yet it remains vulnerable to scrubbing and spoofing attacks. This vulnerability stems from an inherent trade-off governed by watermark window size: smaller windows resist scrubbing better but are easier to reverse-engineer, enabling low-cost statistics-based spoofing attacks. This work breaks this trade-off by introducing a novel mechanism, equivalent texture keys, where multiple tokens within a watermark window can independently support the detection. Based on the redundancy, we propose a novel watermark scheme with Sub-vocabulary decomposed Equivalent tExture Key (SEEK). It achieves a Pareto improvement, increasing the resilience against scrubbing attacks without compromising robustness to spoofing. Experiments demonstrate SEEK's superiority over prior method, yielding spoofing robustness gains of +88.2%/+92.3%/+82.0% and scrubbing robustness gains of +10.2%/+6.4%/+24.6% across diverse dataset settings.

      Semantic caching enhances the efficiency of large language model (LLM) systems by identifying semantically similar queries, storing responses once, and serving them for subsequent equivalent requests. However, existing semantic caching frameworks rely on single embedding models for query representation, which limits their ability to capture the diverse semantic relationships present in real-world query distributions. This paper presents an ensemble embedding approach that combines multiple embedding models through a trained meta-encoder to improve semantic similarity detection in LLM caching systems. We evaluate our method using the Quora Question Pairs (QQP) dataset, measuring cache hit ratios, cache miss ratios, token savings, and response times. Our ensemble approach achieves a 92\% cache hit ratio for semantically equivalent queries while maintaining an 85\% accuracy in correctly rejecting non-equivalent queries as cache misses. These results demonstrate that ensemble embedding methods significantly outperform single-model approaches in distinguishing between semantically similar and dissimilar queries, leading to more effective caching performance and reduced computational overhead in LLM-based systems.

      Recent studies have revealed a consistent liberal orientation in the ethical and political responses generated by most commercial large language models (LLMs), yet the underlying causes and resulting implications remain unclear. This paper systematically investigates the political temperament of seven prominent LLMs - OpenAI's GPT-4o, Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4, Perplexity (Sonar Large), Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash, Meta AI's Llama 4, Mistral 7b Le Chat and High-Flyer's DeepSeek R1 -- using a multi-pronged approach that includes Moral Foundations Theory, a dozen established political ideology scales and a new index of current political controversies. We find strong and consistent prioritization of liberal-leaning values, particularly care and fairness, across most models. Further analysis attributes this trend to four overlapping factors: Liberal-leaning training corpora, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), the dominance of liberal frameworks in academic ethical discourse and safety-driven fine-tuning practices. We also distinguish between political "bias" and legitimate epistemic differences, cautioning against conflating the two. A comparison of base and fine-tuned model pairs reveals that fine-tuning generally increases liberal lean, an effect confirmed through both self-report and empirical testing. We argue that this "liberal tilt" is not a programming error or the personal preference of programmers but an emergent property of training on democratic rights-focused discourse. Finally, we propose that LLMs may indirectly echo John Rawls' famous veil-of ignorance philosophical aspiration, reflecting a moral stance unanchored to personal identity or interest. Rather than undermining democratic discourse, this pattern may offer a new lens through which to examine collective reasoning.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been applied to reranking tasks in information retrieval, achieving strong performance. However, their high computational demands often hinder practical deployment. Existing studies evaluate the efficiency of LLM-based rerankers using proxy metrics such as latency, the number of forward passes, input tokens, and output tokens. However, these metrics depend on hardware and running-time choices (\eg parallel or not, batch size, etc), and often fail to account for model size, making it difficult to interpret and obscuring the evaluation of the efficiency-effectiveness tradeoff. To address this issue, we propose E\textsuperscript{2}R-FLOPs, for LLM-based rerankers: ranking metrics per PetaFLOP (RPP) for relevance per compute and queries per PetaFLOP (QPP) for hardware-agnostic throughput. Companied with the new metrics, an interpretable FLOPs estimator is built to estimate the FLOPs of an LLM-based reranker even without running any experiments. Based on the proposed metrics, we conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate a wide range of LLM-based rerankers with different architecture, studying the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off and bringing this issue to the attention of the research community.

More importantly, this new design perspective enables us to efficiently collect enormous high-quality data and reasoning traces with E-graph, which further results in an effective fine-tuning of LLM. Experimental results show that PrefixAgent synthesizes prefix adders with consistently smaller areas compared to baseline methods, while maintaining scalability and generalization in commercial EDA flows.

      Information removal or suppression in large language models (LLMs) is a desired functionality, useful in AI regulation, legal compliance, safety, and privacy. LLM unlearning methods aim to remove information on demand from LLMs. Current LLM unlearning methods struggle to balance the unlearning efficacy and utility due to the competing nature of these objectives. Keeping the unlearning process computationally feasible without assuming access to the model weights is an overlooked area. In this work we show that \textit{agents might be all we need for effective and practical inference-time LLM unlearning}. We present the first agentic LLM unlearning (\texttt{ALU}) method, a multi-agent, retrain-free, model-agnostic approach to LLM unlearning that achieves effective unlearning while preserving the utility. Our \texttt{ALU} framework unlearns by involving multiple LLM agents, each designed for a specific step in the unlearning process, without the need to update model weights for any of the agents in the framework. Users can easily request any set of unlearning instances in any sequence, and \texttt{ALU} seamlessly adapts in real time. This is facilitated without requiring any changes in the underlying LLM model. Through extensive experiments on established benchmarks (TOFU, WMDP, WPU) and jailbreaking techniques (many shot, target masking, other languages), we demonstrate that \texttt{ALU} consistently stands out as the most robust inference-time LLM unlearning framework among current state-of-the-art methods while incurring time cost that remains effectively constant regardless of the number of unlearning targets. We further highlight \texttt{ALU}'s superior performance compared to existing methods when evaluated at scale. Specifically, \texttt{ALU} is assessed on up to 1000 unlearning targets, exceeding the evaluation scope of all previously proposed LLM unlearning methods.

To address these limitations, we propose using future event prediction as a continuous evaluation method to assess LLMs' temporal generalization and forecasting abilities. Our benchmark, Daily Oracle, automatically generates question-answer (QA) pairs from daily news, challenging LLMs to predict "future" event outcomes.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to memorize portions of their training data, sometimes reproducing content verbatim when prompted appropriately. In this work, we investigate a fundamental yet under-explored question in the domain of memorization: How to characterize memorization difficulty of training data in LLMs? Through empirical experiments on OLMo, a family of open models, we present the Entropy-Memorization Law. It suggests that data entropy is linearly correlated with memorization score. Moreover, in a case study of memorizing highly randomized strings, or "gibberish", we observe that such sequences, despite their apparent randomness, exhibit unexpectedly low empirical entropy compared to the broader training corpus. Adopting the same strategy to discover Entropy-Memorization Law, we derive a simple yet effective approach to distinguish training and testing data, enabling Dataset Inference (DI).

      In this work, we propose a novel framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with an RL-based dialogue manager for open-ended dialogue with a specific goal. By leveraging hierarchical reinforcement learning to model the structured phases of dialogue and employ meta-learning to enhance adaptability across diverse user profiles, our approach enhances adaptability and efficiency, enabling the system to learn from limited data, transition fluidly between dialogue phases, and personalize responses to heterogeneous patient needs. We apply our framework to Motivational Interviews, aiming to foster behavior change, and demonstrate that the proposed dialogue manager outperforms a state-of-the-art LLM baseline in terms of reward, showing a potential benefit of conditioning LLMs to create open-ended dialogue systems with specific goals.

      Security alignment enables the Large Language Model (LLM) to gain the protection against malicious queries, but various jailbreak attack methods reveal the vulnerability of this security mechanism. Previous studies have isolated LLM jailbreak attacks and defenses. We analyze the security protection mechanism of the LLM, and propose a framework that combines attack and defense. Our method is based on the linearly separable property of LLM intermediate layer embedding, as well as the essence of jailbreak attack, which aims to embed harmful problems and transfer them to the safe area. We utilize generative adversarial network (GAN) to learn the security judgment boundary inside the LLM to achieve efficient jailbreak attack and defense. The experimental results indicate that our method achieves an average jailbreak success rate of 88.85\% across three popular LLMs, while the defense success rate on the state-of-the-art jailbreak dataset reaches an average of 84.17\%. This not only validates the effectiveness of our approach but also sheds light on the internal security mechanisms of LLMs, offering new insights for enhancing model security The code and data are available at https://github.com/NLPGM/CAVGAN.

In a within-subject study, 132 adults in the United Kingdom and China completed both self-administered and chatbot versions. Scores demonstrated strong agreement (ICC = 0.91; 45% identical). Among 75 participants providing comparative feedback, 71% reported greater trust in the chatbot, highlighting clearer structure, interpretive guidance, and a supportive tone. Mean ratings (0-10) were 8.4 for comfort, 7.7 for voice clarity, 7.6 for handling sensitive topics, and 7.4 for recommendation helpfulness; the latter varied significantly by employment status and prior mental-health service use (p < 0.05). Overall, 87.1% expressed willingness to reuse or recommend HopeBot.

      There is growing excitement about building software verifiers, synthesizers, and other Automated Reasoning (AR) tools by combining traditional symbolic algorithms and Large Language Models (LLMs). Unfortunately, the current practice for constructing such neurosymbolic AR systems is an ad hoc programming model that does not have the strong guarantees of traditional symbolic algorithms, nor a deep enough synchronization of neural networks and symbolic reasoning to unlock the full potential of LLM-powered reasoning. I propose Neurosymbolic Transition Systems as a principled computational model that can underlie infrastructure for building neurosymbolic AR tools. In this model, symbolic state is paired with intuition, and state transitions operate over symbols and intuition in parallel. I argue why this new paradigm can scale logical reasoning beyond current capabilities while retaining the strong guarantees of symbolic algorithms, and I sketch out how the computational model I propose can be reified in a logic programming language.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      A recent Large language model (LLM)-based recommendation model, called RecRanker, has demonstrated a superior performance in the top-k recommendation task compared to other models. In particular, RecRanker samples users via clustering, generates an initial ranking list using an initial recommendation model, and fine-tunes an LLM through hybrid instruction tuning to infer user preferences. However, the contribution of each core component remains underexplored. In this work, we inspect the reproducibility of RecRanker, and study the impact and role of its various components. We begin by reproducing the RecRanker pipeline through the implementation of all its key components. Our reproduction shows that the pairwise and listwise methods achieve a performance comparable to that reported in the original paper. For the pointwise method, while we are also able to reproduce the original paper's results, further analysis shows that the performance is abnormally high due to data leakage from the inclusion of ground-truth information in the prompts. To enable a fair and comprehensive evaluation of LLM-based top-k recommendations, we propose RecRankerEval, an extensible framework that covers five key dimensions: user sampling strategy, initial recommendation model, LLM backbone, dataset selection, and instruction tuning method. Using the RecRankerEval framework, we show that the original results of RecRanker can be reproduced on the ML-100K and ML-1M datasets, as well as the additional Amazon-Music dataset, but not on BookCrossing due to the lack of timestamp information in the original RecRanker paper. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RecRanker's performance can be improved by employing alternative user sampling methods, stronger initial recommenders, and more capable LLMs.

      LLM-as-a-Judge models generate chain-of-thought (CoT) sequences intended to capture the step-bystep reasoning process that underlies the final evaluation of a response. However, due to the lack of human annotated CoTs for evaluation, the required components and structure of effective reasoning traces remain understudied. Consequently, previous approaches often (1) constrain reasoning traces to hand-designed components, such as a list of criteria, reference answers, or verification questions and (2) structure them such that planning is intertwined with the reasoning for evaluation. In this work, we propose EvalPlanner, a preference optimization algorithm for Thinking-LLM-as-a-Judge that first generates an unconstrained evaluation plan, followed by its execution, and then the final judgment. In a self-training loop, EvalPlanner iteratively optimizes over synthetically constructed evaluation plans and executions, leading to better final verdicts. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art performance for generative reward models on RewardBench (with a score of 93.9), despite being trained on fewer amount of, and synthetically generated, preference pairs. Additional experiments on other benchmarks like RM-Bench, JudgeBench, and FollowBenchEval further highlight the utility of both planning and reasoning for building robust LLM-as-a-Judge reasoning models.

      Current video understanding models excel at recognizing "what" is happening but fall short in high-level cognitive tasks like causal reasoning and future prediction, a limitation rooted in their lack of commonsense world knowledge. To bridge this cognitive gap, we propose a novel framework that synergistically fuses a powerful Vision Foundation Model (VFM) for deep visual perception with a Large Language Model (LLM) serving as a knowledge-driven reasoning core. Our key technical innovation is a sophisticated fusion module, inspired by the Q-Former architecture, which distills complex spatiotemporal and object-centric visual features into a concise, language-aligned representation. This enables the LLM to effectively ground its inferential processes in direct visual evidence. The model is trained via a two-stage strategy, beginning with large-scale alignment pre-training on video-text data, followed by targeted instruction fine-tuning on a curated dataset designed to elicit advanced reasoning and prediction skills. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging benchmarks. Notably, it exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen reasoning tasks, and our in-depth ablation studies validate the critical contribution of each architectural component. This work pushes the boundary of machine perception from simple recognition towards genuine cognitive understanding, paving the way for more intelligent and capable AI systems in robotics, human-computer interaction, and beyond.

      Creating a cast of characters by attending to their relational dynamics is a critical aspect of most long-form storywriting. However, our formative study (N=14) reveals that writers struggle to envision new characters that could influence existing ones, to balance similarities and differences among characters, and to intricately flesh out their relationships. Based on these observations, we designed Constella, an LLM-based multi-agent tool that supports storywriters' interconnected character creation process. Constella suggests related characters (FRIENDS DISCOVERY feature), reveals the inner mindscapes of several characters simultaneously (JOURNALS feature), and manifests relationships through inter-character responses (COMMENTS feature). Our 7-8 day deployment study with storywriters (N=11) shows that Constella enabled the creation of expansive communities composed of related characters, facilitated the comparison of characters' thoughts and emotions, and deepened writers' understanding of character relationships. We conclude by discussing how multi-agent interactions can help distribute writers' attention and effort across the character cast.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Despite the remarkable progress of large language models (LLMs) across various domains, their capacity to predict retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) risk remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a novel Chinese benchmark dataset, termed CROP, comprising 993 admission records annotated with low, medium, and high-risk labels. To systematically examine the predictive capabilities and affective biases of LLMs in ROP risk stratification, we propose Affective-ROPTester, an automated evaluation framework incorporating three prompting strategies: Instruction-based, Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and In-Context Learning (ICL). The Instruction scheme assesses LLMs' intrinsic knowledge and associated biases, whereas the CoT and ICL schemes leverage external medical knowledge to enhance predictive accuracy. Crucially, we integrate emotional elements at the prompt level to investigate how different affective framings influence the model's ability to predict ROP and its bias patterns. Empirical results derived from the CROP dataset yield two principal observations. First, LLMs demonstrate limited efficacy in ROP risk prediction when operating solely on intrinsic knowledge, yet exhibit marked performance gains when augmented with structured external inputs. Second, affective biases are evident in the model outputs, with a consistent inclination toward overestimating medium- and high-risk cases. Third, compared to negative emotions, positive emotional framing contributes to mitigating predictive bias in model outputs. These findings highlight the critical role of affect-sensitive prompt engineering in enhancing diagnostic reliability and emphasize the utility of Affective-ROPTester as a framework for evaluating and mitigating affective bias in clinical language modeling systems.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in multi-turn conversational tasks, yet their pre-training data predominantly consists of continuous prose, creating a potential mismatch between required capabilities and training paradigms. We introduce a novel approach to address this discrepancy by synthesizing conversational data from existing text corpora. We present a pipeline that transforms a cluster of multiple related documents into an extended multi-turn, multi-topic information-seeking dialogue. Applying our pipeline to Wikipedia articles, we curate DocTalk, a multi-turn pre-training dialogue corpus consisting of over 730k long conversations. We hypothesize that exposure to such synthesized conversational structures during pre-training can enhance the fundamental multi-turn capabilities of LLMs, such as context memory and understanding. Empirically, we show that incorporating DocTalk during pre-training results in up to 40% gain in context memory and understanding, without compromising base performance.

      Large language models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination stemming from misaligned self-awareness, particularly when processing queries exceeding their knowledge boundaries. While existing mitigation strategies employ uncertainty estimation or query rejection mechanisms, they suffer from computational efficiency and sacrificed helpfulness. To address these issues, we propose the Explicit Knowledge Boundary Modeling (EKBM) framework, integrating fast and slow reasoning systems to harmonize reliability and usability. The framework first employs a fast-thinking model to generate confidence-labeled responses, enabling immediate utilization of high-confidence outputs, whereas uncertain predictions trigger a slow refinement model for accuracy improvement. To align model behavior with our proposed object, we propose a hybrid training pipeline, enhancing self-awareness without degrading task performance. Evaluations on dialogue state tracking tasks demonstrate that EKBM achieves superior model reliability over uncertainty-based baselines. Further analysis reveals that refinement substantially boosts accuracy while maintaining low computational overhead. The framework establishes a scalable paradigm for deploying reliable LLMs in error-sensitive applications, effectively balancing accuracy and practical utility.

However, as these models become increasingly integrated into societal frameworks, the imperative to ensure they operate within ethical and moral boundaries has never been more critical. This paper introduces a novel benchmark designed to measure and compare the moral reasoning capabilities of LLMs. We present the first comprehensive dataset specifically curated to probe the moral dimensions of LLM outputs, addressing a wide range of ethical dilemmas and scenarios reflective of real-world complexities. The main contribution of this work lies in the development of benchmark datasets and metrics for assessing the moral identity of LLMs, which accounts for nuance, contextual sensitivity, and alignment with human ethical standards. Our methodology involves a multi-faceted approach, combining quantitative analysis with qualitative insights from ethics scholars to ensure a thorough evaluation of model performance. By applying our benchmark across several leading LLMs, we uncover significant variations in moral reasoning capabilities of different models.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in domains such as mathematics and programming, yet their capabilities in physics remain underexplored and poorly understood. Physics poses unique challenges that demand not only precise computation but also deep conceptual understanding and physical modeling skills. Existing benchmarks often fall short due to limited difficulty, multiple-choice formats, and static evaluation settings that fail to capture physical modeling ability. In this paper, we introduce ABench-Physics, a novel benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate LLMs' physical reasoning and generalization capabilities. ABench-Physics consists of two components: Phy_A, a static set of 400 graduate- or Olympiad-level problems; and Phy_B, a dynamic subset of 100 problems equipped with an automatic variation engine to test model robustness across changing conditions. All questions require precise numerical answers, with strict formatting and tolerance constraints. Our evaluation of several state-of-the-art LLMs reveals substantial performance gaps, highlighting persistent limitations in physical reasoning, especially in generalization to dynamic variants. ABench-Physics provides a challenging and diagnostic framework for advancing scientific reasoning in LLMs.

      Multi-source Opinion Summarization (M-OS) extends beyond traditional opinion summarization by incorporating additional sources of product metadata such as descriptions, key features, specifications, and ratings, alongside reviews. This integration results in comprehensive summaries that capture both subjective opinions and objective product attributes essential for informed decision-making. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant success in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, their potential in M-OS remains largely unexplored. Additionally, the lack of evaluation datasets for this task has impeded further advancements. To bridge this gap, we introduce M-OS-EVAL, a benchmark dataset for evaluating multi-source opinion summaries across 7 key dimensions: fluency, coherence, relevance, faithfulness, aspect coverage, sentiment consistency, specificity. Our results demonstrate that M-OS significantly enhances user engagement, as evidenced by a user study in which, on average, 87% of participants preferred M-OS over opinion summaries. Our experiments demonstrate that factually enriched summaries enhance user engagement. Notably, M-OS-PROMPTS exhibit stronger alignment with human judgment, achieving an average Spearman correlation of \r{ho} = 0.74, which surpasses the performance of previous methodologies.

      Question-answering (QA) interfaces powered by large language models (LLMs) present a promising direction for improving interactivity with HVAC system insights, particularly for non-expert users. However, enabling accurate, real-time, and context-aware interactions with HVAC systems introduces unique challenges, including the integration of frequently updated sensor data, domain-specific knowledge grounding, and coherent multi-stage reasoning. In this paper, we present JARVIS, a two-stage LLM-based QA framework tailored for sensor data-driven HVAC system interaction. JARVIS employs an Expert-LLM to translate high-level user queries into structured execution instructions, and an Agent that performs SQL-based data retrieval, statistical processing, and final response generation. To address HVAC-specific challenges, JARVIS integrates (1) an adaptive context injection strategy for efficient HVAC and deployment-specific information integration, (2) a parameterized SQL builder and executor to improve data access reliability, and (3) a bottom-up planning scheme to ensure consistency across multi-stage response generation. We evaluate JARVIS using real-world data collected from a commercial HVAC system and a ground truth QA dataset curated by HVAC experts to demonstrate its effectiveness in delivering accurate and interpretable responses across diverse queries. Results show that JARVIS consistently outperforms baseline and ablation variants in both automated and user-centered assessments, achieving high response quality and accuracy.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant potential for automating Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code generation. However, current approaches face a critical challenge: they can not simultaneously optimize for functional correctness and hardware quality (Power, Performance, Area - PPA). Methods based on supervised fine-tuning often generate functionally correct but PPA-suboptimal code, lacking mechanisms to learn optimization principles. In contrast, post-processing techniques that attempt to improve PPA metrics after generation are often inefficient because they operate externally without updating the LLM's parameters, thus failing to enhance the model's intrinsic design capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce ChipSeek-R1, a hierarchical reward-driven reinforcement learning framework to train LLMs to generate RTL code that achieves both functional correctness and optimized PPA metrics. ChipSeek-R1 employs a hierarchical reward system, which incorporates direct feedback on syntax, functional correctness (from simulators) and PPA metrics (from synthesis tools) during reinforcement learning. This enables the model to learn complex hardware design trade-offs via trial-and-error, generating RTL code that is both functionally correct and PPA-optimized. Evaluating ChipSeek-R1 on standard benchmarks (VerilogEval, RTLLM), we achieve state-of-the-art results in functional correctness. Notably, on the RTLLM benchmark, ChipSeek-R1 generated 27 RTL designs surpassing the PPA metrics of the original human-written code. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating toolchain feedback into LLM training and highlight the potential for reinforcement learning to enable automated generation of human-surpassing RTL code. We open-source our code in anonymous github.

      Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant success in visual understanding tasks. However, challenges persist in adapting these models for video comprehension due to the large volume of data and temporal complexity. Existing Video-LLMs using uniform frame sampling often struggle to capture the query-related crucial spatiotemporal clues of videos effectively. In this paper, we introduce Q-Frame, a novel approach for adaptive frame selection and multi-resolution scaling tailored to the video's content and the specific query. Q-Frame employs a training-free, plug-and-play strategy generated by a text-image matching network like CLIP, utilizing the Gumbel-Max trick for efficient frame selection. Q-Frame allows Video-LLMs to process more frames without exceeding computational limits, thereby preserving critical temporal and spatial information. We demonstrate Q-Frame's effectiveness through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including MLVU, LongVideoBench, and Video-MME, illustrating its superiority over existing methods and its applicability across various video understanding tasks.

      Multi-agent systems powered by Large Language Models (LLM-MAS) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in collaborative problem-solving. While LLM-MAS exhibit strong collaborative abilities, the security risks in their communication and coordination remain underexplored. We bridge this gap by systematically investigating intention-hiding threats in LLM-MAS, and design four representative attack paradigms that subtly disrupt task completion while maintaining high concealment. These attacks are evaluated in centralized, decentralized, and layered communication structures. Experiments conducted on six benchmark datasets, including MMLU, MMLU-Pro, HumanEval, GSM8K, arithmetic, and biographies, demonstrate that they exhibit strong disruptive capabilities. To identify these threats, we propose a psychology-based detection framework AgentXposed, which combines the HEXACO personality model with the Reid Technique, using progressive questionnaire inquiries and behavior-based monitoring. Experiments conducted on six types of attacks show that our detection framework effectively identifies all types of malicious behaviors. The detection rate for our intention-hiding attacks is slightly lower than that of the two baselines, Incorrect Fact Injection and Dark Traits Injection, demonstrating the effectiveness of intention concealment. Our findings reveal the structural and behavioral risks posed by intention-hiding attacks and offer valuable insights into securing LLM-based multi-agent systems through psychological perspectives, which contributes to a deeper understanding of multi-agent safety.

      LLMs are increasingly used to design reward functions based on human preferences in Reinforcement Learning (RL). We focus on LLM-designed rewards for Restless Multi-Armed Bandits, a framework for allocating limited resources among agents. In applications such as public health, this approach empowers grassroots health workers to tailor automated allocation decisions to community needs. In the presence of multiple agents, altering the reward function based on human preferences can impact subpopulations very differently, leading to complex tradeoffs and a multi-objective resource allocation problem. We are the first to present a principled method termed Social Choice Language Model for dealing with these tradeoffs for LLM-designed rewards for multiagent planners in general and restless bandits in particular. The novel part of our model is a transparent and configurable selection component, called an adjudicator, external to the LLM that controls complex tradeoffs via a user-selected social welfare function. Our experiments demonstrate that our model reliably selects more effective, aligned, and balanced reward functions compared to purely LLM-based approaches.

      How to generate a large, realistic set of tables along with joinability relationships, to stress-test dataset discovery methods? Dataset discovery methods aim to automatically identify related data assets in a data lake. The development and evaluation of such solutions for customers from a wide range of business domains, relies on diverse, high quality and domain-specific tabular benchmarks. Large language models (LLMs) are trained on a wide variety of text data, which can provide a strong foundation of general and domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, we ask the question -- \textit{can we leverage LLMs to generate a tabular benchmark adequate for evaluating the dataset discovery solutions?} In particular, we focus on the task of finding joinable tables which is the cornerstone of virtually every dataset discovery method. Current corpora for evaluating dataset discovery methods are mainly based on subsets of open data, and they suffer from three important issues: $i)$ they focus on very common and generic data types (e.g., address, id, name, etc.); $ii)$ they do not contain human-annotated column pairs; instead, practitioners synthesize ground truth using table splits (e.g., horizontal for table union search and vertical ones for joinability) and $iii)$ they do not focus on semantic column relationships.

      Automatically extracting vectorized building contours from remote sensing imagery is crucial for urban planning, population estimation, and disaster assessment. Current state-of-the-art methods rely on complex multi-stage pipelines involving pixel segmentation, vectorization, and polygon refinement, which limits their scalability and real-world applicability. Inspired by the remarkable reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce VectorLLM, the first Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) designed for regular building contour extraction from remote sensing images. Unlike existing approaches, VectorLLM performs corner-point by corner-point regression of building contours directly, mimicking human annotators' labeling process. Our architecture consists of a vision foundation backbone, an MLP connector, and an LLM, enhanced with learnable position embeddings to improve spatial understanding capability. Through comprehensive exploration of training strategies including pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and preference optimization across WHU, WHU-Mix, and CrowdAI datasets, VectorLLM significantly outperformed the previous SOTA methods by 5.6 AP, 7.1 AP, 13.6 AP, respectively in the three datasets. Remarkably, VectorLLM exhibits strong zero-shot performance on unseen objects including aircraft, water bodies, and oil tanks, highlighting its potential for unified modeling of diverse remote sensing object contour extraction tasks. Overall, this work establishes a new paradigm for vector extraction in remote sensing, leveraging the topological reasoning capabilities of LLMs to achieve both high accuracy and exceptional generalization.

      Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for recommendation has demonstrated notable success in various domains, showcasing their potential for open-domain recommendation. A key challenge to advancing open-domain recommendation lies in effectively modeling user preferences from users' heterogeneous behaviors across multiple domains. Existing approaches, including ID-based and semantic-based modeling, struggle with poor generalization, an inability to compress noisy interactions effectively, and the domain seesaw phenomenon. To address these challenges, we propose a Heterogeneous User Modeling (HUM) method, which incorporates a compression enhancer and a robustness enhancer for LLM-based recommendation. The compression enhancer uses a customized prompt to compress heterogeneous behaviors into a tailored token, while a masking mechanism enhances cross-domain knowledge extraction and understanding. The robustness enhancer introduces a domain importance score to mitigate the domain seesaw phenomenon by guiding domain optimization. Extensive experiments on heterogeneous datasets validate that HUM effectively models user heterogeneity by achieving both high efficacy and robustness, leading to superior performance in open-domain recommendation.

      Text embeddings from large language models (LLMs) have achieved excellent results in tasks such as information retrieval, semantic textual similarity, etc. In this work, we show an interesting finding: when feeding a text into the LLM-based embedder, the obtained text embedding will be able to be aligned with the key tokens in the input text. We first fully analyze this phenomenon on eight LLM-based embedders and show that this phenomenon is universal and is not affected by model architecture, training strategy, and embedding method. With a deeper analysis, we find that the main change in embedding space between these embedders and their LLM backbones is in the first principal component. By adjusting the first principal component, we can align text embedding with the key tokens. Finally, we give several examples to demonstrate the vast application potential of this finding: (1) we propose a simple and practical sparse retrieval method based on the aligned tokens, which can achieve 80% of the dense retrieval effect of the same model while reducing the computation significantly; (2) we show that our findings provide a novel perspective to help understand novel technologies (e.g., instruction-following embedding) and fuzzy concepts (e.g., semantic relatedness vs. similarity) in this field.

      Session-based Recommendation (SBR) aims to predict the next item a user will likely engage with, using their interaction sequence within an anonymous session. Existing SBR models often focus only on single-session information, ignoring inter-session relationships and valuable cross-session insights. Some methods try to include inter-session data but struggle with noise and irrelevant information, reducing performance. Additionally, most models rely on item ID co-occurrence and overlook rich semantic details, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained item features. To address these challenges, we propose a novel hierarchical intent-guided optimization approach with pluggable LLM-driven semantic learning for session-based recommendations, called HIPHOP. First, we introduce a pluggable embedding module based on large language models (LLMs) to generate high-quality semantic representations, enhancing item embeddings. Second, HIPHOP utilizes graph neural networks (GNNs) to model item transition relationships and incorporates a dynamic multi-intent capturing module to address users' diverse interests within a session. Additionally, we design a hierarchical inter-session similarity learning module, guided by user intent, to capture global and local session relationships, effectively exploring users' long-term and short-term interests. To mitigate noise, an intent-guided denoising strategy is applied during inter-session learning. Finally, we enhance the model's discriminative capability by using contrastive learning to optimize session representations. Experiments on multiple datasets show that HIPHOP significantly outperforms existing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving recommendation quality.

      Navigating everyday social situations often requires juggling conflicting goals, such as conveying a harsh truth, maintaining trust, all while still being mindful of another person's feelings. These value trade-offs are an integral part of human decision-making and language use, however, current tools for interpreting such dynamic and multi-faceted notions of values in LLMs are limited. In cognitive science, so-called "cognitive models" provide formal accounts of these trade-offs in humans, by modeling the weighting of a speaker's competing utility functions in choosing an action or utterance. In this work, we use a leading cognitive model of polite speech to interpret the extent to which LLMs represent human-like trade-offs. We apply this lens to systematically evaluate value trade-offs in two encompassing model settings: degrees of reasoning "effort" in frontier black-box models, and RL post-training dynamics of open-source models. Our results highlight patterns of higher informational utility than social utility in reasoning models, and in open-source models shown to be stronger in mathematical reasoning. Our findings from LLMs' training dynamics suggest large shifts in utility values early on in training with persistent effects of the choice of base model and pretraining data, compared to feedback dataset or alignment method. We show that our method is responsive to diverse aspects of the rapidly evolving LLM landscape, with insights for forming hypotheses about other high-level behaviors, shaping training regimes for reasoning models, and better controlling trade-offs between values during model training.

      Normative requirements specify social, legal, ethical, empathetic, and cultural (SLEEC) norms that must be observed by a system. To support the identification of SLEEC requirements, numerous standards and regulations have been developed. These requirements are typically defined by stakeholders in the non-technical system with diverse expertise (e.g., ethicists, lawyers, social scientists). Hence, ensuring their consistency and managing the requirement elicitation process are complex and error-prone tasks. Recent research has addressed this challenge using domain-specific languages to specify normative requirements as rules, whose consistency can then be analyzed with formal methods. Nevertheless, these approaches often present the results from formal verification tools in a way that is inaccessible to non-technical users. This hinders understanding and makes the iterative process of eliciting and validating these requirements inefficient in terms of both time and effort. To address this problem, we introduce SLEEC-LLM, a tool that uses large language models (LLMs) to provide natural-language interpretations for model-checking counterexamples corresponding to SLEEC rule inconsistencies. SLEEC-LLM improves the efficiency and explainability of normative requirements elicitation and consistency analysis. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we summarise its use in two real-world case studies involving non-technical stakeholders.

      The ubiquitous presence of smartphones and wearables has enabled researchers to build prediction and detection models for various health and behavior outcomes using passive sensing data from these devices. Achieving a high-level, holistic understanding of an individual's behavior and context, however, remains a significant challenge. Due to the nature of passive sensing data, sensemaking -- the process of interpreting and extracting insights -- requires both domain knowledge and technical expertise, creating barriers for different stakeholders. Existing systems designed to support sensemaking are either not open-ended or cannot perform complex data triangulation. In this paper, we present a novel sensemaking system, Group of LLMs for Open-ended Sensemaking (GLOSS), capable of open-ended sensemaking and performing complex multimodal triangulation to derive insights.

      Hierarchical control for robotics has long been plagued by the need to have a well defined interface layer to communicate between high-level task planners and low-level policies. With the advent of LLMs, language has been emerging as a prospective interface layer. However, this has several limitations. Not all tasks can be decomposed into steps that are easily expressible in natural language (e.g. performing a dance routine). Further, it makes end-to-end finetuning on embodied data challenging due to domain shift and catastrophic forgetting. We introduce our method -- Learnable Latent Codes as Bridges (LCB) -- as an alternate architecture to overcome these limitations. \method~uses a learnable latent code to act as a bridge between LLMs and low-level policies. This enables LLMs to flexibly communicate goals in the task plan without being entirely constrained by language limitations. Additionally, it enables end-to-end finetuning without destroying the embedding space of word tokens learned during pre-training. Through experiments on Language Table and Calvin, two common language based benchmarks for embodied agents, we find that \method~outperforms baselines (including those w/ GPT-4V) that leverage pure language as the interface layer on tasks that require reasoning and multi-step behaviors.

      Large language models (LLMs) can store a massive amount of knowledge, yet their potential to acquire new knowledge remains unknown. We propose a novel evaluation framework that evaluates this capability. This framework prompts LLMs to generate questions about a statement introducing scientific knowledge, simulating a curious person when facing the statement for the first time. We score the qualities of the generated questions, thereby evaluating the knowledge acquisition potential of the LLM. We apply controlled ablation studies to validate our scoring procedures. Additionally, we created a synthetic dataset consisting of 1101 statements in physics, chemistry, and maths with distinct levels of difficulties, 300 general knowledge statements, and 567 incorrect statements. Human evaluations were conducted to validate our model assessments, achieving an approximate weighted Cohen's kappa of 0.7 on all three metrics considered. We find that while large models like GPT-4 and Mistral 8x7b are adept at generating coherent and relevant questions, the smaller Phi-2 model is equally or more effective. This indicates that size does not solely determine a model's knowledge acquisition potential. The proposed framework quantifies a critical model capability that was commonly overlooked and opens up research opportunities for developing more knowledgeable AI systems

      Large language models (LLMs) can generate code from natural language descriptions. Their performance is typically evaluated using programming benchmarks that simulate real-world tasks. These benchmarks provide specifications in the form of docstrings, function signatures, or bug reports. The model then generates a program, which is tested against predefined test cases. In contrast, Programming by Example (PBE) uses input-output examples as the specification. Traditional PBE systems rely on search-based methods over restricted transformation spaces. They are usually designed for narrow domains and fixed input formats. It remains unclear how well LLMs perform on PBE tasks. In this work, we evaluate LLMs on PBE tasks involving tabular data transformations. We prompt models to generate functions that convert an input table to an output table. We test the generated functions on unseen inputs to measure accuracy. Our study includes multiple LLMs and evaluates different prompting strategies, such as one-shot vs. multi-try. We also compare performance with and without PBE-specific knowledge. Finally, we propose a hybrid method that calls a traditional PBE solver first, and then falls back to LLMs if necessary. Our results show that LLMs support more diverse input formats and achieve higher accuracy than conventional methods. However, they struggle with tasks that contain ambiguity. The hybrid approach improves overall success by combining the strengths of both approaches.

      Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled new applications in e-commerce customer service. However, their capabilities remain constrained in complex, multimodal scenarios. We present MindFlow, the first open-source multimodal LLM agent tailored for e-commerce. Built on the CoALA framework, it integrates memory, decision-making, and action modules, and adopts a modular "MLLM-as-Tool" strategy for effect visual-textual reasoning. Evaluated via online A/B testing and simulation-based ablation, MindFlow demonstrates substantial gains in handling complex queries, improving user satisfaction, and reducing operational costs, with a 93.53% relative improvement observed in real-world deployments.
