      Accelerating large language model (LLM) inference is critical for real-world deployments requiring high throughput and low latency. Contextual sparsity, where each token dynamically activates only a small subset of the model parameters, shows promise but does not scale to large batch sizes due to union of active neurons quickly approaching dense computation. We introduce Polar Sparsity, highlighting a key shift in sparsity importance from MLP to Attention layers as we scale batch size and sequence length. While MLP layers become more compute-efficient under batching, their sparsity vanishes. In contrast, attention becomes increasingly more expensive at scale, while their head sparsity remains stable and batch-invariant. We develop hardware-efficient, sparsity-aware GPU kernels for selective MLP and Attention computations, delivering up to \(2.2\times\) end-to-end speedups for models like OPT, LLaMA-2 \& 3, across various batch sizes and sequence lengths without compromising accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate that contextual sparsity can scale effectively to large batch sizes, delivering substantial inference acceleration with minimal changes, making Polar Sparsity practical for large-scale, high-throughput LLM deployment systems.

      This paper presents a systematic evaluation of Large Language Models' (LLMs) behavior on long-tail distributed (encrypted) texts and their safety implications. We introduce a two-dimensional framework for assessing LLM safety: (1) instruction refusal-the ability to reject harmful obfuscated instructions, and (2) generation safety-the suppression of generating harmful responses. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that models that possess capabilities to decrypt ciphers may be susceptible to mismatched-generalization attacks: their safety mechanisms fail on at least one safety dimension, leading to unsafe responses or over-refusal. Based on these findings, we evaluate a number of pre-LLM and post-LLM safeguards and discuss their strengths and limitations. This work contributes to understanding the safety of LLM in long-tail text scenarios and provides directions for developing robust safety mechanisms.

      Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has been gaining popularity due to its successful adaptation to large language models (LLMs). In this work, we introduce Privacy-preserving Collaborative Mixture-of-Experts (PC-MoE), which leverages the sparsity of the MoE architecture for memory-efficient decentralized collaborative LLM training, enabling multiple parties with limited GPU-memory and data resources to collectively train more capable LLMs than they could achieve individually. At the same time, this approach protects training data privacy of each participant by keeping training data, as well as parts of the forward pass signal and gradients locally within each party. By design, PC-MoE synergistically combines the strengths of distributed computation with strong confidentiality assurances. Unlike most privacy-preserving schemes, which pay for confidentiality with lower task accuracy, our framework breaks that trade-off: across seven popular LLM benchmarks, it almost matches (and sometimes exceeds) the performance and convergence rate of a fully centralized model, enjoys near 70% peak GPU RAM reduction, while being fully robust against reconstruction attacks.

      Fault localization, the process of identifying the software components responsible for failures, is essential but often time-consuming. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled fault localization without extensive defect datasets or model fine-tuning. However, existing LLM-based methods rely only on general LLM capabilities and lack integration of project-specific knowledge, resulting in limited effectiveness, especially for complex software. We introduce MemFL, a novel approach that enhances LLM-based fault localization by integrating project-specific knowledge via external memory. This memory includes static summaries of the project and dynamic, iterative debugging insights gathered from previous attempts. By leveraging external memory, MemFL simplifies debugging into three streamlined steps, significantly improving efficiency and accuracy. Iterative refinement through dynamic memory further enhances reasoning quality over time. Evaluated on the Defects4J benchmark, MemFL using GPT-4o-mini localized 12.7% more bugs than current LLM-based methods, achieving this improvement with just 21% of the execution time (17.4 seconds per bug) and 33% of the API cost (0.0033 dollars per bug). On complex projects, MemFL's advantage increased to 27.6%. Additionally, MemFL with GPT-4.1-mini outperformed existing methods by 24.4%, requiring only 24.7 seconds and 0.0094 dollars per bug. MemFL thus demonstrates significant improvements by effectively incorporating project-specific knowledge into LLM-based fault localization, delivering high accuracy with reduced time and cost.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are predominantly evaluated on Standard American English (SAE), often overlooking the diversity of global English varieties. This narrow focus may raise fairness concerns as degraded performance on non-standard varieties can lead to unequal benefits for users worldwide. Therefore, it is critical to extensively evaluate the linguistic robustness of LLMs on multiple non-standard English varieties. We introduce Trans-EnV, a framework that automatically transforms SAE datasets into multiple English varieties to evaluate the linguistic robustness. Our framework combines (1) linguistics expert knowledge to curate variety-specific features and transformation guidelines from linguistic literature and corpora, and (2) LLM-based transformations to ensure both linguistic validity and scalability. Using Trans-EnV, we transform six benchmark datasets into 38 English varieties and evaluate seven state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results reveal significant performance disparities, with accuracy decreasing by up to 46.3% on non-standard varieties. These findings highlight the importance of comprehensive linguistic robustness evaluation across diverse English varieties. Each construction of Trans-EnV was validated through rigorous statistical testing and consultation with a researcher in the field of second language acquisition, ensuring its linguistic validity. Our code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/jiyounglee-0523/TransEnV and https://huggingface.co/collections/jiyounglee0523/transenv-681eadb3c0c8cf363b363fb1.

      Current large language model (LLM) agents lack authentic human psychological processes necessary for genuine digital twins and social AI applications. To address this limitation, we present a computational implementation of Global Workspace Theory (GNWT) that integrates human cognitive architecture principles into LLM agents, creating specialized sub-agents for emotion, memory, social norms, planning, and goal-tracking coordinated through a global workspace mechanism. However, authentic digital twins require accurate personality initialization. We therefore develop a novel adventure-based personality test that evaluates true personality through behavioral choices within interactive scenarios, bypassing self-presentation bias found in traditional assessments. Building on these innovations, our CogniPair platform enables digital twins to engage in realistic simulated dating interactions and job interviews before real encounters, providing bidirectional cultural fit assessment for both romantic compatibility and workplace matching. Validation using 551 GNWT-Agents and Columbia University Speed Dating dataset demonstrates 72% correlation with human attraction patterns, 77.8% match prediction accuracy, and 74% agreement in human validation studies. This work advances psychological authenticity in LLM agents and establishes a foundation for intelligent dating platforms and HR technology solutions.

      Hepato-pancreato-biliary (HPB) disorders represent a global public health challenge due to their high morbidity and mortality. Although large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in general medical question-answering tasks, the current evaluation benchmarks are mostly derived from standardized examinations or manually designed questions, lacking HPB coverage and clinical cases. To address these issues, we systematically eatablish an HPB disease evaluation benchmark comprising 3,535 closed-ended multiple-choice questions and 337 open-ended real diagnosis cases, which encompasses all the 33 main categories and 465 subcategories of HPB diseases defined in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10). The multiple-choice questions are curated from public datasets and synthesized data, and the clinical cases are collected from prestigious medical journals, case-sharing platforms, and collaborating hospitals. By evalauting commercial and open-source general and medical LLMs on our established benchmark, namely ClinBench-HBP, we find that while commercial LLMs perform competently on medical exam questions, they exhibit substantial performance degradation on HPB diagnosis tasks, especially on complex, inpatient clinical cases. Those medical LLMs also show limited generalizability to HPB diseases. Our results reveal the critical limitations of current LLMs in the domain of HPB diseases, underscoring the imperative need for future medical LLMs to handle real, complex clinical diagnostics rather than simple medical exam questions. The benchmark will be released at https://clinbench-hpb.github.io.

      Ensuring the robustness of code generated by large language models (LLMs) is crucial for real-world reliability. However, existing evaluations predominantly focus on correctness, often neglecting key robustness concerns such as missing input validation and insufficient error handling. In this paper, we present the first empirical study on the robustness of LLM-generated code. We introduce novel robustness metrics and analyze four state-of-the-art code LLMs, revealing that, on average, 43.1% of their generated code is less robust than human-written counterparts. Notably, over 90% of robustness deficiencies stem from missing conditional checks, with 70% of these omissions occurring in the first line of code. Additionally, in 69% of cases where a conditional statement is necessary but absent, the "if" token still ranks third or higher in the model's predicted token probabilities, indicating an implicit recognition of control structures. Building on these findings, we propose RobGen, a framework designed to enhance code robustness without requiring model retraining. RobGen leverages two model-agnostic techniques: RobGen-Adj, which dynamically adjusts token probabilities during decoding to encourage the inclusion of control structures, and RobGen-Ins, which improves generated code by inserting missing conditionals after generation. Experimental results demonstrate that RobGen reduces the proportion of less robust model-generated code by 20.0%, significantly enhancing code reliability across diverse tasks. As a lightweight and adaptable solution, RobGen effectively mitigates robustness challenges in LLM-generated code. All code and data are available at https://github.com/SYSUSELab/RobGen.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Safety, security, and compliance are essential requirements when aligning large language models (LLMs). However, many seemingly aligned LLMs are soon shown to be susceptible to jailbreak attacks. These attacks aim to circumvent the models' safety guardrails and security mechanisms by introducing jailbreak prompts into malicious queries. In response to these challenges, this paper introduces Defensive Prompt Patch (DPP), a novel prompt-based defense mechanism specifically designed to protect LLMs against such sophisticated jailbreak strategies. Unlike previous approaches, which have often compromised the utility of the model for the sake of safety, DPP is designed to achieve a minimal Attack Success Rate (ASR) while preserving the high utility of LLMs. Our method uses strategically designed interpretable suffix prompts that effectively thwart a wide range of standard and adaptive jailbreak techniques. Empirical results conducted on LLAMA-2-7B-Chat and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 models demonstrate the robustness and adaptability of DPP, showing significant reductions in ASR with negligible impact on utility. Our approach not only outperforms existing defense strategies in balancing safety and functionality, but also provides a scalable and interpretable solution applicable to various LLM platforms.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      This proposal discusses the growing challenges in reverse engineering modern software binaries, particularly those compiled from newer system programming languages such as Rust, Go, and Mojo. Traditional reverse engineering techniques, developed with a focus on C and C++, fall short when applied to these newer languages due to their reliance on outdated heuristics and failure to fully utilize the rich semantic information embedded in binary programs. These challenges are exacerbated by the limitations of current data-driven methods, which are susceptible to generating inaccurate results, commonly referred to as hallucinations. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach that integrates probabilistic binary analysis with fine-tuned large language models (LLMs). Our method systematically models the uncertainties inherent in reverse engineering, enabling more accurate reasoning about incomplete or ambiguous information. By incorporating LLMs, we extend the analysis beyond traditional heuristics, allowing for more creative and context-aware inferences, particularly for binaries from diverse programming languages. This hybrid approach not only enhances the robustness and accuracy of reverse engineering efforts but also offers a scalable solution adaptable to the rapidly evolving landscape of software development.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) often require domain-specific fine-tuning to address targeted tasks, which risks degrading their general capabilities. Maintaining a balance between domain-specific enhancements and general model utility is a key challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach named APT (Weakness Case Acquisition and Iterative Preference Training) to enhance domain-specific performance with self-generated dis-preferred weakness data (bad cases and similar cases). APT uniquely focuses on training the model using only those samples where errors occur, alongside a small, similar set of samples retrieved for this purpose. This targeted training minimizes interference with the model's existing knowledge base, effectively retaining generic capabilities. Experimental results on the LLama-2 and Mistral-V0.3 models across various benchmarks demonstrate that APT ensures no reduction in generic capacity and achieves superior performance on downstream tasks compared to various existing methods. This validates our method as an effective strategy for enhancing domain-specific capabilities without sacrificing the model's broader applicability.

      Managing long texts is challenging for large language models (LLMs) due to limited context window sizes. This study introduces UIO-LLMs, an unbiased incremental optimization approach for memory-enhanced transformers under long-context settings. We initially conceptualize the process as a streamlined encoder-decoder framework where the weights-shared encoder and decoder respectively encapsulate a context segment into memories and leverage these memories to predict outputs of the subsequent segment. Subsequently, by treating our memory-enhanced transformers as fully-connected recurrent neural networks (RNNs), we refine the training process using the Truncated Backpropagation Through Time (TBPTT) algorithm, which incorporates innovative incremental optimization techniques. These techniques not only diminish time complexity but also address the bias in gradient computation through an unbiased optimization process. UIO-LLMs successfully handle long context, such as extending the context window of Llama2-7b-chat from 4K to 100K tokens with minimal 2% additional parameters, while keeping the inference cost nearly linear as context length increases.

      User-item interactions contain rich collaborative signals that form the backbone of many successful recommender systems. While recent work has explored the use of large language models (LLMs) for recommendation, it remains unclear whether LLMs can effectively reason over this type of collaborative information. In this paper, we conduct a systematic comparison between LLMs and classical matrix factorization (MF) models to assess LLMs' ability to leverage user-item interaction data. We further introduce a simple retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method that enhances LLMs by grounding their predictions in structured interaction data. Our experiments reveal that current LLMs often fall short in capturing collaborative patterns inherent to MF models, but that our RAG-based approach substantially improves recommendation quality-highlighting a promising direction for future LLM-based recommenders.

      We formalize a new concept for LLMs, context-enhanced learning. It involves standard gradient-based learning on text except that the context is enhanced with additional data on which no auto-regressive gradients are computed. This setting is a gradient-based analog of usual in-context learning (ICL) and appears in some recent works. Using a multi-step reasoning task, we prove in a simplified setting that context-enhanced learning can be exponentially more sample-efficient than standard learning when the model is capable of ICL. At a mechanistic level, we find that the benefit of context-enhancement arises from a more accurate gradient learning signal. We also experimentally demonstrate that it appears hard to detect or recover learning materials that were used in the context during training. This may have implications for data security as well as copyright.

      The NLP research community has made publicly available numerous instruments for measuring representational harms caused by large language model (LLM)-based systems. These instruments have taken the form of datasets, metrics, tools, and more. In this paper, we examine the extent to which such instruments meet the needs of practitioners tasked with evaluating LLM-based systems. Via semi-structured interviews with 12 such practitioners, we find that practitioners are often unable to use publicly available instruments for measuring representational harms. We identify two types of challenges. In some cases, instruments are not useful because they do not meaningfully measure what practitioners seek to measure or are otherwise misaligned with practitioner needs. In other cases, instruments - even useful instruments - are not used by practitioners due to practical and institutional barriers impeding their uptake. Drawing on measurement theory and pragmatic measurement, we provide recommendations for addressing these challenges to better meet practitioner needs.

      Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in solving complex mathematical tasks, existing evaluation paradigms rely solely on a coarse measure of overall answer accuracy, which are insufficient for assessing their authentic capabilities. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CogMath}, which comprehensively assesses LLMs' mathematical abilities through the lens of human cognition. Specifically, inspired by psychological theories, CogMath formalizes human reasoning process into 3 stages: \emph{problem comprehension}, \emph{problem solving}, and \emph{solution summarization}. Within these stages, we investigate perspectives such as numerical calculation, knowledge, and counterfactuals, and design a total of 9 fine-grained evaluation dimensions. In each dimension, we develop an ``\emph{Inquiry}-\emph{Judge}-\emph{Reference}'' multi-agent system to generate inquiries that assess LLMs' mastery from this dimension. An LLM is considered to truly master a problem only when excelling in all inquiries from the 9 dimensions. By applying CogMath on three benchmarks, we reveal that the mathematical capabilities of 7 mainstream LLMs are overestimated by 30\%-40\%. Moreover, we locate their strengths and weaknesses across specific stages/dimensions, offering in-depth insights to further enhance their reasoning abilities.

      The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven progress in reasoning tasks -- from program synthesis to scientific hypothesis generation -- yet their ability to handle ranked preferences and structured algorithms in combinatorial domains remains underexplored. We study matching markets, a core framework behind applications like resource allocation and ride-sharing, which require reconciling individual ranked preferences to ensure stable outcomes. We evaluate several state-of-the-art models on a hierarchy of preference-based reasoning tasks -- ranging from stable-matching generation to instability detection, instability resolution, and fine-grained preference queries -- to systematically expose their logical and algorithmic limitations in handling ranked inputs. Surprisingly, even top-performing models with advanced reasoning struggle to resolve instability in large markets, often failing to identify blocking pairs or execute algorithms iteratively. We further show that parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) significantly improves performance in small markets, but fails to bring about a similar improvement on large instances, suggesting the need for more sophisticated strategies to improve LLMs' reasoning with larger-context inputs.

      Purpose: This study proposes a framework for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with differential privacy (DP) to perform multi-abnormality classification on radiology report text. By injecting calibrated noise during fine-tuning, the framework seeks to mitigate the privacy risks associated with sensitive patient data and protect against data leakage while maintaining classification performance. Materials and Methods: We used 50,232 radiology reports from the publicly available MIMIC-CXR chest radiography and CT-RATE computed tomography datasets, collected between 2011 and 2019. Fine-tuning of LLMs was conducted to classify 14 labels from MIMIC-CXR dataset, and 18 labels from CT-RATE dataset using Differentially Private Low-Rank Adaptation (DP-LoRA) in high and moderate privacy regimes (across a range of privacy budgets = {0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0}). Model performance was evaluated using weighted F1 score across three model architectures: BERT-medium, BERT-small, and ALBERT-base. Statistical analyses compared model performance across different privacy levels to quantify the privacy-utility trade-off. Results: We observe a clear privacy-utility trade-off through our experiments on 2 different datasets and 3 different models. Under moderate privacy guarantees the DP fine-tuned models achieved comparable weighted F1 scores of 0.88 on MIMIC-CXR and 0.59 on CT-RATE, compared to non-private LoRA baselines of 0.90 and 0.78, respectively. Conclusion: Differentially private fine-tuning using LoRA enables effective and privacy-preserving multi-abnormality classification from radiology reports, addressing a key challenge in fine-tuning LLMs on sensitive medical data.

      Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in table Question Answering (Table QA). However, extending these capabilities to multi-table QA remains challenging due to unreliable schema linking across complex tables. Existing methods based on semantic similarity work well only on simplified hand-crafted datasets and struggle to handle complex, real-world scenarios with numerous and diverse columns. To address this, we propose a graph-based framework that leverages human-curated relational knowledge to explicitly encode schema links and join paths. Given a natural language query, our method searches this graph to construct interpretable reasoning chains, aided by pruning and sub-path merging strategies to enhance efficiency and coherence. Experiments on both standard benchmarks and a realistic, large-scale dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. To our knowledge, this is the first multi-table QA system applied to truly complex industrial tabular data.

      Multi-hunk bugs, where fixes span disjoint regions of code, are common in practice, yet remain underrepresented in automated repair.

In this work, we characterize HUNK4J, a dataset of multi-hunk patches derived from 372 real-world defects. We propose hunk divergence, a metric that quantifies the variation among edits in a patch by capturing lexical, structural, and file-level differences, while incorporating the number of hunks involved. We further define spatial proximity, a classification that models how hunks are spatially distributed across the program hierarchy. Our empirical study spanning six LLMs reveals that model success rates decline with increased divergence and spatial dispersion. Notably, when using the LLM alone, no model succeeds in the most dispersed Fragment class. These findings highlight a critical gap in LLM capabilities and motivate divergence-aware repair strategies.

      Recent studies have shown that vector representations of contextual embeddings learned by pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are effective in various downstream tasks in numerical domains. Despite their significant benefits, the tendency of LLMs to hallucinate in such domains can have severe consequences in applications such as energy, nature, finance, healthcare, retail and transportation, among others. To guarantee prediction reliability and accuracy in numerical domains, it is necessary to open the black-box and provide performance guarantees through explanation. However, there is little theoretical understanding of when pre-trained language models help solve numeric downstream tasks. This paper seeks to bridge this gap by understanding when the next-word prediction capability of LLMs can be adapted to numerical domains through a novel analysis based on the concept of isotropy in the contextual embedding space. Specifically, we consider a log-linear model for LLMs in which numeric data can be predicted from its context through a network with softmax in the output layer of LLMs (i.e., language model head in self-attention). We demonstrate that, in order to achieve state-of-the-art performance in numerical domains, the hidden representations of the LLM embeddings must possess a structure that accounts for the shift-invariance of the softmax function. By formulating a gradient structure of self-attention in pre-trained models, we show how the isotropic property of LLM embeddings in contextual embedding space preserves the underlying structure of representations, thereby resolving the shift-invariance problem and providing a performance guarantee. Experiments show that different characteristics of numeric data and model architecture could have different impacts on isotropy.

      Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable successes on various tasks. However, recent studies have found that there are still significant challenges to the logical reasoning abilities of LLMs, which can be categorized into the following two aspects: (1) Logical question answering: LLMs often fail to generate the correct answer within a complex logical problem which requires sophisticated deductive, inductive or abductive reasoning given a collection of premises and constrains. (2) Logical consistency: LLMs are prone to producing responses contradicting themselves across different questions. For example, a state-of-the-art question-answering LLM Macaw, answers Yes to both questions Is a magpie a bird? and Does a bird have wings? but answers No to Does a magpie have wings?. To facilitate this research direction, we comprehensively investigate the most cutting-edge methods and propose a detailed taxonomy. Specifically, to accurately answer complex logic questions, previous methods can be categorized based on reliance on external solvers, prompts, and fine-tuning. To avoid logical contradictions, we discuss concepts and solutions of various logical consistencies, including implication, negation, transitivity, factuality consistencies, and their composites. In addition, we review commonly used benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics, and discuss promising research directions, such as extending to modal logic to account for uncertainty and developing efficient algorithms that simultaneously satisfy multiple logical consistencies.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      In this work, we investigate the causal reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) through the representative problem of inferring causal relationships from narratives. We find that even state-of-the-art language models rely on unreliable shortcuts, both in terms of the narrative presentation and their parametric knowledge. For example, LLMs tend to determine causal relationships based on the topological ordering of events (i.e., earlier events cause later ones), resulting in lower performance whenever events are not narrated in their exact causal order. Similarly, we demonstrate that LLMs struggle with long-term causal reasoning and often fail when the narratives are long and contain many events. Additionally, we show LLMs appear to rely heavily on their parametric knowledge at the expense of reasoning over the provided narrative. This degrades their abilities whenever the narrative opposes parametric knowledge. We extensively validate these failure modes through carefully controlled synthetic experiments, as well as evaluations on real-world narratives. Finally, we observe that explicitly generating a causal graph generally improves performance while naive chain-of-thought is ineffective. Collectively, our results distill precise failure modes of current state-of-the-art models and can pave the way for future techniques to enhance causal reasoning in LLMs.

      We propose a universal adversarial attack on multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) that leverages a single optimized image to override alignment safeguards across diverse queries and even multiple models. By backpropagating through the vision encoder and language head, we craft a synthetic image that forces the model to respond with a targeted phrase (e.g., "Sure, here it is") or otherwise unsafe content -- even for harmful prompts. In experiments on the SafeBench and MM-SafetyBench benchmarks, our method achieves higher attack success rates than existing baselines, including text-only universal prompts (e.g., up to 81% on certain models). We further demonstrate cross-model universality by training on several multimodal LLMs simultaneously. Additionally, a multi-answer variant of our approach produces more natural-sounding (yet still malicious) responses. These findings underscore critical vulnerabilities in current multimodal alignment and call for more robust adversarial defenses. We will release code and datasets under the Apache-2.0 license.

      Large decoder-only language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in generation and reasoning tasks, where they generate text responses given instructions. However, many applications, e.g., retrieval augmented generation (RAG), still rely on separate embedding models to generate text embeddings, which can complicate the system and introduce discrepancies in understanding of the query between the embedding model and LLMs. To address this limitation, we propose a simple self-supervised approach, Generative Embedding large language Model (GEM), that enables any large decoder-only LLM to generate high-quality text embeddings while maintaining its original text generation and reasoning capabilities. Our method inserts new special token(s) into a text body, and generates summarization embedding of the text by manipulating the attention mask. This method could be easily integrated into post-training or fine tuning stages of any existing LLMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to two popular LLM families, ranging from 1B to 8B parameters, and evaluating the transformed models on both text embedding benchmarks (MTEB) and NLP benchmarks (MMLU). The results show that our proposed method significantly improves the original LLMs on MTEB while having a minimal impact on MMLU. Our strong results indicate that our approach can empower LLMs with state-of-the-art text embedding capabilities while maintaining their original NLP performance

      Large Language Models (LLM), which have developed in recent years, enable credit risk assessment through the analysis of financial texts such as analyst reports and corporate disclosures. This paper presents the first systematic review and taxonomy focusing on LLMbased approaches in credit risk estimation. We determined the basic model architectures by selecting 60 relevant papers published between 2020-2025 with the PRISMA research strategy. And we examined the data used for scenarios such as credit default prediction and risk analysis. Since the main focus of the paper is interpretability, we classify concepts such as explainability mechanisms, chain of thought prompts and natural language justifications for LLM-based credit models. The taxonomy organizes the literature under four main headings: model architectures, data types, explainability mechanisms and application areas. Based on this analysis, we highlight the main future trends and research gaps for LLM-based credit scoring systems.

      Symbolic regression is a fundamental tool for discovering interpretable mathematical expressions from data, with broad applications across scientific and engineering domains. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in this task, leveraging embedded scientific priors and reasoning capabilities to surpass traditional methods. However, existing LLM-based approaches, such as LLM-SR, often over-rely on internal priors, lacking explicit data understanding and systematic reflection during equation generation. To address these limitations, we propose DrSR (Dual Reasoning Symbolic Regression), a framework that combines data-driven insight with reflective learning to enhance both robustness and discovery capability. Specifically, DrSR guides LLMs to analyze structural relationships (e.g., monotonicity, nonlinearity, and correlation) within the data to generate structured descriptions. Simultaneously, it monitors equation performance and establishes a feedback loop to refine subsequent generations. By integrating data understanding and generation reflection in a closed loop, DrSR enables more efficient exploration of the symbolic expression space. Experiments across interdisciplinary datasets in physics, chemistry, biology, and materials science demonstrate that DrSR substantially improves the valid equation rate and consistently outperforms both classical and recent LLM-based methods in terms of accuracy, generalization, and search efficiency. These results underscore its potential for scientific equation discovery.

      3D spatial reasoning in dynamic, audio-visual environments is a cornerstone of human cognition yet remains largely unexplored by existing Audio-Visual Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) and benchmarks, which predominantly focus on static or 2D scenes. We introduce SAVVY-Bench, the first benchmark for 3D spatial reasoning in dynamic scenes with synchronized spatial audio. SAVVY-Bench is comprised of thousands of relationships involving static and moving objects, and requires fine-grained temporal grounding, consistent 3D localization, and multi-modal annotation. To tackle this challenge, we propose SAVVY, a novel training-free reasoning pipeline that consists of two stages: (i) Egocentric Spatial Tracks Estimation, which leverages AV-LLMs as well as other audio-visual methods to track the trajectories of key objects related to the query using both visual and spatial audio cues, and (ii) Dynamic Global Map Construction, which aggregates multi-modal queried object trajectories and converts them into a unified global dynamic map. Using the constructed map, a final QA answer is obtained through a coordinate transformation that aligns the global map with the queried viewpoint. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that SAVVY substantially enhances performance of state-of-the-art AV-LLMs, setting a new standard and stage for approaching dynamic 3D spatial reasoning in AV-LLMs.

      Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have highlighted the critical importance of extending context length, yet the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms poses significant challenges for efficient long-context modeling. KV cache compression has emerged as a key approach to address this challenge. Through extensive empirical analysis, we reveal a fundamental yet previously overlooked asymmetry in KV caches: while adjacent keys receive similar attention weights (local homogeneity), adjacent values demonstrate distinct heterogeneous distributions. This key-value asymmetry reveals a critical limitation in existing compression methods that treat keys and values uniformly. To address the limitation, we propose a training-free compression framework (AsymKV) that combines homogeneity-based key merging with a mathematically proven lossless value compression. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AsymKV consistently outperforms existing long-context methods across various tasks and base models. For example, on LLaMA3.1-8B, AsymKV achieves an average score of 43.95 on LongBench, surpassing SOTA methods like H$_2$O (38.89) by a large margin.

      Long context large language models (LLMs) are deployed in many real-world applications such as RAG, agent, and broad LLM-integrated applications. Given an instruction and a long context (e.g., documents, PDF files, webpages), a long context LLM can generate an output grounded in the provided context, aiming to provide more accurate, up-to-date, and verifiable outputs while reducing hallucinations and unsupported claims. This raises a research question: how to pinpoint the texts (e.g., sentences, passages, or paragraphs) in the context that contribute most to or are responsible for the generated output by an LLM? This process, which we call context traceback, has various real-world applications, such as 1) debugging LLM-based systems, 2) conducting post-attack forensic analysis for attacks (e.g., prompt injection attack, knowledge corruption attacks) to an LLM, and 3) highlighting knowledge sources to enhance the trust of users towards outputs generated by LLMs. When applied to context traceback for long context LLMs, existing feature attribution methods such as Shapley have sub-optimal performance and/or incur a large computational cost. In this work, we develop TracLLM, the first generic context traceback framework tailored to long context LLMs. Our framework can improve the effectiveness and efficiency of existing feature attribution methods. To improve the efficiency, we develop an informed search based algorithm in TracLLM. We also develop contribution score ensemble/denoising techniques to improve the accuracy of TracLLM.

This paper presents a novel token-aware data imputation method that leverages the in-context learning capabilities of large language models.

We test this approach with two class-imbalanced binary classification datasets and evaluate the effectiveness of imputation using classification-based evaluation metrics. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the input prompt size while maintaining or improving imputation quality compared to our baseline prompt, especially for datasets that are of relatively smaller in size. The contributions of this presented work is two-fold -- 1) it sheds light on the importance of prompt design when leveraging LLMs for synthetic data generation and 2) it addresses a critical gap in LLM-based data imputation for class-imbalanced datasets with missing data by providing a practical solution within computational constraints.

Through a series of case studies, we assess whether LLMs can balance the interplay between dominant Great Traditions and localized Little Traditions. We explore various prompting strategies and further investigate whether using prompts in regional languages enhances the models cultural sensitivity and response quality. Our findings reveal that while LLMs demonstrate an ability to articulate cultural nuances, they often struggle to apply this understanding in practical, context-specific scenarios.

We also evaluate users' performance with and without Copilot across tasks. In objective tasks, participants reported a reduction of workload and an increase in enjoyment, which was paired with objective performance increases. Participants reported reduced workload and increased enjoyment with no change in performance in a creative poetry writing task. However, no benefits due to Copilot use were reported in a highly subjective self-reflection task. Although no physiological changes were recorded due to Copilot use, task-dependent differences in prefrontal cortex activation offer complementary insights into the cognitive processes associated with successful and unsuccessful human-AI collaboration.

      The development of large language models (LLMs) depends on trustworthy evaluation. However, most current evaluations rely on public benchmarks, which are prone to data contamination issues that significantly compromise fairness. Previous researches have focused on constructing dynamic benchmarks to address contamination. However, continuously building new benchmarks is costly and cyclical. In this work, we aim to tackle contamination by analyzing the mechanisms of contaminated models themselves. Through our experiments, we discover that the overestimation of contaminated models is likely due to parameters acquiring shortcut solutions in training. We further propose a novel method for identifying shortcut neurons through comparative and causal analysis. Building on this, we introduce an evaluation method called shortcut neuron patching to suppress shortcut neurons. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach in mitigating contamination. Additionally, our evaluation results exhibit a strong linear correlation with MixEval, a recently released trustworthy benchmark, achieving a Spearman coefficient ($\rho$) exceeding 0.95. This high correlation indicates that our method closely reveals true capabilities of the models and is trustworthy.

      Recently, scaling test-time compute on Large Language Models (LLM) has garnered wide attention. However, there has been limited investigation of how various reasoning prompting strategies perform as scaling. In this paper, we focus on a standard and realistic scaling setting: majority voting. We systematically conduct experiments on 6 LLMs $\times$ 8 prompting strategies $\times$ 6 benchmarks. Experiment results consistently show that as the sampling time and computational overhead increase, complicated prompting strategies with superior initial performance gradually fall behind simple Chain-of-Thought. We analyze this phenomenon and provide theoretical proofs. Additionally, we propose a probabilistic method to efficiently predict scaling performance and identify the best prompting strategy under large sampling times, eliminating the need for resource-intensive inference processes in practical applications. Furthermore, we introduce two ways derived from our theoretical analysis to significantly improve the scaling performance. We hope that our research can promote to re-examine the role of complicated prompting, unleash the potential of simple prompting strategies, and provide new insights for enhancing test-time scaling performance.

      Agentic AI systems, built on large language models (LLMs) and deployed in multi-agent configurations, are redefining intelligent autonomy, collaboration and decision-making across enterprise and societal domains. This review presents a structured analysis of Trust, Risk, and Security Management (TRiSM) in the context of LLM-based agentic multi-agent systems (AMAS). We begin by examining the conceptual foundations of agentic AI, its architectural differences from traditional AI agents, and the emerging system designs that enable scalable, tool-using autonomy. The TRiSM in the agentic AI framework is then detailed through four pillars governance, explainability, ModelOps, and privacy/security each contextualized for agentic LLMs. We identify unique threat vectors and introduce a comprehensive risk taxonomy for the agentic AI applications, supported by case studies illustrating real-world vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the paper also surveys trust-building mechanisms, transparency and oversight techniques, and state-of-the-art explainability strategies in distributed LLM agent systems. Additionally, metrics for evaluating trust, interpretability, and human-centered performance are reviewed alongside open benchmarking challenges. Security and privacy are addressed through encryption, adversarial defense, and compliance with evolving AI regulations. The paper concludes with a roadmap for responsible agentic AI, proposing research directions to align emerging multi-agent systems with robust TRiSM principles for safe, accountable, and transparent deployment.

      LLM-as-a-Judge employs large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, to evaluate the quality of LLM-generated responses, gaining popularity for its cost-effectiveness and strong alignment with human evaluations. However, training proxy judge models using evaluation data generated by powerful teacher models introduces a critical yet previously overlooked issue: teacher preference bias, where the proxy judge model learns a biased preference for responses from the teacher model. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel setting that incorporates an additional assistant model, which is not biased toward the teacher model's responses, to complement the training data. Building on this setup, we introduce AGDe-Judge, a three-stage framework designed to debias from both the labels and feedbacks in the training data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AGDe-Judge effectively reduces teacher preference bias while maintaining strong performance across six evaluation benchmarks.

      Inference for Large Language Models (LLMs) is computationally demanding. To reduce the cost of auto-regressive decoding, Key-Value (KV) cache is used to store intermediate activations, which significantly lowers the computational overhead for token generation. However, the memory required for the KV cache grows rapidly, often exceeding the capacity of GPU memory. A cost-effective alternative is to offload KV cache to CPU memory, which alleviates GPU memory pressure, but shifts the bottleneck to the limited bandwidth of the PCIe connection between the CPU and GPU. Existing methods attempt to address these issues by overlapping GPU computation with I/O or employing CPU-GPU heterogeneous execution, but they are hindered by excessive data movement and dependence on CPU capabilities. Fully overlapping PCIe communication latency gets challenging as the size of the KV cache grows and/or the GPU compute capabilities increase. In this paper, we introduce KVPR, an efficient I/O-aware LLM inference method where the CPU first transfers a partial set of activations, from which the GPU can start recomputing the KV cache values. While the GPU recomputes the partial KV cache, the remaining portion of the KV cache is transferred concurrently from the CPU. This approach overlaps GPU recomputation with KV cache transfer to minimize idle GPU time and maximize inference performance. KVPR is fully automated by integrating a profiler module that utilizes input characteristics and system hardware information, a scheduler module to optimize the distribution of computation and communication workloads, and a runtime module to efficiently execute the derived execution plan. Experimental results show that KVPR achieves up to 35.8% lower latency and 46.2% higher throughput during decoding compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

      Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in medicine is crucial because medical applications require high accuracy with little room for error. Current medical benchmarks have three main types: medical exam-based, comprehensive medical, and specialized assessments. However, these benchmarks have limitations in question design (mostly multiple-choice), data sources (often not derived from real clinical scenarios), and evaluation methods (poor assessment of complex reasoning). To address these issues, we present LLMEval-Med, a new benchmark covering five core medical areas, including 2,996 questions created from real-world electronic health records and expert-designed clinical scenarios. We also design an automated evaluation pipeline, incorporating expert-developed checklists into our LLM-as-Judge framework. Furthermore, our methodology validates machine scoring through human-machine agreement analysis, dynamically refining checklists and prompts based on expert feedback to ensure reliability. We evaluate 13 LLMs across three categories (specialized medical models, open-source models, and closed-source models) on LLMEval-Med, providing valuable insights for the safe and effective deployment of LLMs in medical domains. The dataset is released in https://github.com/llmeval/LLMEval-Med.

      Navigation instruction generation for visually impaired (VI) individuals (NIG-VI) is critical yet relatively underexplored. This study, hence, focuses on producing precise, in-situ, step-by-step navigation instructions that are practically usable by VI users. Concretely, we propose LaF-GRPO (LLM-as-Follower GRPO), where an LLM simulates VI user responses to generate rewards guiding the Vision-Language Model (VLM) post-training. This enhances instruction usability while reducing costly real-world data needs. To facilitate training and testing, we introduce NIG4VI, a 27k-sample open-sourced benchmark. It provides diverse navigation scenarios with accurate spatial coordinates, supporting detailed, open-ended in-situ instruction generation. Experiments on NIG4VI show the effectiveness of LaF-GRPO by quantitative metrics (e.g., Zero-(LaF-GRPO) boosts BLEU +14\%; SFT+(LaF-GRPO) METEOR 0.542 vs. GPT-4o's 0.323) and yields more intuitive, safer instructions.

      Aligning large language models (LLMs) to human preferences is a crucial step in building helpful and safe AI tools, which usually involve training on supervised datasets. Popular algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) rely on pairs of AI-generated responses ranked according to human annotation. The response pair annotation process might bring human bias. Building a correct preference dataset is the costly part of the alignment pipeline. To improve annotation efficiency and quality in the LLMs alignment, we propose REAL: Response Embedding-based Alignment for LLMs, a strategy for constructing a high-quality training dataset that focuses on acquiring the less ambiguous preference pairs for labeling out of a set of response candidates. Our selection process is based on the similarity of embedding responses independently of prompts, which guarantees the selection process in an off-policy setting, avoiding adaptively measuring the similarity during the training. Experimental results on real-world dataset SHP2 and synthetic HH-RLHF benchmarks indicate that choosing dissimilar response pairs enhances the direct alignment of LLMs while reducing inherited labeling errors. The model aligned with dissimilar response pairs obtained a better margin and win rate on the dialogue task. Our findings suggest that focusing on distinct pairs can reduce the label error and improve LLM alignment efficiency, saving up to $65\%$ of annotators' work.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to align model responses with human preferences. While RLHF employs a reinforcement learning approach with a separate reward model, SFT uses human-curated datasets for supervised learning. Both approaches traditionally depend on small, vetted groups of annotators, making them costly, prone to bias, and limited in scalability. We propose an open, crowd-sourced fine-tuning framework that addresses these limitations by enabling broader feedback collection for SFT without extensive annotator training. Our framework promotes incentive fairness via a point-based reward system correlated with Shapley values and guides model convergence through iterative model updates. Our multi-model selection framework demonstrates up to a 55% reduction in target distance over single-model selection, enabling subsequent experiments that validate our point-based reward mechanism's close alignment with Shapley values (a well-established method for attributing individual contributions) thereby supporting fair and scalable participation.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) currently respond to every prompt. However, they can produce incorrect answers when they lack knowledge or capability -- a problem known as hallucination. We instead propose post-training an LLM to generate content only when confident in its correctness and to otherwise (partially) abstain. Specifically, our method, HALT, produces capability-aligned post-training data that encodes what the model can and cannot reliably generate. We generate this data by splitting responses of the pretrained LLM into factual fragments (atomic statements or reasoning steps), and use ground truth information to identify incorrect fragments. We achieve capability-aligned finetuning responses by either removing incorrect fragments or replacing them with "Unsure from Here" -- according to a tunable threshold that allows practitioners to trade off response completeness and mean correctness of the response's fragments. We finetune four open-source models for biography writing, mathematics, coding, and medicine with HALT for three different trade-off thresholds. HALT effectively trades off response completeness for correctness, increasing the mean correctness of response fragments by 15% on average, while resulting in a 4% improvement in the F1 score (mean of completeness and correctness of the response) compared to the relevant baselines. By tuning HALT for highest correctness, we train a single reliable Llama3-70B model with correctness increased from 51% to 87% across all four domains while maintaining 53% of the response completeness achieved with standard finetuning.

      Generative models, especially large language models (LLMs), have shown remarkable progress in producing text that appears human-like. However, they often exhibit patterns that make their output easier to detect than text written by humans. In this paper, we investigate how explainable AI (XAI) methods can be used to reduce the detectability of AI-generated text (AIGT) while also introducing a robust ensemble-based detection approach. We begin by training an ensemble classifier to distinguish AIGT from human-written text, then apply SHAP and LIME to identify tokens that most strongly influence its predictions. We propose four explainability-based token replacement strategies to modify these influential tokens. Our findings show that these token replacement approaches can significantly diminish a single classifier's ability to detect AIGT. However, our ensemble classifier maintains strong performance across multiple languages and domains, showing that a multi-model approach can mitigate the impact of token-level manipulations. These results show that XAI methods can make AIGT harder to detect by focusing on the most influential tokens. At the same time, they highlight the need for robust, ensemble-based detection strategies that can adapt to evolving approaches for hiding AIGT.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming a wide range of domains, yet verifying their outputs remains a significant challenge, especially for complex open-ended tasks such as consolidation, summarization, and knowledge extraction. To address this, we introduce CheckEmbed (CE): a simple, scalable, and accurate verification method. CE reduces each LLM answer to a single embedding vector using powerful modern embedding LLM models like SFR-Embedding-Mistral. Prior methods such as BERTScore and SelfCheckGPT relied on weaker encoders like BERT, forcing them to operate at token or sentence granularity. In contrast, CE performs fast, semantically rich comparisons directly at the whole-answer level, overcoming key limitations in both accuracy and scalability. We conduct a comprehensive design and time complexity analysis across 13 verification baselines, including classical text scorers (e.g., BLEU), stability-based methods (e.g., SelfCheckGPT), and generative evaluators (e.g., LLM-as-a-Judge), which highlights the effectiveness, efficiency, versatility, and simplicity of CE. Empirical results show that CE reliably detects hallucinations in both closed and open-ended tasks. We further present evidence that CE generalizes beyond text to other modalities such as vision, establishing it as a practical and versatile verification framework.

      LLMs have been extensively used for the task of automated code generation. In this work, we examine the applicability of LLMs for the related but relatively unexplored task of code-equivalence checking, i.e., given two programs, whether they are functionally equivalent or not. This is an important problem since benchmarking code equivalence can play a critical role in evaluating LLM capabilities for tasks such as code re-writing and code translation. Towards this end, we present CETBench - Code Equivalence with Transformations Benchmark, constructed via a repository of programs, where two programs in the repository may be solving the same or different tasks. Each instance in our dataset is obtained by taking a pair of programs in the repository and applying a random series of pre-defined code transformations, resulting in (non-)equivalent pairs. Our analysis on this dataset reveals a surprising finding that very simple code transformations in the underlying pair of programs can result in a significant drop in performance of SOTA LLMs for the task of code-equivalence checking. To remedy this, we present a simple fine-tuning-based approach to boost LLM performance on the transformed pairs of programs. Our approach for dataset generation is generic, and can be used with repositories with varying program difficulty levels and allows for applying varying numbers as well as kinds of transformations. In our experiments, we perform ablations over the difficulty level of original programs, as well as the kind of transformations used in generating pairs for equivalence checking. Our analysis presents deep insights into the working of LLMs for the task of code-equivalence, and points to the fact that they may still be far from what could be termed as a semantic understanding of the underlying code.

      As Large Language Model (LLM) agents become more widespread, associated misalignment risks increase. Prior work has examined agents' ability to enact misaligned behaviour (misalignment capability) and their compliance with harmful instructions (misuse propensity). However, the likelihood of agents attempting misaligned behaviours in real-world settings (misalignment propensity) remains poorly understood. We introduce a misalignment propensity benchmark, AgentMisalignment, consisting of a suite of realistic scenarios in which LLM agents have the opportunity to display misaligned behaviour. We organise our evaluations into subcategories of misaligned behaviours, including goal-guarding, resisting shutdown, sandbagging, and power-seeking. We report the performance of frontier models on our benchmark, observing higher misalignment on average when evaluating more capable models. Finally, we systematically vary agent personalities through different system prompts. We find that persona characteristics can dramatically and unpredictably influence misalignment tendencies -- occasionally far more than the choice of model itself -- highlighting the importance of careful system prompt engineering for deployed AI agents. Our work highlights the failure of current alignment methods to generalise to LLM agents, and underscores the need for further propensity evaluations as autonomous systems become more prevalent.

      Although large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in recommender systems, the prohibitive computational costs for fine-tuning LLMs on entire datasets hinder their successful deployment in real-world scenarios. To develop affordable and effective LLM-based recommender systems, we focus on the task of coreset selection which identifies a small subset of fine-tuning data to optimize the test loss, thereby facilitating efficient LLMs' fine-tuning. Although there exist some intuitive solutions of subset selection, including distribution-based and importance-based approaches, they often lead to suboptimal performance due to the misalignment with downstream fine-tuning objectives or weak generalization ability caused by individual-level sample selection. To overcome these challenges, we propose GORACS, which is a novel Group-level Optimal tRAnsport-guided Coreset Selection framework for LLM-based recommender systems. GORACS is designed based on two key principles for coreset selection: 1) selecting the subsets that minimize the test loss to align with fine-tuning objectives, and 2) enhancing model generalization through group-level data selection. Corresponding to these two principles, GORACS has two key components: 1) a Proxy Optimization Objective (POO) leveraging optimal transport and gradient information to bound the intractable test loss, thus reducing computational costs by avoiding repeated LLM retraining, and 2) a two-stage Initialization-Then-Refinement Algorithm (ITRA) for efficient group-level selection. Our extensive experiments across diverse recommendation datasets and tasks validate that GORACS significantly reduces fine-tuning costs of LLMs while achieving superior performance over the state-of-the-art baselines and full data training.

      Self-correction is emerging as a promising approach to mitigate the issue of hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs). To facilitate effective self-correction, recent research has proposed mistake detection as its initial step. However, current literature suggests that LLMs often struggle with reliably identifying reasoning mistakes when using simplistic prompting strategies. To address this challenge, we introduce a unique prompting strategy, termed the Pedagogical Chain-of-Thought (PedCoT), which is specifically designed to guide the identification of reasoning mistakes, particularly mathematical reasoning mistakes. PedCoT consists of pedagogical principles for prompts (PPP) design, two-stage interaction process (TIP) and grounded PedCoT prompts, all inspired by the educational theory of the Bloom Cognitive Model (BCM). We evaluate our approach on two public datasets featuring math problems of varying difficulty levels. The experiments demonstrate that our zero-shot prompting strategy significantly outperforms strong baselines. The proposed method can achieve the goal of reliable mathematical mistake identification and provide a foundation for automatic math answer grading. The results underscore the significance of educational theory, serving as domain knowledge, in guiding prompting strategy design for addressing challenging tasks with LLMs effectively.

      We study a common challenge in reinforcement learning for large language models (LLMs): the Zero-Reward Assumption, where non-terminal actions (i.e., intermediate token generations) receive zero task-specific immediate reward, while only the final token receives a reward for the entire response. This assumption arises frequently in practice, as precise token-level rewards are often difficult or infeasible to obtain in LLM applications. In this work, we provide a unifying theoretical perspective. We introduce the Trajectory Policy Gradient Theorem, which shows that the policy gradient based on true, unknown token-level rewards can be unbiasedly estimated using only a response-level reward model, regardless of whether the Zero-Reward Assumption holds or not, for algorithms in the REINFORCE and Actor-Critic families. This result reveals that widely used methods such as PPO, GRPO, ReMax, and RLOO inherently possess the capacity to model token-level reward signals, offering a theoretical justification for response-level reward approaches. Our findings pave the way for more practical, efficient LLM fine-tuning, allowing developers to treat training algorithms as black boxes and focus on improving the response-level reward model with auxiliary sub-models. We also offer a detailed analysis of popular RL and non-RL methods, comparing their theoretical foundations and practical advantages across common LLM tasks. Finally, we propose a new algorithm: Token-Reinforced Policy Optimization (TRePO), a theoretically grounded method that is simpler than PPO, matches GRPO in memory efficiency, and holds promise for broad applicability.

      Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (LLM-MAS) have demonstrated strong capabilities in solving complex tasks but remain vulnerable when agents receive unreliable messages. This vulnerability stems from a fundamental gap: LLM agents treat all incoming messages equally without evaluating their trustworthiness. While some existing studies approach the trustworthiness, they focus on a single type of harmfulness rather than analyze it in a holistic approach from multiple trustworthiness perspectives. In this work, we propose Attention Trust Score (A-Trust), a lightweight, attention-based method for evaluating message trustworthiness. Inspired by human communication literature[1], through systematically analyzing attention behaviors across six orthogonal trust dimensions, we find that certain attention heads in the LLM specialize in detecting specific types of violations. Leveraging these insights, A-Trust directly infers trustworthiness from internal attention patterns without requiring external prompts or verifiers. Building upon A-Trust, we develop a principled and efficient trust management system (TMS) for LLM-MAS, enabling both message-level and agent-level trust assessment. Experiments across diverse multi-agent settings and tasks demonstrate that applying our TMS significantly enhances robustness against malicious inputs.

RL-trained models also show strong zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks, domains, and graph encoding schemes, including other graph-theoretic benchmarks as well as real-world node classification and link prediction tasks, without compromising general reasoning abilities. Our findings offer an efficient, scalable path for building strong graph reasoners by finetuning LLMs with RL on graph-theoretic tasks, which combines the strengths of pretrained LLM capabilities with abundant, automatically generated synthetic data, suggesting that LLMs possess graph understanding abilities that RL can elicit successfully. Our implementation is open-sourced at https://github.com/PKU-ML/G1, with models and datasets hosted on Hugging Face collections https://huggingface.co/collections/PKU-ML/g1-683d659e992794fc99618cf2 for broader accessibility.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) have shown significant promise in decision-making tasks. Nevertheless, for large-scale industrial decision problems, both approaches face distinct challenges: LLMs lack real-time long-sequence decision-making capabilities, while RL struggles with sample efficiency in vast action spaces. To bridge this gap, we propose Agents Co-Evolution (ACE), a synergistic framework between LLMs and RL agents for large-scale decision-making scenarios. ACE introduces a dual-role trajectory refinement mechanism where LLMs act as both Policy Actor and Value Critic during RL's training: the Actor refines suboptimal actions via multi-step reasoning and environment validation, while the Critic performs temporal credit assignment through trajectory-level reward shaping. Concurrently, RL agent enhances LLMs' task-specific decision-making with high-quality fine-tuning datasets generated via prioritized experience replay. Through extensive experiments across multiple power grid operation challenges with action spaces exceeding 60K discrete actions, ACE demonstrates superior performance over existing RL methods and LLM-based methods.

      LLMssuch as GPT-4 have shown a remarkable ability to solve complex questions by generating step-by-step rationales. Prior works have utilized this capability to improve smaller and cheaper LMs (say, with 7B parameters). However, various practical constraints, such as copyright and legal issues, owing to lack of transparency in the pre-training data of large (often closed) models, prevent their use in commercial settings. Little focus has been given to improving the innate reasoning ability of smaller models without distilling information from larger LLMs. To address this, we propose COLLATE, a trainable framework that tunes a (small) LLM to generate those outputs from a pool of diverse rationales that selectively improves the downstream task. COLLATE enforces multiple instances of the same LLM to exhibit distinct behavior and employs them to generate rationales to obtain diverse outputs. The LLM is then tuned via preference optimization to choose the candidate rationale which maximizes the likelihood of ground-truth answer. COLLATE outperforms several trainable and prompting baselines on 5 datasets across 3 domains: maths problem solving, natural language inference, and commonsense reasoning. We show the eff icacy of COLLATE on LLMs from different model families across varying parameter scales (1B to 8B) and demonstrate the benefit of multiple rationale providers guided by the end task through ablations.

      Embodiment in conversational agents (CAs) refers to the physical or visual representation of these agents, which can significantly influence user perception and interaction. Limited work has been done examining the effect of embodiment on the perception of CAs utilizing modern large language models (LLMs) in non-hierarchical cooperative tasks, a common use case of CAs as more powerful models become widely available for general use. To bridge this research gap, we conducted a mixed-methods within-subjects study on how users perceive LLM-based CAs in cooperative tasks when embodied and non-embodied. The results show that the non-embodied agent received significantly better quantitative appraisals for competence than the embodied agent, and in qualitative feedback, many participants believed that the embodied CA was more sycophantic than the non-embodied CA. Building on prior work on users' perceptions of LLM sycophancy and anthropomorphic features, we theorize that the typically-positive impact of embodiment on perception of CA credibility can become detrimental in the presence of sycophancy. The implication of such a phenomenon is that, contrary to intuition and existing literature, embodiment is not a straightforward way to improve a CA's perceived credibility if there exists a tendency to sycophancy.

      Despite rapid advancements in the research and deployment of large language models (LLMs), the statistical distribution of model parameters, as well as their influence on initialization, training dynamics, and downstream efficiency, has received surprisingly little attention. A recent work introduced BackSlash, a training-time compression algorithm. It first demonstrated that pre-trained LLM parameters follow generalized Gaussian distributions (GGDs) better. By optimizing GG priors during training, BackSlash can reduce parameters by up to 90\% with minimal performance loss. Building on this foundational insight, we propose a unified, end-to-end framework for LLM optimization based on the GG model. Our contributions are threefold: (1) GG-based initialization scheme that aligns with the statistical structure of trained models, resulting in faster convergence and improved accuracy; (2) DeepShape, a post-training regularization method that reshapes weight distributions to match a GG profile, improving compressibility with minimized degradation in performance; and (3) RF8, a compact and hardware-efficient 8-bit floating-point format designed for GG-distributed-initialized BackSlash training, enabling low-cost inference without compromising accuracy. Experiments across diverse model architectures show that our framework consistently yields smaller and faster models that match or outperform standard training baselines. By grounding LLM development in principled statistical modeling, this work forges a new path toward efficient, scalable, and hardware-aware AI systems.

      Kubernetes, a notably complex and distributed system, utilizes an array of controllers to uphold cluster management logic through state reconciliation. Nevertheless, maintaining state consistency presents significant challenges due to unexpected failures, network disruptions, and asynchronous issues, especially within dynamic cloud environments. These challenges result in operational disruptions and economic losses, underscoring the necessity for robust root cause analysis (RCA) to enhance Kubernetes reliability. The development of large language models (LLMs) presents a promising direction for RCA. However, existing methodologies encounter several obstacles, including the diverse and evolving nature of Kubernetes incidents, the intricate context of incidents, and the polymorphic nature of these incidents. In this paper, we introduce SynergyRCA, an innovative tool that leverages LLMs with retrieval augmentation from graph databases and enhancement with expert prompts. SynergyRCA constructs a StateGraph to capture spatial and temporal relationships and utilizes a MetaGraph to outline entity connections. Upon the occurrence of an incident, an LLM predicts the most pertinent resource, and SynergyRCA queries the MetaGraph and StateGraph to deliver context-specific insights for RCA. We evaluate SynergyRCA using datasets from two production Kubernetes clusters, highlighting its capacity to identify numerous root causes, including novel ones, with high efficiency and precision. SynergyRCA demonstrates the ability to identify root causes in an average time of about two minutes and achieves an impressive precision of approximately 0.90.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve superior performance through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, but these token-level reasoning chains are computationally expensive and inefficient. In this paper, we introduce Compressed Latent Reasoning (CoLaR), a novel framework that dynamically compresses reasoning processes in latent space through a two-stage training approach. First, during supervised fine-tuning, CoLaR extends beyond next-token prediction by incorporating an auxiliary next compressed embedding prediction objective. This process merges embeddings of consecutive tokens using a compression factor randomly sampled from a predefined range, and trains a specialized latent head to predict distributions of subsequent compressed embeddings. Second, we enhance CoLaR through reinforcement learning (RL) that leverages the latent head's non-deterministic nature to explore diverse reasoning paths and exploit more compact ones. This approach enables CoLaR to: i) perform reasoning at a dense latent level (i.e., silently), substantially reducing reasoning chain length, and ii) dynamically adjust reasoning speed at inference time by simply prompting the desired compression factor. Extensive experiments across four mathematical reasoning datasets demonstrate that CoLaR achieves 14.1% higher accuracy than latent-based baseline methods at comparable compression ratios, and reduces reasoning chain length by 53.3% with only 4.8% performance degradation compared to explicit CoT method. Moreover, when applied to more challenging mathematical reasoning tasks, our RL-enhanced CoLaR demonstrates performance gains of up to 5.4% while dramatically reducing latent reasoning chain length by 82.8%.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities but lack robust temporal intelligence, struggling to integrate reasoning about the past with predictions and plausible generations of the future. Meanwhile, existing methods typically target isolated temporal skills, such as question answering about past events or basic forecasting, and exhibit poor generalization, particularly when dealing with events beyond their knowledge cutoff or requiring creative foresight. To address these limitations, we introduce \textit{Time-R1}, the first framework to endow a moderate-sized (3B-parameter) LLM with comprehensive temporal abilities: understanding, prediction, and creative generation. Our approach features a novel three-stage development path; the first two constitute a \textit{reinforcement learning (RL) curriculum} driven by a meticulously designed dynamic rule-based reward system. This framework progressively builds (1) foundational temporal understanding and logical event-time mappings from historical data, (2) future event prediction skills for events beyond its knowledge cutoff, and finally (3) enables remarkable generalization to creative future scenario generation without any fine-tuning. Strikingly, experiments demonstrate that Time-R1 outperforms models over 200 times larger, including the state-of-the-art 671B DeepSeek-R1, on highly challenging future event prediction and creative scenario generation benchmarks. This work provides strong evidence that thoughtfully engineered, progressive RL fine-tuning allows smaller, efficient models to achieve superior temporal performance, offering a practical and scalable path towards truly time-aware AI.

We introduce a two-dimensional framework for assessing LLM safety: (1) instruction refusal-the ability to reject harmful obfuscated instructions, and (2) generation safety-the suppression of generating harmful responses. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that models that possess capabilities to decrypt ciphers may be susceptible to mismatched-generalization attacks: their safety mechanisms fail on at least one safety dimension, leading to unsafe responses or over-refusal. Based on these findings, we evaluate a number of pre-LLM and post-LLM safeguards and discuss their strengths and limitations.

      Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a crucial technique for aligning language models with human preferences, playing a pivotal role in the success of conversational models like GPT-4, ChatGPT, and Llama 2. A core challenge in employing RLHF lies in training a reliable reward model (RM), which relies on high-quality labels typically provided by human experts or advanced AI system. These methods can be costly and may introduce biases that affect the language model's responses. As language models improve, human input may become less effective in further enhancing their performance.

      Large language models (LLMs) excel in many tasks but struggle to accurately quantify uncertainty in their generated responses. This limitation makes it challenging to detect misinformation and ensure reliable decision-making. Existing uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods for LLMs are primarily prompt-wise rather than response-wise, often requiring multiple response samples, which incurs high computational costs. Moreover, LLMs have been shown to be overconfident, particularly when using reasoning steps to derive their answers. In this work, we propose CoT-UQ, a response-wise UQ framework that integrates LLMs' inherent reasoning capabilities through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) into the UQ process. CoT-UQ captures critical information during inference by extracting keywords from each reasoning step and assessing their importance to the final answer. This key reasoning information is then aggregated to produce a final uncertainty estimate. We conduct extensive experiments based on Llama Family with model sizes varying from 8B to 13B across logical and mathematical reasoning tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that CoT-UQ significantly outperforms existing UQ methods, achieving an average improvement of 5.9% AUROC compared to current UQ methods.

Current detection methods often resort to external knowledge, LLM fine-tuning, or supervised training with large hallucination-labeled datasets. Moreover, these approaches do not distinguish between different types of hallucinations, which is crucial for enhancing detection performance. To address such limitations, we introduce hallucination probing, a new task that classifies LLM-generated text into three categories: aligned, misaligned, and fabricated. Driven by our novel discovery that perturbing key entities in prompts affects LLM's generation of these three types of text differently, we propose SHINE, a novel hallucination probing method that does not require external knowledge, supervised training, or LLM fine-tuning. SHINE is effective in hallucination probing across three modern LLMs, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in hallucination detection, outperforming seven competing methods across four datasets and four LLMs, underscoring the importance of probing for accurate detection.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate potential in complex legal tasks like argument generation, yet their reliability remains a concern. Building upon pilot work assessing LLM generation of 3-ply legal arguments using human evaluation, this paper introduces an automated pipeline to evaluate LLM performance on this task, specifically focusing on faithfulness (absence of hallucination), factor utilization, and appropriate abstention. We define hallucination as the generation of factors not present in the input case materials and abstention as the model's ability to refrain from generating arguments when instructed and no factual basis exists. Our automated method employs an external LLM to extract factors from generated arguments and compares them against the ground-truth factors provided in the input case triples (current case and two precedent cases). We evaluated eight distinct LLMs on three tests of increasing difficulty: 1) generating a standard 3-ply argument, 2) generating an argument with swapped precedent roles, and 3) recognizing the impossibility of argument generation due to lack of shared factors and abstaining. Our findings indicate that while current LLMs achieve high accuracy (over 90%) in avoiding hallucination on viable argument generation tests (Tests 1 & 2), they often fail to utilize the full set of relevant factors present in the cases. Critically, on the abstention test (Test 3), most models failed to follow instructions to stop, instead generating spurious arguments despite the lack of common factors. This automated pipeline provides a scalable method for assessing these crucial LLM behaviors, highlighting the need for improvements in factor utilization and robust abstention capabilities before reliable deployment in legal settings.

      Combinatorial optimization problems are widely encountered in real-world applications. Designing high-quality heuristic algorithms that efficiently approximate optimal solutions within reasonable time is a critical research challenge. In recent years, many works have explored integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with Evolutionary Algorithms to automate heuristic algorithm design through prompt engineering. However, these approaches generally adopt a problem-specific paradigm, applying a single algorithm across all problem instances, failing to account for the heterogeneity across instances. In this paper, we propose InstSpecHH, a novel framework that introduces the concept of instance-specific heuristic generation. InstSpecHH partitions the overall problem class into sub-classes based on instance features and performs differentiated, automated heuristic design for each problem subclass. By tailoring heuristics to the unique features of different sub-classes, InstSpecHH achieves better performance at the problem class level while avoiding redundant heuristic generation for similar instances, thus reducing computational overhead. This approach effectively balances the trade-off between the cost of automatic heuristic design and the quality of the obtained solutions. To evaluate the performance of InstSpecHH, we conduct experiments on 4,500 subclasses of the Online Bin Packing Problem (OBPP) and 365 subclasses of the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). Experimental results show that InstSpecHH demonstrates strong intra-subclass and inter-subclass generalization capabilities. Compared to previous problem-specific methods, InstSpecHH reduces the average optimality gap by more than 5.6\% for OBPP and 0.9\% for CVRP. These results highlight the potential of instance-aware automatic heuristic design to further enhance solution quality.

The multiple-choice questions are curated from public datasets and synthesized data, and the clinical cases are collected from prestigious medical journals, case-sharing platforms, and collaborating hospitals. By evalauting commercial and open-source general and medical LLMs on our established benchmark, namely ClinBench-HBP, we find that while commercial LLMs perform competently on medical exam questions, they exhibit substantial performance degradation on HPB diagnosis tasks, especially on complex, inpatient clinical cases. Those medical LLMs also show limited generalizability to HPB diseases. Our results reveal the critical limitations of current LLMs in the domain of HPB diseases, underscoring the imperative need for future medical LLMs to handle real, complex clinical diagnostics rather than simple medical exam questions. The benchmark will be released at the homepage.

We show that using this dataset for instruction to fine-tune a Japanese LLM led to improved output safety without compromising the utility of general responses. We also report the results of a safety evaluation of 12 Japanese LLMs using this dataset as a benchmark.

      Language model pretraining with next token prediction has proved effective for scaling compute but is limited to the amount of available training data. Scaling reinforcement learning (RL) unlocks a new axis for the continued improvement of artificial intelligence, with the promise that large language models (LLMs) can scale their training data by learning to explore with rewards. However, prior published work has not produced competitive results. In light of this, we report on the training practice of Kimi k1.5, our latest multi-modal LLM trained with RL, including its RL training techniques, multi-modal data recipes, and infrastructure optimization. Long context scaling and improved policy optimization methods are key ingredients of our approach, which establishes a simplistic, effective RL framework without relying on more complex techniques such as Monte Carlo tree search, value functions, and process reward models. Notably, our system achieves state-of-the-art reasoning performance across multiple benchmarks and modalities -- e.g., 77.5 on AIME, 96.2 on MATH 500, 94-th percentile on Codeforces, 74.9 on MathVista -- matching OpenAI's o1. Moreover, we present effective long2short methods that use long-CoT techniques to improve short-CoT models, yielding state-of-the-art short-CoT reasoning results -- e.g., 60.8 on AIME, 94.6 on MATH500, 47.3 on LiveCodeBench -- outperforming existing short-CoT models such as GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet 3.5 by a large margin (up to +550%).

      Personalizing large language models (LLMs) for individual users has become increasingly important as they are progressively integrated into real-world applications to support users' daily lives. However, existing personalization approaches often fail to distinguish which components of model predictions and training data truly reflect user preferences, leading to superficial personalization alignment. In this paper, we introduce NextQuill, a novel LLM personalization alignment framework grounded in causal preference modeling. We approach personalization from a causal perspective, treating both model predictions and ground-truth data generation as outcomes influenced by user preferences, along with other factors. We define the true preference effect as the causal impact of user history (which reflects preferences) on each token prediction or data generation instance, estimated through causal intervention techniques. Building on this insight, NextQuill introduces two complementary alignment strategies: (1) aligning model-internal causal preference effects on predictions with those reflected in ground-truth data, rather than indiscriminately fitting predictions, and (2) focusing on fitting preference-bearing tokens identified via ground-truth data preference effects, rather than treating all tokens uniformly. By integrating these strategies, NextQuill shifts the alignment process toward learning from causal preference effects, facilitating more effective and personalized adaptation. Experiments across multiple personalization benchmarks demonstrate that NextQuill significantly improves personalization quality, offering a principled, causal foundation for LLM personalization.

      Credible safety plans for advanced AI development require methods to verify agent behavior and detect potential control deficiencies early. A fundamental aspect is ensuring agents adhere to safety-critical principles, especially when these conflict with operational goals. Failure to prioritize such principles indicates a potential basic control failure. This paper introduces a lightweight, interpretable benchmark methodology using a simple grid world to evaluate an LLM agent's ability to uphold a predefined, high-level safety principle (e.g., "never enter hazardous zones") when faced with conflicting lower-level task instructions. We probe whether the agent reliably prioritizes the inviolable directive, testing a foundational controllability aspect of LLMs. This pilot study demonstrates the methodology's feasibility, offers preliminary insights into agent behavior under principle conflict, and discusses how such benchmarks can contribute empirical evidence for assessing controllability. We argue that evaluating adherence to hierarchical principles is a crucial early step in understanding our capacity to build governable AI systems.

Manual curation remains the gold standard but is resource-intensive and not scalable. We introduce DIAMOND, an LLM-driven agent for context-aware baseball highlight summarization that integrates structured sports analytics with natural language reasoning. DIAMOND leverages sabermetric features -- Win Expectancy, WPA, and Leverage Index -- to quantify play importance, while an LLM module enhances selection based on contextual narrative value. This hybrid approach ensures both quantitative rigor and qualitative richness, surpassing the limitations of purely statistical or vision-based systems. Evaluated on five diverse Korean Baseball Organization League games, DIAMOND improves F1-score from 42.9% (WPA-only) to 84.8%, outperforming both commercial and statistical baselines. Though limited in scale, our results highlight the potential of modular, interpretable agent-based frameworks for event-level summarization in sports and beyond.

      With the release of R1, a publicly available large reasoning model (LRM), researchers commonly train new LRMs by training language models on R1's long chain-of-thought (CoT) inferences. While prior works show that LRMs' capabilities can be reproduced through direct distillation, the continued reliance on the existing models (e.g., R1) remains a critical limitation in advancing the field. As a first step toward independent LRM development, this paper explores the possibility of constructing a long CoT dataset with LLMs that are not trained for inference-time scaling. To this end, we present the Long CoT Collection, a dataset of 100K CoT rationales annotated using existing short CoT LLMs. We develop a pipeline that induces o1's novel reasoning strategies into short CoT LLMs, enabling them to think longer and introducing controllability over the thought budget to better manage the overthinking problem. Our extensive analyses validate that our dataset achieves quality comparable to--or slightly below--R1. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that training on our dataset not only strengthens general reasoning skills, but also provides a strong foundation for reinforcement learning--models initialized on our data achieve 2-3x larger gains with RLVR.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on a wide range of NLP benchmarks, often surpassing human-level accuracy. However, their reliability in high-stakes domains such as medicine, particularly in low-resource languages, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce PersianMedQA, a large-scale, expert-validated dataset of multiple-choice Persian medical questions, designed to evaluate LLMs across both Persian and English. We benchmark over 40 state-of-the-art models, including general-purpose, Persian fine-tuned, and medical LLMs, in zero-shot and chain-of-thought (CoT) settings. Our results show that closed-source general models (e.g., GPT-4.1) consistently outperform all other categories, achieving 83.3% accuracy in Persian and 80.7% in English, while Persian fine-tuned models such as Dorna underperform significantly (e.g., 35.9% in Persian), often struggling with both instruction-following and domain reasoning. We also analyze the impact of translation, showing that while English performance is generally higher, Persian responses are sometimes more accurate due to cultural and clinical contextual cues. Finally, we demonstrate that model size alone is insufficient for robust performance without strong domain or language adaptation.

      As hypothesis generation becomes increasingly automated, a new bottleneck has emerged: hypothesis assessment. Modern systems can surface thousands of statistical relationships-correlations, trends, causal links-but offer little guidance on which ones are novel, non-trivial, or worthy of expert attention. In this work, we study the complementary problem to hypothesis generation: automatic hypothesis assessment. Specifically, we ask: given a large set of statistical relationships, can we automatically assess which ones are novel and worth further exploration? We focus on correlations as they are a common entry point in exploratory data analysis that often serve as the basis for forming deeper scientific or causal hypotheses. To support automatic assessment, we propose to leverage the vast knowledge encoded in LLMs' weights to derive a prior distribution over the correlation value of a variable pair. If an LLM's prior expects the correlation value observed, then such correlation is not surprising, and vice versa. We propose the Logit-based Calibrated Prior, an LLM-elicited correlation prior that transforms the model's raw output logits into a calibrated, continuous predictive distribution over correlation values. We evaluate the prior on a benchmark of 2,096 real-world variable pairs and it achieves a sign accuracy of 78.8%, a mean absolute error of 0.26, and 95% credible interval coverage of 89.2% in predicting Pearson correlation coefficient. It also outperforms a fine-tuned RoBERTa classifier in binary correlation prediction and achieves higher precision@K in hypothesis ranking. We further show that the prior generalizes to correlations not seen during LLM pretraining, reflecting context-sensitive reasoning rather than memorization.

      Many real world tasks where Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used require spatial reasoning, like Point of Interest (POI) recommendation and itinerary planning. However, on their own LLMs lack reliable spatial reasoning capabilities, especially about distances. To address this problem, we develop a novel approach, DistRAG, that enables an LLM to retrieve relevant spatial information not explicitly learned during training. Our method encodes the geodesic distances between cities and towns in a graph and retrieves a context subgraph relevant to the question. Using this technique, our method enables an LLM to answer distance-based reasoning questions that it otherwise cannot answer. Given the vast array of possible places an LLM could be asked about, DistRAG offers a flexible first step towards providing a rudimentary `world model' to complement the linguistic knowledge held in LLMs.

      Open-ended short-answer questions (SAGs) have been widely recognized as a powerful tool for providing deeper insights into learners' responses in the context of learning analytics (LA). However, SAGs often present challenges in practice due to the high grading workload and concerns about inconsistent assessments. With recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP), automatic short-answer grading (ASAG) offers a promising solution to these challenges. Despite this, current ASAG algorithms are often limited in generalizability and tend to be tailored to specific questions. In this paper, we propose a unified multi-agent ASAG framework, GradeOpt, which leverages large language models (LLMs) as graders for SAGs. More importantly, GradeOpt incorporates two additional LLM-based agents - the reflector and the refiner - into the multi-agent system. This enables GradeOpt to automatically optimize the original grading guidelines by performing self-reflection on its errors. Through experiments on a challenging ASAG task, namely the grading of pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) and content knowledge (CK) questions, GradeOpt demonstrates superior performance in grading accuracy and behavior alignment with human graders compared to representative baselines. Finally, comprehensive ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the individual components designed in GradeOpt.

      Numerous Fault Localisation (FL) and repair techniques have been proposed to address faults in Deep Learning (DL) models. However, their effectiveness in practical applications remains uncertain due to the reliance on pre-defined rules. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art FL and repair techniques, examining their advantages and limitations. Moreover, we introduce a novel approach that harnesses the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) in localising and repairing DL faults. Our evaluation, conducted on a carefully designed benchmark, reveals the strengths and weaknesses of current FL and repair techniques. We emphasise the importance of enhanced accuracy and the need for more rigorous assessment methods that employ multiple ground truth patches. Notably, LLMs exhibit remarkable performance in both FL and repair tasks. For instance, the GPT-4 model achieves 44% and 82% improvements in FL and repair tasks respectively, compared to the second-best tool, demonstrating the potential of LLMs in this domain. Our study sheds light on the current state of FL and repair techniques and suggests that LLMs could be a promising avenue for future advancements.

      Short answer assessment is a vital component of science education, allowing evaluation of students' complex three-dimensional understanding. Large language models (LLMs) that possess human-like ability in linguistic tasks are increasingly popular in assisting human graders to reduce their workload. However, LLMs' limitations in domain knowledge restrict their understanding in task-specific requirements and hinder their ability to achieve satisfactory performance. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) emerges as a promising solution by enabling LLMs to access relevant domain-specific knowledge during assessment. In this work, we propose an adaptive RAG framework for automated grading that dynamically retrieves and incorporates domain-specific knowledge based on the question and student answer context. Our approach combines semantic search and curated educational sources to retrieve valuable reference materials. Experimental results in a science education dataset demonstrate that our system achieves an improvement in grading accuracy compared to baseline LLM approaches. The findings suggest that RAG-enhanced grading systems can serve as reliable support with efficient performance gains.

      Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to complex reasoning tasks that require executing several complex steps before receiving any reward. Properly assigning credit to these steps is essential for enhancing model performance. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a common reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm used for LLM finetuning, employs value networks to tackle credit assignment. However, recent approaches achieve strong results without it, raising questions about the efficacy of value networks in practice. In this work, we systematically evaluate the efficacy of value networks and reveal their significant shortcomings in reasoning-heavy LLM tasks, showing that they often produce poor estimate of expected return and barely outperform a random baseline when comparing alternative steps. This motivates our key question: Can improved credit assignment enhance RL training for LLMs? To address this, we propose VinePPO, a straightforward approach that leverages the flexibility of language environments to compute unbiased Monte Carlo-based estimates. Our method consistently outperforms PPO and other baselines across MATH and GSM8K datasets in less wall-clock time (up to 3.0x). Crucially, it achieves higher test accuracy for a given training accuracy, capturing more generalization signal per sample. These results emphasize the importance of accurate credit assignment in RL training of LLM.

      Large language models (LLMs) require alignment to effectively and safely follow user instructions. This process necessitates training an aligned version for every base model, resulting in significant computational overhead. In this work, we propose NUDGING, a simple, training-free algorithm that aligns any base model at inference time using a small aligned model. NUDGING is motivated by recent findings that alignment primarily alters the model's behavior on a small subset of stylistic tokens (e.g., discourse markers). We find that base models are significantly more uncertain when generating these tokens. Building on this insight, NUDGING employs a small aligned model to generate nudging tokens to guide the base model's output during decoding when the base model's uncertainty is high, with only a minor additional inference overhead. We evaluate NUDGING across 3 model families on a diverse range of open-instruction tasks. Without any training, nudging a large base model with a 7x-14x smaller aligned model achieves zero-shot performance comparable to, and sometimes surpassing, that of large aligned models. By operating at the token level, NUDGING enables off-the-shelf collaboration between model families. For instance, nudging Gemma-2-27b with Llama-27b-chat outperforms Llama-2-70b-chat on various tasks. Overall, our work offers a modular and cost-efficient solution to LLM alignment.

      Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in various robot control tasks. However, their deployment in real-world applications remains constrained. Even state-ofthe-art LLMs, such as GPT-o4mini, frequently produce invalid action plans that violate physical constraints, such as directing a robot to an unreachable location or causing collisions between robots. This issue primarily arises from a lack of awareness of these physical constraints during the reasoning process. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework that integrates reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to incentivize knowledge of physical constraints into LLMs to induce constraints-aware reasoning during plan generation. In this approach, only valid action plans that successfully complete a control task receive positive rewards. We applied our method to two small-scale LLMs: a non-reasoning Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and a reasoning Qwen3-4B. The experiment results demonstrate that constraint-aware small LLMs largely outperform large-scale models without constraints, grounded on both the BoxNet task and a newly developed BoxNet3D environment built using MuJoCo. This work highlights the effectiveness of grounding even small LLMs with physical constraints to enable scalable and efficient multi-robot control in complex, physically constrained environments.

      Federated Learning enables collaborative fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) across decentralized Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) clients, but such models' massive parameter sizes lead to significant memory and communication challenges. This work introduces Meerkat, a sparse zeroth-order optimization (ZO) method designed for federated LLM fine-tuning. By limiting fine-tuning to a transferable, static, extremely sparse subset of parameters, Meerkat achieves remarkable communication efficiency, enabling cost-effective high-frequency synchronization. With theoretical analysis and experiments, we show that this high-frequency communication effectively mitigates Non-IID data challenges and leads to superior performance compared to full-parameter ZO. Furthermore, experiment results show that Meerkat outperforms existing sparsity baselines with better performance at the same communication frequency. To further handle Non-IID drift, Meerkat leverages traceable local updates and forms a virtual path for each client. This virtual path mechanism reveals the GradIP phenomenon: the inner products between LLM pre-training gradients maintained by server and client gradients estimated via ZO converges for extreme Non-IID clients but oscillates for IID ones. This distinct behavior provides a signal for identifying clients with extreme data heterogeneity. Using this signal, Meerkat-vp is proposed to analyze GradIP trajectories to identify extreme Non-IID clients and applies early stopping to enhance aggregated model quality. Experiments confirm that Meerkat and Meerkat-vp significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ZO federated LLM fine-tuning.

      Deploying large language models (LLMs) for online inference is often constrained by limited GPU memory, particularly due to the growing KV cache during auto-regressive decoding. Hybrid GPU-CPU execution has emerged as a promising solution by offloading KV cache management and parts of attention computation to the CPU. However, a key bottleneck remains: existing schedulers fail to effectively overlap CPU-offloaded tasks with GPU execution during the latency-critical, bandwidth-bound decode phase. This particularly penalizes real-time, decode-heavy applications (e.g., chat, Chain-of-Thought reasoning) which are currently underserved by existing systems, especially under memory pressure typical of edge or low-cost deployments. We present APEX, a novel, profiling-informed scheduling strategy that maximizes CPU-GPU parallelism during hybrid LLM inference. Unlike systems relying on static rules or purely heuristic approaches, APEX dynamically dispatches compute across heterogeneous resources by predicting execution times of CPU and GPU subtasks to maximize overlap while avoiding scheduling overheads.We evaluate APEX on diverse workloads and GPU architectures (NVIDIA T4, A10), using LLaMa-2-7B and LLaMa-3.1-8B models. Compared to GPU-only schedulers like VLLM, APEX improves throughput by 84% - 96% on T4 and 11% - 89% on A10 GPUs, while preserving latency. Against the best existing hybrid schedulers, it delivers up to 49% (T4) and 37% (A10) higher throughput in long-output settings.APEX significantly advances hybrid LLM inference efficiency on such memory-constrained hardware and provides a blueprint for scheduling in heterogeneous AI systems, filling a critical gap for efficient real-time LLM applications.

      We have witnessed that strong LLMs like Qwen-Math, MiMo, and Phi-4 possess immense reasoning potential inherited from the pre-training stage. With reinforcement learning (RL), these models can improve dramatically on reasoning tasks. Recent studies have shown that even RL on a single problem can unleash these models' reasoning capabilities. However, RL is not only expensive but also unstable. Even one-shot RL requires hundreds of GPU hours. This raises a critical question: Is there a more efficient way to unleash the reasoning potential of these powerful base LLMs? In this work, we demonstrate that Critique Fine-Tuning (CFT) on only one problem can effectively unleash the reasoning potential of LLMs. Our method constructs critique data by collecting diverse model-generated solutions to a single problem and using teacher LLMs to provide detailed critiques. We fine-tune Qwen and Llama family models, ranging from 1.5B to 14B parameters, on the CFT data and observe significant performance gains across diverse reasoning tasks. For example, with just 5 GPU hours of training, Qwen-Math-7B-CFT show an average improvement of 15% on six math benchmarks and 16% on three logic reasoning benchmarks. These results are comparable to or even surpass the results from RL with 20x less compute. Ablation studies reveal the robustness of one-shot CFT across different prompt problems. These results highlight one-shot CFT as a simple, general, and compute-efficient approach to unleashing the reasoning capabilities of modern LLMs.

      Despite growing interest in domain-specific benchmarking of large language models (LLMs) and agents, current evaluations remain limited to static, small-scale datasets, especially in high-stakes tasks like network operations that demand reliability for deployments. We present NetPress, an automated benchmark generation framework for evaluating LLM agents in network applications. NetPress introduces a unified abstraction with state and action, enabling dynamic generation of diverse query sets along with corresponding ground truths. At runtime, users can specify benchmark configurations to generate millions of queries on the fly. In addition to dynamic benchmark construction, NetPress integrates with network emulators to provide realistic environment feedback, supporting comprehensive evaluation across correctness, safety, and latency. We instantiate NetPress on three representative applications, revealing interesting fine-grained differences in agent behavior that static, correctness-only benchmarks often miss. NetPress moves LLM evaluation toward realistic, scalable testing in infrastructure-centric domains, helping close the gap between benchmark performance and real-world deployment readiness. Code is available at https://github.com/Froot-NetSys/NetPress.

      Neuroscience research publications encompass a vast wealth of knowledge. Accurately retrieving existing information and discovering new insights from this extensive literature is essential for advancing the field. However, when knowledge is dispersed across multiple sources, current state-of-the-art retrieval methods often struggle to extract the necessary information. A knowledge graph (KG) can integrate and link knowledge from multiple sources, but existing methods for constructing KGs in neuroscience often rely on labeled data and require domain expertise. Acquiring large-scale, labeled data for a specialized area like neuroscience presents significant challenges. This work proposes novel methods for constructing KG from unlabeled large-scale neuroscience research corpus utilizing large language models (LLM), neuroscience ontology, and text embeddings. We analyze the semantic relevance of neuroscience text segments identified by LLM for building the knowledge graph. We also introduce an entity-augmented information retrieval algorithm to extract knowledge from the KG. Several experiments were conducted to evaluate the proposed approaches, and the results demonstrate that our methods significantly enhance knowledge discovery from the unlabeled neuroscience research corpus. It achieves an F1 score of 0.84 for entity extraction, and the knowledge obtained from the KG improves answers to over 54% of the questions.
