      While large language models (LLMs) are driving the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, effectively and reliably training these large models remains one of the field's most significant challenges. To address this challenge, we propose POET, a novel reParameterized training algorithm that uses Orthogonal Equivalence Transformation to optimize neurons. Specifically, POET reparameterizes each neuron with two learnable orthogonal matrices and a fixed random weight matrix. Because of its provable preservation of spectral properties of weight matrices, POET can stably optimize the objective function with improved generalization. We further develop efficient approximations that make POET flexible and scalable for training large-scale neural networks. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and scalability of POET in training LLMs.

      Can LLMs accurately adjust their confidence when facing opposition? Building on previous studies measuring calibration on static fact-based question-answering tasks, we evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) in a dynamic, adversarial debate setting, uniquely combining two realistic factors: (a) a multi-turn format requiring models to update beliefs as new information emerges, and (b) a zero-sum structure to control for task-related uncertainty, since mutual high-confidence claims imply systematic overconfidence. We organized 60 three-round policy debates among ten state-of-the-art LLMs, with models privately rating their confidence (0-100) in winning after each round. We observed five concerning patterns: (1) Systematic overconfidence: models began debates with average initial confidence of 72.9% vs. a rational 50% baseline. (2) Confidence escalation: rather than reducing confidence as debates progressed, debaters increased their win probabilities, averaging 83% by the final round. (3) Mutual overestimation: in 61.7% of debates, both sides simultaneously claimed >=75% probability of victory, a logical impossibility. (4) Persistent self-debate bias: models debating identical copies increased confidence from 64.1% to 75.2%; even when explicitly informed their chance of winning was exactly 50%, confidence still rose (from 50.0% to 57.1%). (5) Misaligned private reasoning: models' private scratchpad thoughts sometimes differed from their public confidence ratings, raising concerns about faithfulness of chain-of-thought reasoning. These results suggest LLMs lack the ability to accurately self-assess or update their beliefs in dynamic, multi-turn tasks; a major concern as LLMs are now increasingly deployed without careful review in assistant and agentic roles.

      While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements in reasoning and agent-based problem-solving, current evaluation methodologies fail to adequately assess their capabilities: existing benchmarks either rely on closed-ended questions prone to saturation and memorization, or subjective comparisons that lack consistency and rigor. In this work, we introduce HeuriGym, an agentic framework designed for evaluating heuristic algorithms generated by LLMs for combinatorial optimization problems, characterized by clearly defined objectives and expansive solution spaces. HeuriGym empowers LLMs to propose heuristics, receive evaluative feedback via code execution, and iteratively refine their solutions. We evaluate nine state-of-the-art models on nine problems across domains such as computer systems, logistics, and biology, exposing persistent limitations in tool use, planning, and adaptive reasoning. To quantify performance, we propose the Quality-Yield Index (QYI), a metric that captures both solution pass rate and quality. Even top models like GPT-o4-mini-high and Gemini-2.5-Pro attain QYI scores of only 0.6, well below the expert baseline of 1. Our open-source benchmark aims to guide the development of LLMs toward more effective and realistic problem-solving in scientific and engineering domains.

      As the Large-Language-Model-driven (LLM-driven) Artificial Intelligence (AI) bots became popular, people realized their strong potential in Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD). However, bots relying wholly on LLMs are unreliable in their knowledge, and whether they can finally produce a correct outcome for the task is not guaranteed. The collaboration among these agents also remains a challenge, since the necessary information to convey is unclear, and the information transfer is by prompts: unreliable, and malicious knowledge is easy to inject. With the help of knowledge representation and reasoning tools such as Answer Set Programming (ASP), conversational agents can be built safely and reliably, and communication among the agents made more reliable as well. We propose a Manager-Customer-Service Dual-Agent paradigm, where ASP-driven bots share the same knowledge base and complete their assigned tasks independently. The agents communicate with each other through the knowledge base, ensuring consistency. The knowledge and information conveyed are encapsulated and invisible to the users, ensuring the security of information transmission. To illustrate the dual-agent conversational paradigm, we have constructed AutoManager, a collaboration system for managing the drive-through window of a fast-food restaurant such as Taco Bell in the US. In AutoManager, the customer service bot takes the customer's order while the manager bot manages the menu and food supply. We evaluated our AutoManager system and compared it with the real-world Taco Bell Drive-Thru AI Order Taker, and the results show that our method is more reliable.

      Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently demonstrated strong potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Particularly, the "Zero" reinforcement learning introduced by Deepseek-R1-Zero, enables direct RL training of base LLMs without relying on an intermediate supervised fine-tuning stage. Despite these advancements, current works for LLM reasoning mainly focus on mathematical and coding domains, largely due to data abundance and the ease of answer verification. This limits the applicability and generalization of such models to broader domains, where questions often have diverse answer representations, and data is more scarce. In this paper, we propose General-Reasoner, a novel training paradigm designed to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities across diverse domains. Our key contributions include: (1) constructing a large-scale, high-quality dataset of questions with verifiable answers curated by web crawling, covering a wide range of disciplines; and (2) developing a generative model-based answer verifier, which replaces traditional rule-based verification with the capability of chain-of-thought and context-awareness. We train a series of models and evaluate them on a wide range of datasets covering wide domains like physics, chemistry, finance, electronics etc. Our comprehensive evaluation across these 12 benchmarks (e.g. MMLU-Pro, GPQA, SuperGPQA, TheoremQA, BBEH and MATH AMC) demonstrates that General-Reasoner outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving robust and generalizable reasoning performance while maintaining superior effectiveness in mathematical reasoning tasks.

      While generalization over tasks from easy to hard is crucial to profile language models (LLMs), the datasets with fine-grained difficulty annotations for each problem across a broad range of complexity are still blank. Aiming to address this limitation, we present Easy2Hard-Bench, a consistently formatted collection of 6 benchmark datasets spanning various domains, such as mathematics and programming problems, chess puzzles, and reasoning questions. Each problem within these datasets is annotated with numerical difficulty scores. To systematically estimate problem difficulties, we collect abundant performance data on attempts to each problem by humans in the real world or LLMs on the prominent leaderboard. Leveraging the rich performance data, we apply well-established difficulty ranking systems, such as Item Response Theory (IRT) and Glicko-2 models, to uniformly assign numerical difficulty scores to problems. Moreover, datasets in Easy2Hard-Bench distinguish themselves from previous collections by a higher proportion of challenging problems. Through extensive experiments with six state-of-the-art LLMs, we provide a comprehensive analysis of their performance and generalization capabilities across varying levels of difficulty, with the aim of inspiring future research in LLM generalization.

      This paper introduces MiniCPM4, a highly efficient large language model (LLM) designed explicitly for end-side devices. We achieve this efficiency through systematic innovation in four key dimensions: model architecture, training data, training algorithms, and inference systems. Specifically, in terms of model architecture, we propose InfLLM v2, a trainable sparse attention mechanism that accelerates both prefilling and decoding phases for long-context processing. Regarding training data, we propose UltraClean, an efficient and accurate pre-training data filtering and generation strategy, and UltraChat v2, a comprehensive supervised fine-tuning dataset. These datasets enable satisfactory model performance to be achieved using just 8 trillion training tokens. Regarding training algorithms, we propose ModelTunnel v2 for efficient pre-training strategy search, and improve existing post-training methods by introducing chunk-wise rollout for load-balanced reinforcement learning and data-efficient tenary LLM, BitCPM. Regarding inference systems, we propose CPM.cu that integrates sparse attention, model quantization, and speculative sampling to achieve efficient prefilling and decoding. To meet diverse on-device requirements, MiniCPM4 is available in two versions, with 0.5B and 8B parameters, respectively. Sufficient evaluation results show that MiniCPM4 outperforms open-source models of similar size across multiple benchmarks, highlighting both its efficiency and effectiveness. Notably, MiniCPM4-8B demonstrates significant speed improvements over Qwen3-8B when processing long sequences. Through further adaptation, MiniCPM4 successfully powers diverse applications, including trustworthy survey generation and tool use with model context protocol, clearly showcasing its broad usability.

      Large language models (LLMs) increasingly demonstrate signs of conceptual understanding, yet much of their internal knowledge remains latent, loosely structured, and difficult to access or evaluate. We propose self-questioning as a lightweight and scalable strategy to improve LLMs' understanding, particularly in domains where success depends on fine-grained semantic distinctions. To evaluate this approach, we introduce a challenging new benchmark of 1.3 million post-2015 computer science patent pairs, characterized by dense technical jargon and strategically complex writing. The benchmark centers on a pairwise differentiation task: can a model distinguish between closely related but substantively different inventions? We show that compared to placebo scientific information, prompting LLMs to generate and answer their own questions - targeting the background knowledge required for the task - significantly improves performance. These self-generated questions and answers activate otherwise underutilized internal knowledge. Allowing LLMs to retrieve answers from external scientific texts further enhances performance, suggesting that model knowledge is compressed and lacks the full richness of the training data. We also find that chain-of-thought prompting and self-questioning converge, though self-questioning remains more effective for improving understanding of technical concepts. Notably, we uncover an asymmetry in prompting: smaller models often generate more fundamental, more open-ended, better-aligned questions for mid-sized models than large models do, revealing a new strategy for cross-model collaboration. Altogether, our findings establish self-questioning as both a practical mechanism for automatically improving LLM comprehension, especially in domains with sparse and underrepresented knowledge, and a diagnostic probe of how internal and external knowledge are organized.

      In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) is a frontier paradigm to solve Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems in the foundation model era. While ICRL capabilities have been demonstrated in transformers through task-specific training, the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) out-of-the-box remains largely unexplored. This paper investigates whether LLMs can generalize cross-domain to perform ICRL under the problem of Dueling Bandits (DB), a stateless preference-based RL setting. We find that the top-performing LLMs exhibit a notable zero-shot capacity for relative decision-making, which translates to low short-term weak regret across all DB environment instances by quickly including the best arm in duels. However, an optimality gap still exists between LLMs and classic DB algorithms in terms of strong regret. LLMs struggle to converge and consistently exploit even when explicitly prompted to do so, and are sensitive to prompt variations. To bridge this gap, we propose an agentic flow framework: LLM with Enhanced Algorithmic Dueling (LEAD), which integrates off-the-shelf DB algorithm support with LLM agents through fine-grained adaptive interplay. We show that LEAD has theoretical guarantees inherited from classic DB algorithms on both weak and strong regret. We validate its efficacy and robustness even with noisy and adversarial prompts. The design of such an agentic framework sheds light on how to enhance the trustworthiness of general-purpose LLMs generalized to in-context decision-making tasks.

      LLMs are bound to transform healthcare with advanced decision support and flexible chat assistants. However, LLMs are prone to generate inaccurate medical content. To ground LLMs in high-quality medical knowledge, LLMs have been equipped with external knowledge via RAG, where unstructured medical knowledge is split into small text chunks that can be selectively retrieved and integrated into the LLMs context. Yet, existing RAG pipelines rely on raw, unstructured medical text, which can be noisy, uncurated and difficult for LLMs to effectively leverage. Systematic approaches to organize medical knowledge to best surface it to LLMs are generally lacking. To address these challenges, we introduce MIRIAD, a large-scale, curated corpus of 5,821,948 medical QA pairs, each rephrased from and grounded in a passage from peer-reviewed medical literature using a semi-automated pipeline combining LLM generation, filtering, grounding, and human annotation. Unlike prior medical corpora, which rely on unstructured text, MIRIAD encapsulates web-scale medical knowledge in an operationalized query-response format, which enables more targeted retrieval. Experiments on challenging medical QA benchmarks show that augmenting LLMs with MIRIAD improves accuracy up to 6.7% compared to unstructured RAG baselines with the same source corpus and with the same amount of retrieved text. Moreover, MIRIAD improved the ability of LLMs to detect medical hallucinations by 22.5 to 37% (increase in F1 score). We further introduce MIRIAD-Atlas, an interactive map of MIRIAD spanning 56 medical disciplines, enabling clinical users to visually explore, search, and refine medical knowledge. MIRIAD promises to unlock a wealth of down-stream applications, including medical information retrievers, enhanced RAG applications, and knowledge-grounded chat interfaces, which ultimately enables more reliable LLM applications in healthcare.

      Large Language Model (LLM) unlearning aims to erase or suppress undesirable knowledge within the model, offering promise for controlling harmful or private information to prevent misuse. However, recent studies highlight its limited efficacy in real-world scenarios, hindering practical adoption. In this study, we identify a pervasive issue underlying many downstream failures: the effectiveness of existing unlearning methods heavily depends on the form of training samples and frequently fails to generalize to alternate expressions of the same knowledge. We formally characterize this problem as Form-Dependent Bias and systematically investigate its specific manifestation patterns across various downstream tasks. To quantify its prevalence and support future research, we introduce ORT, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of unlearning methods against variations in knowledge expression. Results reveal that Form-Dependent Bias is both widespread and severe among current techniques. We argue that LLM unlearning should be form-independent to address the endless forms of downstream tasks encountered in real-world security-critical scenarios. Towards this goal, we introduce Rank-one Concept Redirection (ROCR), a novel training-free method, as a promising solution path. ROCR performs unlearning by targeting the invariants in downstream tasks, specifically the activated dangerous concepts. It is capable of modifying model parameters within seconds to redirect the model's perception of a specific unlearning target concept to another harmless concept. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ROCR significantly improves unlearning effectiveness compared to traditional methods while generating highly natural outputs.

In modern AI systems, collaboration between autonomous agents and integration with external tools have become essential elements for building practical AI applications. A2A offers a standardized communication method that enables agents developed in heterogeneous environments to collaborate effectively, while MCP provides a structured I/O framework for agents to connect with external tools and resources. Prior studies have focused primarily on the features and applications of either A2A or MCP individually.

      Recent advancements in Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) have significantly impacted the alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs). The sensitivity of reinforcement learning algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) has led to new line work on Direct Policy Optimization (DPO), which treats RLHF in a supervised learning framework. The increased practical use of these RLHF methods warrants an analysis of their vulnerabilities. In this work, we investigate the vulnerabilities of DPO to poisoning attacks under different scenarios and compare the effectiveness of preference poisoning, a first of its kind. We comprehensively analyze DPO's vulnerabilities under different types of attacks, i.e., backdoor and non-backdoor attacks, and different poisoning methods across a wide array of language models, i.e., LLama 7B, Mistral 7B, and Gemma 7B. We find that unlike PPO-based methods, which, when it comes to backdoor attacks, require at least 4\% of the data to be poisoned to elicit harmful behavior, we exploit the true vulnerabilities of DPO more simply so we can poison the model with only as much as 0.5\% of the data. We further investigate the potential reasons behind the vulnerability and how well this vulnerability translates into backdoor vs non-backdoor attacks.

      Recent studies have shown that large language models (LLMs), especially smaller ones, often lack robustness in their reasoning. I.e., they tend to experience performance drops when faced with distribution shifts, such as changes to numerical or nominal variables, or insertions of distracting clauses. A possible strategy to address this involves generating synthetic data to further "instantiate" reasoning problems on potential variations. In contrast, our approach focuses on "abstracting" reasoning problems. This not only helps counteract distribution shifts but also facilitates the connection to symbolic tools for deriving solutions. We find that this abstraction process is better acquired through reinforcement learning (RL) than just supervised fine-tuning, which often fails to produce faithful abstractions. Our method, AbstraL -- which promotes abstract reasoning in LLMs using RL on granular abstraction data -- significantly mitigates performance degradation on recent GSM perturbation benchmarks.

      Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) represents a rich repository of ancient medical knowledge that continues to play an important role in modern healthcare. Due to the complexity and breadth of the TCM literature, the integration of AI technologies is critical for its modernization and broader accessibility. However, this integration poses considerable challenges, including the interpretation of obscure classical Chinese texts and the modeling of intricate semantic relationships among TCM concepts. In this paper, we develop OpenTCM, an LLM-based system that combines a domain-specific TCM knowledge graph and Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG). First, we extract more than 3.73 million classical Chinese characters from 68 gynecological books in the Chinese Medical Classics Database, with the help of TCM and gynecology experts. Second, we construct a comprehensive multi-relational knowledge graph comprising more than 48,000 entities and 152,000 interrelationships, using customized prompts and Chinese-oriented LLMs such as DeepSeek and Kimi to ensure high-fidelity semantic understanding. Last, we integrate OpenTCM with this knowledge graph, enabling high-fidelity ingredient knowledge retrieval and diagnostic question-answering without model fine-tuning. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that OpenTCM achieves mean expert scores (MES) of 4.378 in ingredient information retrieval and 4.045 in diagnostic question-answering tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions in real-world TCM use cases.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to exhibit vulnerabilities despite deliberate safety alignment efforts, posing significant risks to users and society. To safeguard against the risk of policy-violating content, system-level moderation via external guard models-designed to monitor LLM inputs and outputs and block potentially harmful content-has emerged as a prevalent mitigation strategy. Existing approaches of training guard models rely heavily on extensive human curated datasets and struggle with out-of-distribution threats, such as emerging harmful categories or jailbreak attacks. To address these limitations, we propose RSafe, an adaptive reasoning-based safeguard that conducts guided safety reasoning to provide robust protection within the scope of specified safety policies. RSafe operates in two stages: 1) guided reasoning, where it analyzes safety risks of input content through policy-guided step-by-step reasoning, and 2) reinforced alignment, where rule-based RL optimizes its reasoning paths to align with accurate safety prediction. This two-stage training paradigm enables RSafe to internalize safety principles to generalize safety protection capability over unseen or adversarial safety violation scenarios. During inference, RSafe accepts user-specified safety policies to provide enhanced safeguards tailored to specific safety requirements.

      Query rewrite transforms SQL queries into semantically equivalent forms that run more efficiently. Existing approaches mainly rely on predefined rewrite rules, but they handle a limited subset of queries and can cause performance regressions. This limitation stems from three challenges of rule-based query rewrite: (1) it is hard to discover and verify new rules, (2) fixed rewrite rules do not generalize to new query patterns, and (3) some rewrite techniques cannot be expressed as fixed rules. Motivated by the fact that human experts exhibit significantly better rewrite ability but suffer from scalability, and Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated nearly human-level semantic and reasoning abilities, we propose a new approach of using LLMs to rewrite SQL queries beyond rules. Due to the hallucination problems in LLMs, directly applying LLMs often leads to nonequivalent and suboptimal queries. To address this issue, we propose QUITE (query rewrite), a training-free and feedback-aware system based on LLM agents that rewrites SQL queries into semantically equivalent forms with significantly better performance, covering a broader range of query patterns and rewrite strategies compared to rule-based methods. Firstly, we design a multi-agent framework controlled by a finite state machine (FSM) to equip LLMs with the ability to use external tools and enhance the rewrite process with real-time database feedback. Secondly, we develop a rewrite middleware to enhance the ability of LLMs to generate optimized query equivalents. Finally, we employ a novel hint injection technique to improve execution plans for rewritten queries. Extensive experiments show that QUITE reduces query execution time by up to 35.8% over state-of-the-art approaches and produces 24.1% more rewrites than prior methods, covering query cases that earlier systems did not handle.

      Large language models (LLMs) have made significant advancements across various tasks, but their safety alignment remain a major concern. Exploring jailbreak prompts can expose LLMs' vulnerabilities and guide efforts to secure them. Existing methods primarily design sophisticated instructions for the LLM to follow, or rely on multiple iterations, which could hinder the performance and efficiency of jailbreaks. In this work, we propose a novel jailbreak paradigm, Simple Assistive Task Linkage (SATA), which can effectively circumvent LLM safeguards and elicit harmful responses. Specifically, SATA first masks harmful keywords within a malicious query to generate a relatively benign query containing one or multiple [MASK] special tokens. It then employs a simple assistive task such as a masked language model task or an element lookup by position task to encode the semantics of the masked keywords. Finally, SATA links the assistive task with the masked query to jointly perform the jailbreak. Extensive experiments show that SATA achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms baselines by a large margin. Specifically, on AdvBench dataset, with mask language model (MLM) assistive task, SATA achieves an overall attack success rate (ASR) of 85% and harmful score (HS) of 4.57, and with element lookup by position (ELP) assistive task, SATA attains an overall ASR of 76% and HS of 4.43.

      Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks in recent years. However, their susceptibility to jailbreaks and perturbations necessitates additional evaluations. Many LLMs are multilingual, but safety-related training data contains mainly high-resource languages like English. This can leave them vulnerable to perturbations in low-resource languages such as Polish. We show how surprisingly strong attacks can be cheaply created by altering just a few characters and using a small proxy model for word importance calculation. We find that these character and word-level attacks drastically alter the predictions of different LLMs, suggesting a potential vulnerability that can be used to circumvent their internal safety mechanisms. We validate our attack construction methodology on Polish, a low-resource language, and find potential vulnerabilities of LLMs in this language. Additionally, we show how it can be extended to other languages. We release the created datasets and code for further research.

      While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in assisting peer review, current methods often struggle to generate thorough and insightful reviews while maintaining efficiency. In this paper, we propose TreeReview, a novel framework that models paper review as a hierarchical and bidirectional question-answering process. TreeReview first constructs a tree of review questions by recursively decomposing high-level questions into fine-grained sub-questions and then resolves the question tree by iteratively aggregating answers from leaf to root to get the final review. Crucially, we incorporate a dynamic question expansion mechanism to enable deeper probing by generating follow-up questions when needed. We construct a benchmark derived from ICLR and NeurIPS venues to evaluate our method on full review generation and actionable feedback comments generation tasks. Experimental results of both LLM-based and human evaluation show that TreeReview outperforms strong baselines in providing comprehensive, in-depth, and expert-aligned review feedback, while reducing LLM token usage by up to 80% compared to computationally intensive approaches.

We created a parallel corpus of 9852 dialect-to-standard Ukrainian sentence pairs and a dictionary of 7320 dialectal word mappings. We also addressed data shortage by proposing an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to generate synthetic parallel translation pairs, expanding the corpus with 52142 examples. We have fine-tuned multiple open-source LLMs using LoRA and evaluated them on a standard-to-dialect translation task, also comparing with few-shot GPT-4o translation. In the absence of human annotators, we adopt a multi-metric evaluation strategy combining BLEU, chrF++, TER, and LLM-based judgment (GPT-4o). The results show that even small(7B) finetuned models outperform zero-shot baselines such as GPT-4o across both automatic and LLM-evaluated metrics.

      Machine learning is advancing rapidly, with applications bringing notable benefits, such as improvements in translation and code generation. Models like ChatGPT, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), are increasingly integrated into daily life. However, alongside these benefits, LLMs also introduce social risks. Malicious users can exploit LLMs by submitting harmful prompts, such as requesting instructions for illegal activities. To mitigate this, models often include a security mechanism that automatically rejects such harmful prompts. However, they can be bypassed through LLM jailbreaks. Current jailbreaks often require significant manual effort, high computational costs, or result in excessive model modifications that may degrade regular utility. We introduce TwinBreak, an innovative safety alignment removal method. Building on the idea that the safety mechanism operates like an embedded backdoor, TwinBreak identifies and prunes parameters responsible for this functionality. By focusing on the most relevant model layers, TwinBreak performs fine-grained analysis of parameters essential to model utility and safety. TwinBreak is the first method to analyze intermediate outputs from prompts with high structural and content similarity to isolate safety parameters. We present the TwinPrompt dataset containing 100 such twin prompts. Experiments confirm TwinBreak's effectiveness, achieving 89% to 98% success rates with minimal computational requirements across 16 LLMs from five vendors.

      Test smells indicate poor development practices in test code, reducing maintainability and reliability. While developers often struggle to prevent or refactor these issues, existing tools focus primarily on detection rather than automated refactoring. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in code understanding and transformation, but their ability to both identify and refactor test smells remains underexplored. We evaluated GPT-4-Turbo, LLaMA 3 70B, and Gemini-1.5 Pro on Python and Java test suites, using PyNose and TsDetect for initial smell detection, followed by LLM-driven refactoring. Gemini achieved the highest detection accuracy (74.35\% Python, 80.32\% Java), while LLaMA was lowest. All models could refactor smells, but effectiveness varied, sometimes introducing new smells. Gemini also improved test coverage, unlike GPT-4 and LLaMA, which often reduced it. These results highlight LLMs' potential for automated test smell refactoring, with Gemini as the strongest performer, though challenges remain across languages and smell types.

      Automatic indoor layout generation has attracted increasing attention due to its potential in interior design, virtual environment construction, and embodied AI. Existing methods fall into two categories: prompt-driven approaches that leverage proprietary LLM services (e.g., GPT APIs) and learning-based methods trained on layout data upon diffusion-based models. Prompt-driven methods often suffer from spatial inconsistency and high computational costs, while learning-based methods are typically constrained by coarse relational graphs and limited datasets, restricting their generalization to diverse room categories. In this paper, we revisit LLM-based indoor layout generation and present 3D-SynthPlace, a large-scale dataset that combines synthetic layouts generated via a 'GPT synthesize, Human inspect' pipeline, upgraded from the 3D-Front dataset. 3D-SynthPlace contains nearly 17,000 scenes, covering four common room types -- bedroom, living room, kitchen, and bathroom -- enriched with diverse objects and high-level spatial annotations. We further introduce OptiScene, a strong open-source LLM optimized for indoor layout generation, fine-tuned based on our 3D-SynthPlace dataset through our two-stage training. For the warum-up stage I, we adopt supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which is taught to first generate high-level spatial descriptions then conditionally predict concrete object placements. For the reinforcing stage II, to better align the generated layouts with human design preferences, we apply multi-turn direct preference optimization (DPO), which significantly improving layout quality and generation success rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OptiScene outperforms traditional prompt-driven and learning-based baselines. Moreover, OptiScene shows promising potential in interactive tasks such as scene editing and robot navigation.

      Driven by advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), integrating them into recommendation tasks has gained interest due to their strong semantic understanding and prompt flexibility. Prior work encoded user-item interactions or metadata into prompts for recommendations. In parallel, LLM reasoning, boosted by test-time scaling and reinforcement learning, has excelled in fields like mathematics and code, where reasoning traces and correctness signals are clear, enabling high performance and interpretability. However, directly applying these reasoning methods to recommendation is ineffective because user feedback is implicit and lacks reasoning supervision. To address this, we propose $\textbf{R2Rec}$, a reasoning-enhanced recommendation framework that samples interaction chains from the user-item graph and converts them into structured interaction-of-thoughts via a progressive masked prompting strategy, with each thought representing stepwise reasoning grounded in interaction context. This allows LLMs to simulate step-by-step decision-making based on implicit patterns. We design a two-stage training pipeline: supervised fine-tuning teaches basic reasoning from high-quality traces, and reinforcement learning refines reasoning via reward signals, alleviating sparse explicit supervision. Experiments on three real-world datasets show R2Rec outperforms classical and LLM-based baselines with an average $\textbf{10.48%}$ improvement in HitRatio@1 and $\textbf{131.81%}$ gain over the original LLM. Furthermore, the explicit reasoning chains enhance interpretability by revealing the decision process. Our code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/R2Rec-7C5D.

By redefining the Upper Confidence Bound scoring to align with intrinsic self-evaluation capabilities of LLMs and decomposing the inference process into atomic subtasks augmented with semantic clustering at each node, SELT effectively balances exploration and exploitation, reduces redundant reasoning paths, and mitigates hallucination. We validate our approach on challenging benchmarks, including the knowledge-based MMLU and the Tool Learning dataset Seal-Tools, where SELT achieves significant improvements in answer accuracy and reasoning robustness compared to baseline methods.

      One of the primary challenges in optimizing large language models (LLMs) for long-context inference lies in the high memory consumption of the Key-Value (KV) cache. Existing approaches, such as quantization, have demonstrated promising results in reducing memory usage. However, current quantization methods cannot take both effectiveness and efficiency into account. In this paper, we propose MoQAE, a novel mixed-precision quantization method via mixture of quantization-aware experts. First, we view different quantization bit-width configurations as experts and use the traditional mixture of experts (MoE) method to select the optimal configuration. To avoid the inefficiency caused by inputting tokens one by one into the router in the traditional MoE method, we input the tokens into the router chunk by chunk. Second, we design a lightweight router-only fine-tuning process to train MoQAE with a comprehensive loss to learn the trade-off between model accuracy and memory usage. Finally, we introduce a routing freezing (RF) and a routing sharing (RS) mechanism to further reduce the inference overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art KV cache quantization approaches in both efficiency and effectiveness.

      LLM agents are increasingly deployed to automate real-world tasks by invoking APIs through natural language instructions. While powerful, they often suffer from misinterpretation of user intent, leading to the agent's actions that diverge from the user's intended goal, especially as external toolkits evolve. Traditional software testing assumes structured inputs and thus falls short in handling the ambiguity of natural language. We introduce IntenTest, an API-centric stress testing framework that systematically uncovers intent integrity violations in LLM agents. Unlike prior work focused on fixed benchmarks or adversarial inputs, IntenTest generates realistic tasks based on toolkits' documentation and applies targeted mutations to expose subtle agent errors while preserving user intent. To guide testing, we propose semantic partitioning, which organizes natural language tasks into meaningful categories based on toolkit API parameters and their equivalence classes. Within each partition, seed tasks are mutated and ranked by a lightweight predictor that estimates the likelihood of triggering agent errors. To enhance efficiency, IntenTest maintains a datatype-aware strategy memory that retrieves and adapts effective mutation patterns from past cases. Experiments on 80 toolkit APIs demonstrate that IntenTest effectively uncovers intent integrity violations, significantly outperforming baselines in both error-exposing rate and query efficiency. Moreover, IntenTest generalizes well to stronger target models using smaller LLMs for test generation, and adapts to evolving APIs across domains.

We propose Token Internal Position Awareness (TIPA), a method that significantly improves models' ability to capture character positions within tokens by training them on reverse character prediction tasks using the tokenizer's vocabulary. Experiments demonstrate that TIPA enhances position prediction accuracy in LLMs, enabling more precise identification of target characters in original text. Furthermore, when applied to downstream tasks that do not require exact position prediction, TIPA still boosts performance in tasks needing character-level information, validating its versatility and effectiveness.

      GA LLM is a hybrid framework that combines Genetic Algorithms with Large Language Models to handle structured generation tasks under strict constraints. Each output, such as a plan or report, is treated as a gene, and evolutionary operations like selection, crossover, and mutation are guided by the language model to iteratively improve solutions. The language model provides domain knowledge and creative variation, while the genetic algorithm ensures structural integrity and global optimization. GA LLM has proven effective in tasks such as itinerary planning, academic outlining, and business reporting, consistently producing well structured and requirement satisfying results. Its modular design also makes it easy to adapt to new tasks. Compared to using a language model alone, GA LLM achieves better constraint satisfaction and higher quality solutions by combining the strengths of both components.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly assisting users in the real world, yet their reliability remains a concern. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) has been heralded as a tool to enhance human-LLM collaboration by enabling users to know when to trust LLM predictions. We argue that current practices for uncertainty quantification in LLMs are not optimal for developing useful UQ for human users making decisions in real-world tasks. Through an analysis of 40 LLM UQ methods, we identify three prevalent practices hindering the community's progress toward its goal of benefiting downstream users: 1) evaluating on benchmarks with low ecological validity; 2) considering only epistemic uncertainty; and 3) optimizing metrics that are not necessarily indicative of downstream utility. For each issue, we propose concrete user-centric practices and research directions that LLM UQ researchers should consider. Instead of hill-climbing on unrepresentative tasks using imperfect metrics, we argue that the community should adopt a more human-centered approach to LLM uncertainty quantification.

      Although large language models (LLMs) are highly interactive and extendable, current approaches to ensure reliability in deployments remain mostly limited to rejecting outputs with high uncertainty in order to avoid misinformation. This conservative strategy reflects the current lack of tools to systematically distinguish and respond to different sources of uncertainty. In this paper, we advocate for the adoption of Bayesian Modeling of Experiments -- a framework that provides a coherent foundation to reason about uncertainty and clarify the reducibility of uncertainty -- for managing and proactively addressing uncertainty that arises in LLM deployments. This framework enables LLMs and their users to take contextually appropriate steps, such as requesting clarification, retrieving external information, or refining inputs. By supporting active resolution rather than passive avoidance, it opens the door to more reliable, transparent, and broadly applicable LLM systems, particularly in high-stakes, real-world settings.

      Recent studies show that in supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models (LLMs), data quality matters more than quantity. While most data cleaning methods concentrate on filtering entire samples, the quality of individual tokens within a sample can vary significantly. After pre-training, even in high-quality samples, patterns or phrases that are not task-related can be redundant, uninformative, or even harmful. Continuing to fine-tune on these patterns may offer limited benefit and even degrade downstream task performance. In this paper, we investigate token quality from a noisy-label perspective and propose a generic token cleaning pipeline for SFT tasks. Our method filters out uninformative tokens while preserving those carrying key task-specific information. Specifically, we first evaluate token quality by examining the influence of model updates on each token, then apply a threshold-based separation. The token influence can be measured in a single pass with a fixed reference model or iteratively with self-evolving reference models. The benefits and limitations of both methods are analyzed theoretically by error upper bounds. Extensive experiments show that our framework consistently improves downstream performance.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong multilingual performance despite being predominantly trained on English-centric corpora. This raises a fundamental question: How do LLMs achieve such multilingual capabilities? Focusing on languages written in non-Roman scripts, we investigate the role of Romanization - the representation of non-Roman scripts using Roman characters - as a potential bridge in multilingual processing. Using mechanistic interpretability techniques, we analyze next-token generation and find that intermediate layers frequently represent target words in Romanized form before transitioning to native script, a phenomenon we term Latent Romanization. Further, through activation patching experiments, we demonstrate that LLMs encode semantic concepts similarly across native and Romanized scripts, suggesting a shared underlying representation. Additionally, for translation into non-Roman script languages, our findings reveal that when the target language is in Romanized form, its representations emerge earlier in the model's layers compared to native script. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of multilingual representation in LLMs and highlight the implicit role of Romanization in facilitating language transfer.

      The recent emergence of multimodal large language models (LLMs) has introduced new opportunities for improving visual hazard recognition on construction sites. Unlike traditional computer vision models that rely on domain-specific training and extensive datasets, modern LLMs can interpret and describe complex visual scenes using simple natural language prompts. However, despite growing interest in their applications, there has been limited investigation into how different LLMs perform in safety-critical visual tasks within the construction domain. To address this gap, this study conducts a comparative evaluation of five state-of-the-art LLMs: Claude-3 Opus, GPT-4.5, GPT-4o, GPT-o3, and Gemini 2.0 Pro, to assess their ability to identify potential hazards from real-world construction images. Each model was tested under three prompting strategies: zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought (CoT). Zero-shot prompting involved minimal instruction, few-shot incorporated basic safety context and a hazard source mnemonic, and CoT provided step-by-step reasoning examples to scaffold model thinking. Quantitative analysis was performed using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics across all conditions. Results reveal that prompting strategy significantly influenced performance, with CoT prompting consistently producing higher accuracy across models. Additionally, LLM performance varied under different conditions, with GPT-4.5 and GPT-o3 outperforming others in most settings. The findings also demonstrate the critical role of prompt design in enhancing the accuracy and consistency of multimodal LLMs for construction safety applications. This study offers actionable insights into the integration of prompt engineering and LLMs for practical hazard recognition, contributing to the development of more reliable AI-assisted safety systems.

We designed and conducted user studies where 498 African American English (AAE) speakers and 487 Queer slang speakers performed a set of question-answering tasks with LLM-based suggestions in either standard American English (SAE) or their self-identified sociolect. Our findings showed that sociolect usage by LLMs influenced both reliance and perceptions, though in some surprising ways. Results suggest that both AAE and Queer slang speakers relied more on the SAE agent, and had more positive perceptions of the SAE agent. Yet, only Queer slang speakers felt more social presence from the Queer slang agent over the SAE one, whereas only AAE speakers preferred and trusted the SAE agent over the AAE one. These findings emphasize the need to test for behavioral outcomes rather than simply assume that personalization would lead to a better and safer reliance outcome. They also highlight the nuanced dynamics of minoritized language in machine interactions, underscoring the need for LLMs to be carefully designed to respect cultural and linguistic boundaries while fostering genuine user engagement and trust.

      With the rapid development of multi-cloud environments, it is increasingly important to ensure the security and reliability of intelligent monitoring systems. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection and early warning mechanism for intelligent monitoring system in multi-cloud environment based on Large-Scale Language Model (LLM). On the basis of the existing monitoring framework, the proposed model innovatively introduces a multi-level feature extraction method, which combines the natural language processing ability of LLM with traditional machine learning methods to enhance the accuracy of anomaly detection and improve the real-time response efficiency. By introducing the contextual understanding capabilities of LLMs, the model dynamically adapts to different cloud service providers and environments, so as to more effectively detect abnormal patterns and predict potential failures. Experimental results show that the proposed model is significantly better than the traditional anomaly detection system in terms of detection accuracy and latency, and significantly improves the resilience and active management ability of cloud infrastructure.

      The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized various natural language processing tasks. However, the substantial size of LLMs presents significant challenges in training or fine-tuning. While parameter-efficient approaches such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) have gained popularity, they often compromise performance compared to full-rank fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose Outlier-weighed Layerwise Sampling (OWS), a new memory-efficient fine-tuning approach, inspired by the layerwise outlier distribution of LLMs. Unlike LoRA, which adds extra adapters to all layers, OWS strategically assigns higher sampling probabilities to layers with more outliers, selectively sampling only a few layers and fine-tuning their pre-trained weights. To further increase the number of fine-tuned layers without a proportional rise in memory costs, we incorporate gradient low-rank projection, further boosting the approach's performance. Our extensive experiments across various architectures, including LLaMa2 and Mistral, demonstrate that OWS consistently outperforms baseline approaches, including full fine-tuning. Specifically, it achieves up to a 1.1% average accuracy gain on the Commonsense Reasoning benchmark, a 3.0% improvement on MMLU, and a notable 10% boost on MT-Bench, while being more memory efficient. OWS allows us to fine-tune 7B LLMs with only 21GB of memory. Our code is available at https://github.com/pixeli99/OWS.

      Recent advancements in watermarking techniques have enabled the embedding of secret messages into AI-generated text (AIGT), serving as an important mechanism for AIGT detection. Existing methods typically interfere with the generation processes of large language models (LLMs) to embed signals within the generated text. However, these methods often rely on heuristic rules, which can result in suboptimal token selection and a subsequent decline in the quality of the generated content. In this paper, we introduce a plug-and-play contextual generation states-aware watermarking framework (CAW) that dynamically adjusts the embedding process. It can be seamlessly integrated with various existing watermarking methods to enhance generation quality. First, CAW incorporates a watermarking capacity evaluator, which can assess the impact of embedding messages at different token positions by analyzing the contextual generation states. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-branch pre-generation mechanism to avoid the latency caused by the proposed watermarking strategy. Building on this, CAW can dynamically adjust the watermarking process based on the evaluated watermark capacity of each token, thereby minimizing potential degradation in content quality. Extensive experiments conducted on datasets across multiple domains have verified the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating superior performance compared to various baselines in terms of both detection rate and generation quality.

      Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, raising concerns about their security. While jailbreak attacks highlight failures under overtly harmful queries, they overlook a critical risk: incorrectly answering harmless-looking inputs can be dangerous and cause real-world harm (Implicit Harm). We systematically reformulate the LLM risk landscape through a structured quadrant perspective based on output factuality and input harmlessness, uncovering an overlooked high-risk region. To investigate this gap, we propose JailFlipBench, a benchmark aims to capture implicit harm, spanning single-modal, multimodal, and factual extension scenarios with diverse evaluation metrics. We further develop initial JailFlip attack methodologies and conduct comprehensive evaluations across multiple open-source and black-box LLMs, show that implicit harm present immediate and urgent real-world risks, calling for broader LLM safety assessments and alignment beyond conventional jailbreak paradigms.

      Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate considerable proficiency in numerous coding-related tasks; however, their capabilities in detecting software vulnerabilities remain limited. This limitation primarily stems from two factors: (1) the absence of reasoning data related to vulnerabilities, which hinders the models' ability to capture underlying vulnerability patterns; and (2) their focus on learning semantic representations rather than the reason behind them, thus failing to recognize semantically similar vulnerability samples. Furthermore, the development of LLMs specialized in vulnerability detection is challenging, particularly in environments characterized by the scarcity of high-quality datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel framework ReVD that excels at mining vulnerability patterns through reasoning data synthesizing and vulnerability-specific preference optimization. Specifically, we construct forward and backward reasoning processes for vulnerability and corresponding fixed code, ensuring the synthesis of high-quality reasoning data. Moreover, we design the triplet supervised fine-tuning followed by curriculum online preference optimization for enabling ReVD to better understand vulnerability patterns. The extensive experiments conducted on PrimeVul and SVEN datasets demonstrate that ReVD sets new state-of-the-art for LLM-based software vulnerability detection, e.g., 12.24\%-22.77\% improvement in the accuracy.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong collaborative performance in multi-agent systems with predefined roles and workflows. However, in open-ended environments lacking coordination rules, agents tend to act in self-interested ways. The central challenge in achieving coordination lies in credit assignment -- fairly evaluating each agent's contribution and designing pricing mechanisms that align their heterogeneous goals. This problem is critical as LLMs increasingly participate in complex human-AI collaborations, where fair compensation and accountability rely on effective pricing mechanisms. Inspired by how human societies address similar coordination challenges (e.g., through temporary collaborations such as employment or subcontracting), we propose a cooperative workflow, Shapley-Coop. Shapley-Coop integrates Shapley Chain-of-Thought -- leveraging marginal contributions as a principled basis for pricing -- with structured negotiation protocols for effective price matching, enabling LLM agents to coordinate through rational task-time pricing and post-task reward redistribution. This approach aligns agent incentives, fosters cooperation, and maintains autonomy. We evaluate Shapley-Coop across two multi-agent games and a software engineering simulation, demonstrating that it consistently enhances LLM agent collaboration and facilitates equitable credit assignment. These results highlight the effectiveness of Shapley-Coop's pricing mechanisms in accurately reflecting individual contributions during task execution.

      Video large language models have not yet been widely deployed, largely due to their tendency to hallucinate. Typical benchmarks for Video-LLMs rely simply on multiple-choice questions. Unfortunately, VideoLLMs hallucinate far more aggressively on freeform text generation tasks like video captioning than they do on multiple choice verification tasks. To address this weakness, we propose ARGUS, a VideoLLM benchmark that measures freeform video captioning performance. By comparing VideoLLM outputs to human ground truth captions, ARGUS quantifies dual metrics. First, we measure the rate of hallucinations in the form of incorrect statements about video content or temporal relationships. Second, we measure the rate at which the model omits important descriptive details. Together, these dual metrics form a comprehensive view of video captioning performance.

      The remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has illuminated a promising pathway toward achieving Artificial General Intelligence for both academic and industrial communities, owing to their unprecedented performance across various applications. As LLMs continue to gain prominence in both research and commercial domains, their security and safety implications have become a growing concern, not only for researchers and corporations but also for every nation. Currently, existing surveys on LLM safety primarily focus on specific stages of the LLM lifecycle, e.g., deployment phase or fine-tuning phase, lacking a comprehensive understanding of the entire "lifechain" of LLMs. To address this gap, this paper introduces, for the first time, the concept of "full-stack" safety to systematically consider safety issues throughout the entire process of LLM training, deployment, and eventual commercialization. Compared to the off-the-shelf LLM safety surveys, our work demonstrates several distinctive advantages: (I) Comprehensive Perspective. We define the complete LLM lifecycle as encompassing data preparation, pre-training, post-training, deployment and final commercialization. To our knowledge, this represents the first safety survey to encompass the entire lifecycle of LLMs. (II) Extensive Literature Support. Our research is grounded in an exhaustive review of over 800+ papers, ensuring comprehensive coverage and systematic organization of security issues within a more holistic understanding. (III) Unique Insights. Through systematic literature analysis, we have developed reliable roadmaps and perspectives for each chapter. Our work identifies promising research directions, including safety in data generation, alignment techniques, model editing, and LLM-based agent systems. These insights provide valuable guidance for researchers pursuing future work in this field.

      Alpha mining, a critical component in quantitative investment, focuses on discovering predictive signals for future asset returns in increasingly complex financial markets. However, the pervasive issue of alpha decay, where factors lose their predictive power over time, poses a significant challenge for alpha mining. Traditional methods like genetic programming face rapid alpha decay from overfitting and complexity, while approaches driven by Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their promise, often rely too heavily on existing knowledge, creating homogeneous factors that worsen crowding and accelerate decay. To address this challenge, we propose AlphaAgent, an autonomous framework that effectively integrates LLM agents with ad hoc regularizations for mining decay-resistant alpha factors. AlphaAgent employs three key mechanisms: (i) originality enforcement through a similarity measure based on abstract syntax trees (ASTs) against existing alphas, (ii) hypothesis-factor alignment via LLM-evaluated semantic consistency between market hypotheses and generated factors, and (iii) complexity control via AST-based structural constraints, preventing over-engineered constructions that are prone to overfitting. These mechanisms collectively guide the alpha generation process to balance originality, financial rationale, and adaptability to evolving market conditions, mitigating the risk of alpha decay. Extensive evaluations show that AlphaAgent outperforms traditional and LLM-based methods in mitigating alpha decay across bull and bear markets, consistently delivering significant alpha in Chinese CSI 500 and US S&P 500 markets over the past four years. Notably, AlphaAgent showcases remarkable resistance to alpha decay, elevating the potential for yielding powerful factors.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in traditional natural language processing tasks but struggle with problems that require complex domain-specific calculations or simulations. While equipping LLMs with external tools to build LLM-based agents can enhance their capabilities, existing approaches lack the flexibility to address diverse and ever-evolving user queries in open domains. Currently, there is also no existing dataset that evaluates LLMs on open-domain knowledge that requires tools to solve. To this end, we introduce OpenAct benchmark to evaluate the open-domain task-solving capability, which is built on human expert consultation and repositories in GitHub.

In our experiments, even state-of-the-art LLMs and LLM-based agents demonstrate unsatisfactory success rates, underscoring the need for a novel approach. Furthermore, we present OpenAgent, a novel LLM-based agent system that can tackle evolving queries in open domains through autonomously integrating specialized tools from GitHub. OpenAgent employs 1) a hierarchical framework where specialized agents handle specific tasks and can assign tasks to inferior agents, 2) a bi-level experience learning mechanism to learn from both humans' and its own experiences to tackle tool flaws.

In this paper, we introduce Sparse Autoencoder Role-Playing Steering (SRPS), a novel framework that identifies and manipulates internal model features associated with role-playing behavior. Our approach extracts latent representations from role-play prompts, selects the most relevant features based on activation patterns, and constructs a steering vector that can be injected into the model's residual stream with controllable intensity. Our method enables fine-grained control over role-specific behavior and offers insights into how role information influences internal model activations. Extensive experiments across various reasoning benchmarks and model sizes demonstrate consistent performance gains. Notably, in the zero-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) setting, the accuracy of Llama3.1-8B on CSQA improves from 31.86% to 39.80%, while Gemma2-9B on SVAMP increases from 37.50% to 45.10%.

We systematically explore five progressively sophisticated transformer-based architectures: Sharanga (baseline transformer classifier), Mahendra (enhanced attention-weighted pooling with deeper heads), Vaishnava and Ashwina (hybrid neural ensemble architectures), and Raudra (an advanced multi-task framework with specialized loss functions). Our models are rigorously benchmarked across nine diverse adversarial datasets, including popular sets like the NotInject series, BIPIA, Garak, ImprovedLLM, ToxicChat, WildGuard, and our newly introduced JavelinBench, specifically crafted to test generalization on challenging borderline and hard-negative cases. Additionally, we compare our architectures against leading open-source guardrail models as well as large decoder-only LLMs such as gpt-4o, demonstrating superior cost-performance trade-offs in terms of accuracy, and latency. Our findings reveal that while Raudra's multi-task design offers the most robust performance overall, each architecture presents unique trade-offs in speed, interpretability, and resource requirements, guiding practitioners in selecting the optimal balance of complexity and efficiency for real-world LLM security applications.

      State-of-the-art automatic event detection struggles with interpretability and adaptability to evolving large-scale key events -- unlike episodic structures, which excel in these areas. Often overlooked, episodes represent cohesive clusters of core entities performing actions at a specific time and location; a partially ordered sequence of episodes can represent a key event. This paper introduces a novel task, episode detection, which identifies episodes within a news corpus of key event articles. Detecting episodes poses unique challenges, as they lack explicit temporal or locational markers and cannot be merged using semantic similarity alone. While large language models (LLMs) can aid with these reasoning difficulties, they suffer with long contexts typical of news corpora. To address these challenges, we introduce EpiMine, an unsupervised framework that identifies a key event's candidate episodes by leveraging natural episodic partitions in articles, estimated through shifts in discriminative term combinations. These candidate episodes are more cohesive and representative of true episodes, synergizing with LLMs to better interpret and refine them into final episodes. We apply EpiMine to our three diverse, real-world event datasets annotated at the episode level, where it achieves a 59.2% average gain across all metrics compared to baselines.

      The rapid adoption of generative AI models in domains such as education, policing, and social media raises significant concerns about potential bias and safety issues, particularly along protected attributes, such as race and gender, and when interacting with minors. Given the urgency of facilitating safe interactions with AI systems, we study bias along axes of race and gender in young girls. More specifically, we focus on "adultification bias," a phenomenon in which Black girls are presumed to be more defiant, sexually intimate, and culpable than their White peers. Advances in alignment techniques show promise towards mitigating biases but vary in their coverage and effectiveness across models and bias types. Therefore, we measure explicit and implicit adultification bias in widely used LLMs and text-to-image (T2I) models, such as OpenAI, Meta, and Stability AI models. We find that LLMs exhibit explicit and implicit adultification bias against Black girls, assigning them harsher, more sexualized consequences in comparison to their White peers. Additionally, we find that T2I models depict Black girls as older and wearing more revealing clothing than their White counterparts, illustrating how adultification bias persists across modalities. We make three key contributions: (1) we measure a new form of bias in generative AI models, (2) we systematically study adultification bias across modalities, and (3) our findings emphasize that current alignment methods are insufficient for comprehensively addressing bias. Therefore, new alignment methods that address biases such as adultification are needed to ensure safe and equitable AI deployment.

      We introduce the tokenized linear bandit (TLB) and multi-armed bandit (TMAB), variants of linear and stochastic multi-armed bandit problems inspired by LLM decoding and alignment. In these problems, at each round $t \in [T]$, a user submits a query (context), and the decision maker (DM) sequentially selects a token irrevocably from a token set. Once the sequence is complete, the DM observes a random utility from the user, whose expectation is presented by a sequence function mapping the chosen token sequence to a nonnegative real value that depends on the query. In both problems, we first show that learning is impossible without any structure on the sequence function. We introduce a natural assumption, diminishing distance with more commons (DDMC), and propose algorithms with regret $\tilde{O}(L\sqrt{T})$ and $\tilde{O}(L\sqrt{T^{2/3}})$ for TLB and TMAB, respectively. As a side product, we obtain an (almost) optimality of the greedy decoding for LLM decoding algorithm under DDMC, which justifies the unresaonable effectiveness of greedy decoding in several tasks. This also has an immediate application to decoding-time LLM alignment, when the misaligned utility can be represented as the frozen LLM's utility and a linearly realizable latent function. We finally validate our algorithm's performance empirically as well as verify our assumptions using synthetic and real-world datasets.

      This paper evaluates the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to leverage contextual information in the form of structured linguistic representations. Specifically, we examine the impact of encoding both short and long contexts using Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) structures across a diverse set of language tasks. We perform our analysis using 8-bit quantized and instruction-tuned versions of Llama 3.1 (8B), Phi-3, and Mistral 7B. Our results indicate that, for tasks involving short contexts, augmenting the prompt with the AMR of the original language context often degrades the performance of the underlying LLM. However, for tasks that involve long contexts, such as dialogue summarization in the SAMSum dataset, this enhancement improves LLM performance, for example, by increasing the zero-shot cosine similarity score of Llama 3.1 from 66.2% to 76%. This improvement is more evident in the newer and larger LLMs, but does not extend to the older or smaller ones. In addition, we observe that LLMs can effectively reconstruct the original text from a linearized AMR, achieving a cosine similarity of 81.3% in the best-case scenario.

      Code-switching presents a complex challenge for syntactic analysis, especially in low-resource language settings where annotated data is scarce. While recent work has explored the use of large language models (LLMs) for sequence-level tagging, few approaches systematically investigate how well these models capture syntactic structure in code-switched contexts. Moreover, existing parsers trained on monolingual treebanks often fail to generalize to multilingual and mixed-language input. To address this gap, we introduce the BiLingua Parser, an LLM-based annotation pipeline designed to produce Universal Dependencies (UD) annotations for code-switched text. First, we develop a prompt-based framework for Spanish-English and Spanish-Guaran\'i data, combining few-shot LLM prompting with expert review. Second, we release two annotated datasets, including the first Spanish-Guaran\'i UD-parsed corpus. Third, we conduct a detailed syntactic analysis of switch points across language pairs and communicative contexts. Experimental results show that BiLingua Parser achieves up to 95.29% LAS after expert revision, significantly outperforming prior baselines and multilingual parsers. These results show that LLMs, when carefully guided, can serve as practical tools for bootstrapping syntactic resources in under-resourced, code-switched environments.

      Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities in question answering and reasoning thanks to their extensive parametric memory. However, their knowledge is inherently limited by the scope of their pre-training data, while real-world information evolves continuously. Updating this knowledge typically requires costly and brittle re-training, or in-context learning (ICL), which becomes impractical at scale given the volume and volatility of modern information. Motivated by these limitations, we investigate how LLMs perform when exposed to temporal text corpora, or documents that reflect evolving knowledge over time, such as sports biographies where facts like a player's "current team" change year by year. To this end, we introduce two new benchmarks: Temporal Wiki, which captures factual drift across historical Wikipedia snapshots, and Unified Clark, which aggregates timestamped news articles to simulate real-world information accumulation. Our analysis reveals that LLMs often struggle to reconcile conflicting or outdated facts and can be misled when multiple versions of a fact appear in context. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight, agentic framework that incrementally builds a structured, external memory from source documents without requiring re-training. This knowledge organization strategy enables models to retrieve and reason over temporally filtered, relevant information at inference time. Empirically, our method outperforms ICL and RAG baselines across both benchmarks, especially on questions requiring more complex reasoning or integration of conflicting facts.

      The scaling of transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly expanded their context lengths, enabling applications where inputs exceed 100K tokens. Our analysis of a recent Azure LLM inference trace reveals a highly skewed long-tail distribution of input lengths, with approximately 80% of inputs shorter than 2K tokens. Long inputs constitute only a small fraction. Existing cluster-level LLM scheduling strategies, including First-In-First-Out (FIFO), reservation-based, and priority-based approaches, primarily target short-input requests with lengths below 2K and fail to address this heterogeneity, leading to inefficiencies such as head-of-line blocking, resource underutilization, and starvation of long-input requests. We propose PecSched, a Preemptive and Efficient Cluster SCHEDuling system for LLM inference. PecSched introduces the following key techniques: 1) preemptive scheduling that prioritizes short-input requests for their performance; 2) coordinated prefill-decode colocation and disaggregation, which reduces both the duration and frequency of preemptions; 3) fast Sequence Parallelism (SP) that minimizes the prefill time of long-input requests to further reduce the likelihood and frequency of preemptions. Evaluations based on Azure LLM inference trace show that, compared to state-of-the-art cluster-level LLM inference schedulers, PecSched reduces the 99th percentile queueing delay of short-input requests by up to 92% and improves their throughput by up to 595%, without significantly affecting the Job Completion Time (JCT) of long-input requests. We open-sourced our code.

      Equivalence checking of SQL queries is an intractable problem often encountered in settings ranging from grading SQL submissions to debugging query optimizers. Despite recent work toward developing practical solutions, only simple queries written using a small subset of SQL are supported, leaving the equivalence checking of sophisticated SQL queries at the mercy of intensive, potentially error-prone, manual analysis. In this paper, we explore how LLMs can be used to reason with SQL queries to address this challenging problem. Towards this, we introduce a novel, realistic, and sufficiently complex benchmark called SQLEquiQuest for SQL query equivalence checking that reflects real-world settings. We establish strong baselines for SQL equivalence checking by leveraging the ability of LLMs to reason with SQL queries. We conduct a detailed evaluation of several state-of-the-art LLMs using various prompting strategies and carefully constructed in-context learning examples, including logical plans generated by SQL query processors. Our empirical evaluation shows that LLMs go well beyond the current capabilities of formal models for SQL equivalence, going from a mere 30% supported query pairs to full coverage, achieving up to 82% accuracy on Spider+DIN. However, a critical limitation of LLMs revealed by our analysis is that they exhibit a strong bias for equivalence predictions, with consistently poor performance over non-equivalent pairs, opening a new direction for potential future research.

      Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced the capabilities of AI-Powered Search Engines (AIPSEs), offering precise and efficient responses by integrating external databases with pre-existing knowledge. However, we observe that these AIPSEs raise risks such as quoting malicious content or citing malicious websites, leading to harmful or unverified information dissemination. In this study, we conduct the first safety risk quantification on seven production AIPSEs by systematically defining the threat model, risk type, and evaluating responses to various query types. With data collected from PhishTank, ThreatBook, and LevelBlue, our findings reveal that AIPSEs frequently generate harmful content that contains malicious URLs even with benign queries (e.g., with benign keywords). We also observe that directly querying a URL will increase the number of main risk-inclusive responses, while querying with natural language will slightly mitigate such risk. Compared to traditional search engines, AIPSEs outperform in both utility and safety. We further perform two case studies on online document spoofing and phishing to show the ease of deceiving AIPSEs in the real-world setting. To mitigate these risks, we develop an agent-based defense with a GPT-4.1-based content refinement tool and a URL detector. Our evaluation shows that our defense can effectively reduce the risk, with only a minor cost of reducing available information by approximately 10.7%. Our research highlights the urgent need for robust safety measures in AIPSEs.

      Recently, techniques such as explicit structured reasoning have demonstrated strong test-time scaling behavior by enforcing a separation between the model's internal "thinking" process and the final response. A key factor influencing answer quality in this setting is the length of the thinking stage. When the reasoning is too short, the model may fail to capture the complexity of the task. Conversely, when it is too long, the model may overthink, leading to unnecessary computation and degraded performance. This paper explores and exploits the underlying mechanisms by which LLMs understand and regulate the length of their reasoning during explicit thought processes. First, we show that LLMs encode their progress through the reasoning process and introduce an interactive progress bar visualization, which is then used to reveal insights on the model's planning dynamics. Second, we manipulate the internal progress encoding during inference to reduce unnecessary steps and generate a more concise and decisive chain of thoughts. Our empirical results demonstrate that this "overclocking" method mitigates overthinking, improves answer accuracy, and reduces inference latency. Our code is publicly available.

      Large language models (LLMs) possess extensive knowledge bases and strong reasoning capabilities, making them promising tools for complex, multi-agent planning in embodied environments. However, despite LLMs' advanced abilities and the sophisticated modular design of agentic methods, existing LLM-based planning algorithms remain limited by weak adaptation capabilities to multi-agent embodied scenarios. We address this limitation by introducing a framework that enables LLM agents to learn and evolve both before and during test time, equipping them with environment-relevant knowledge for better planning and enhanced communication for improved cooperation. Inspired by centralized training with decentralized execution in multi-agent reinforcement learning, we propose a \textit{Learn as Individuals, Evolve as a Team (LIET)} paradigm for multi-agent LLMs adaptation. At the individual level, LLM agents learn a local utility function from exploratory datasets to better comprehend the embodied environment, which is then queried during test time to support informed decision-making. At the team level, LLM agents collaboratively and iteratively maintain and update a shared cooperation knowledge list based on new experiences, using it to guide more effective communication. By combining individual learning with team evolution, LIET enables comprehensive and flexible adaptation for LLM agents. Our experiments on Communicative Watch-And-Help and ThreeD-World Multi-Agent Transport benchmarks demonstrate that LIET, instantiated with both LLaMA and GPT-4o, outperforms existing baselines and exhibits strong cooperative planning abilities.

      In the realm of embodied intelligence, the evolution of large language models (LLMs) has markedly enhanced agent decision making. Consequently, researchers have begun exploring agent performance in dynamically changing high-risk scenarios, i.e., fire, flood, and wind scenarios in the HAZARD benchmark. Under these extreme conditions, the delay in decision making emerges as a crucial yet insufficiently studied issue. We propose a Time Conversion Mechanism (TCM) that translates inference delays in decision-making into equivalent simulation frames, thus aligning cognitive and physical costs under a single FPS-based metric. By extending HAZARD with Respond Latency (RL) and Latency-to-Action Ratio (LAR), we deliver a fully latency-aware evaluation protocol. Moreover, we present the Rapid-Reflex Async-Reflect Agent (RRARA), which couples a lightweight LLM-guided feedback module with a rule-based agent to enable immediate reactive behaviors and asynchronous reflective refinements in situ. Experiments on HAZARD show that RRARA substantially outperforms existing baselines in latency-sensitive scenarios.

This paper investigates the complex dynamics between LLMs and disinformation through a communication game that simulates online forums, inspired by the game Werewolf, with 25 participants. We analyse how Disinformers, Moderators, and Users leverage LLMs to advance their goals, revealing both the potential for misuse and combating disinformation. Our findings highlight the varying uses of LLMs depending on the participants' roles and strategies, underscoring the importance of understanding their effectiveness in this context. We conclude by discussing implications for future LLM development and online platform design, advocating for a balanced approach that empowers users and fosters trust while mitigating the risks of LLM-assisted disinformation.

      Learning reward models from human preference datasets and subsequently optimizing language models via reinforcement learning has emerged as a fundamental paradigm for aligning LLMs with human preferences. The performance of the reward model plays a crucial role in the effectiveness of alignment. Previous reward models operate at a coarse-grained level, requiring the generation of a complete response to obtain a reward value. The sparse reward may present challenges for downstream reinforcement learning. While recent efforts have attempted to learn token-level reward models, the lack of explicit semantic information makes it difficult to model the credit of every individual token. In this paper, we propose assigning scores to every sentence, introducing an intermediate-grained reward model. By segmenting the complete response into sentences and applying differential operations to reward output at the start and end positions of each sentence, we can effectively model the rewards of sentences. Moreover, a novel attention mechanism is introduced to aggregate the scores of all sentences into a response-level score, which allows it to be trained using the Bradley-Terry model. On common benchmarks, our method outperforms the response-level reward model by 2.7% on RewardBench (for reward modeling evaluation) and surpasses all baselines on AlpacaEval (for alignment evaluation).

      As video large language models (Video-LLMs) become increasingly integrated into real-world applications that demand grounded multimodal reasoning, ensuring their factual consistency and reliability is of critical importance. However, sycophancy, the tendency of these models to align with user input even when it contradicts the visual evidence, undermines their trustworthiness in such contexts. Current sycophancy research has largely overlooked its specific manifestations in the video-language domain, resulting in a notable absence of systematic benchmarks and targeted evaluations to understand how Video-LLMs respond under misleading user input. To fill this gap, we propose VISE (Video-LLM Sycophancy Benchmarking and Evaluation), the first dedicated benchmark designed to evaluate sycophantic behavior in state-of-the-art Video-LLMs across diverse question formats, prompt biases, and visual reasoning tasks. Specifically, VISE pioneeringly brings linguistic perspectives on sycophancy into the visual domain, enabling fine-grained analysis across multiple sycophancy types and interaction patterns. In addition, we explore key-frame selection as an interpretable, training-free mitigation strategy, which reveals potential paths for reducing sycophantic bias by strengthening visual grounding.

      One of the most widely used tasks for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA). While open-ended question answering tasks are more challenging to evaluate, MCQA tasks are, in principle, easier to assess, as the model's answer is thought to be simple to extract and is compared directly to a set of predefined choices. However, recent studies have started to question the reliability of MCQA evaluation, showing that multiple factors can significantly impact the reported performance of LLMs, especially when the model generates free-form text before selecting one of the answer choices. In this work, we shed light on the inconsistencies of MCQA evaluation strategies, which can lead to inaccurate and misleading model comparisons. We systematically analyze whether existing answer extraction methods are aligned with human judgment, and how they are influenced by answer constraints in the prompt across different domains. Our experiments demonstrate that traditional evaluation strategies often underestimate LLM capabilities, while LLM-based answer extractors are prone to systematic errors. Moreover, we reveal a fundamental trade-off between including format constraints in the prompt to simplify answer extraction and allowing models to generate free-form text to improve reasoning. Our findings call for standardized evaluation methodologies and highlight the need for more reliable and consistent MCQA evaluation practices.

      Long-document QA presents challenges with large-scale text and long-distance dependencies. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable entire documents to be processed in a single pass. However, their computational cost is significantly high. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods split text into smaller chunks, but they often yield inferior results and may lose global context. Recent approaches that integrate LLMs into RAG via iterative summarization either underutilize LLM capabilities or still incur high computational costs. In this paper, we combine the high accuracy of LLMs with the efficiency of RAG and propose LLM-Guided Dynamic Progress Control with Attention-Based Hierarchical Weighted Graph (PECAN). Our method introduces two key improvements: (1) LLM-Guided Dynamic Progress Control: We leverage LLMs to dynamically control the retrieval process, adjusting the amount of retrieved information based on different queries to achieve a better balance of effectiveness and efficiency. (2) Attention-Guided Retrieval: We propose a novel retrieval method that constructs a hierarchical graph where edges are derived by LLM attention weights. Experimental results demonstrate that PECAN achieves LLM-level performance while maintaining computational complexity comparable to that of RAG methods on two single-document and two multi-document QA datasets.

      Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, particularly in mathematical reasoning, amid which geometry problem solving remains a challenging area where auxiliary construction plays a enssential role. Existing approaches either achieve suboptimal performance or rely on massive LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o), incurring massive computational costs. We posit that reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (e.g., GRPO) offers a promising direction for training smaller models that effectively combine auxiliary construction with robust geometric reasoning. However, directly applying GRPO to geometric reasoning presents fundamental limitations due to its dependence on unconditional rewards, which leads to indiscriminate and counterproductive auxiliary constructions. To address these challenges, we propose Group Contrastive Policy Optimization (GCPO), a novel reinforcement learning framework featuring two key innovations: (1) Group Contrastive Masking, which adaptively provides positive or negative reward signals for auxiliary construction based on contextual utility, and a (2) length reward that promotes longer reasoning chains. Building on GCPO, we develop GeometryZero, a family of affordable-size geometric reasoning models that judiciously determine when to employ auxiliary construction. Our extensive empirical evaluation across popular geometric benchmarks (Geometry3K, MathVista) demonstrates that GeometryZero models consistently outperform baselines (e.g. GRPO), achieving an average improvement of 4.29% across all benchmarks.

      As quantum computing advances, quantum programming libraries' heterogeneity and steady evolution create new challenges for software developers. Frequent updates in software libraries break working code that needs to be refactored, thus adding complexity to an already complex landscape. These refactoring challenges are, in many cases, fundamentally different from those known in classical software engineering due to the nature of quantum computing software. This study addresses these challenges by developing a taxonomy of quantum circuit's refactoring problems, providing a structured framework to analyze and compare different refactoring approaches. Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven valuable tools for classic software development, yet their value in quantum software engineering remains unexplored. This study uses LLMs to categorize refactoring needs in migration scenarios between different Qiskit versions. Qiskit documentation and release notes were scrutinized to create an initial taxonomy of refactoring required for migrating between Qiskit releases. Two taxonomies were produced: one by expert developers and one by an LLM. These taxonomies were compared, analyzing differences and similarities, and were integrated into a unified taxonomy that reflects the findings of both methods. By systematically categorizing refactoring challenges in Qiskit, the unified taxonomy is a foundation for future research on AI-assisted migration while enabling a more rigorous evaluation of automated refactoring techniques. Additionally, this work contributes to quantum software engineering (QSE) by enhancing software development workflows, improving language compatibility, and promoting best practices in quantum programming.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on the transformer architecture and its self-attention mechanism to deliver strong performance across tasks. However, we uncover a structural inefficiency in standard pre-trained decoder-style LLMs: in many of the deeper layers, attention matrices frequently collapse to near rank-one, single-column patterns. We refer to these underutilized components as lazy layers, which are redundant and computationally inefficient. To address this, we propose Inheritune, a simple and effective training recipe for building smaller, more efficient, and high performing language models. Inheritune initializes a compact model by inheriting the useful early layers from a larger pre-trained model, then progressively retrains and expands it. Our experiments across multiple models and datasets show that Inheritune trained models, despite having significantly fewer layers, can match or even outperform their larger counterparts. This approach yields compact, performant models and offers a practical path for efficient language model compression. Code is available at https://github.com/sanyalsunny111/LLM-Inheritune

      Unit testing plays a critical role in ensuring software correctness. However, writing unit tests manually is laborious, especially for strong typed languages like Java, motivating the need for automated approaches. Traditional methods primarily rely on search-based or randomized algorithms to generate tests that achieve high code coverage and produce regression oracles, which are derived from the program's current behavior rather than its intended functionality. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled oracle generation from natural language descriptions. However, existing LLM-based methods often require LLM fine-tuning or rely on external tools such as EvoSuite for test prefix generation. In this work, we propose CANDOR, a novel end-to-end, prompt-based LLM framework for automated JUnit test generation. CANDOR orchestrates multiple specialized LLM agents to generate JUnit tests, including both high-quality test prefixes and accurate oracles. To mitigate the notorious hallucinations in LLMs, we introduce a novel strategy that engages multiple reasoning LLMs in a panel discussion and generate accurate oracles based on consensus. Additionally, to reduce the verbosity of reasoning LLMs' outputs, we propose a novel dual-LLM pipeline to produce concise and structured oracle evaluations. Our experiments on the HumanEvalJava and LeetCodeJava datasets show that CANDOR can generate accurate oracles and is slightly better than EvoSuite in generating tests with high line coverage and clearly superior in terms of mutation score. Moreover, CANDOR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art, prompt-based test generator LLM-Empirical, achieving improvements of 15.8 to 25.1 percentage points in oracle correctness on both correct and faulty source code. Ablation studies confirm the critical contributions of key agents in improving test prefix quality and oracle accuracy.

      Large language models (LLMs)-empowered web agents enables automating complex, real-time web navigation tasks in enterprise environments. However, existing web agents relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often struggle with generalization and robustness due to insufficient reasoning capabilities when handling the inherently dynamic nature of web interactions. In this study, we introduce WorkForceAgent-R1, an LLM-based web agent trained using a rule-based R1-style reinforcement learning framework designed explicitly to enhance single-step reasoning and planning for business-oriented web navigation tasks. We employ a structured reward function that evaluates both adherence to output formats and correctness of actions, enabling WorkForceAgent-R1 to implicitly learn robust intermediate reasoning without explicit annotations or extensive expert demonstrations. Extensive experiments on the WorkArena benchmark demonstrate that WorkForceAgent-R1 substantially outperforms SFT baselines by 10.26-16.59%, achieving competitive performance relative to proprietary LLM-based agents (gpt-4o) in workplace-oriented web navigation tasks.

      Selecting a sample generation scheme from multiple prompt-based generative models, including large language models (LLMs) and prompt-guided image and video generation models, is typically addressed by choosing the model that maximizes an averaged evaluation score. However, this score-based selection overlooks the possibility that different models achieve the best generation performance for different types of text prompts. An online identification of the best generation model for various input prompts can reduce the costs associated with querying sub-optimal models. In this work, we explore the possibility of varying rankings of text-based generative models for different text prompts and propose an online learning framework to predict the best data generation model for a given input prompt. The proposed PAK-UCB algorithm addresses a contextual bandit (CB) setting with shared context variables across the arms, utilizing the generated data to update kernel-based functions that predict the score of each model available for unseen text prompts. Additionally, we leverage random Fourier features (RFF) to accelerate the online learning process of PAK-UCB. Our numerical experiments on real and simulated text-to-image and image-to-text generative models show that RFF-UCB performs successfully in identifying the best generation model across different sample types.

      The evolution of cooperation has been extensively studied using abstract mathematical models and simulations. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLM) and the rise of LLM agents have demonstrated their ability to perform social reasoning, thus providing an opportunity to test the emergence of norms in more realistic agent-based simulations with human-like reasoning using natural language. In this research, we investigate whether the cooperation dynamics presented in Boyd and Richerson's model persist in a more realistic simulation of the diner's dilemma using LLM agents compared to the abstract mathematical nature in the work of Boyd and Richerson. Our findings indicate that agents follow the strategies defined in the Boyd and Richerson model, and explicit punishment mechanisms drive norm emergence, reinforcing cooperative behaviour even when the agent strategy configuration varies. Our results suggest that LLM-based Multi-Agent System simulations, in fact, can replicate the evolution of cooperation predicted by the traditional mathematical models. Moreover, our simulations extend beyond the mathematical models by integrating natural language-driven reasoning and a pairwise imitation method for strategy adoption, making them a more realistic testbed for cooperative behaviour in MASs.

      The translation of Low Dynamic Range (LDR) to High Dynamic Range (HDR) images is an important computer vision task. There is a significant amount of research utilizing both conventional non-learning methods and modern data-driven approaches, focusing on using both single-exposed and multi-exposed LDR for HDR image reconstruction. However, most current state-of-the-art methods require high-quality paired {LDR,HDR} datasets for model training. In addition, there is limited literature on using unpaired datasets for this task, that is, the model learns a mapping between domains, i.e., {LDR,HDR}. This paper proposes LLM-HDR, a method that integrates the perception of Large Language Models (LLM) into a modified semantic- and cycle-consistent adversarial architecture that utilizes unpaired {LDR,HDR} datasets for training. The method introduces novel artifact- and exposure-aware generators to address visual artifact removal and an encoder and loss to address semantic consistency, another under-explored topic. LLM-HDR is the first to use an LLM for the {LDR,HDR} translation task in a self-supervised setup. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance across several benchmark datasets and reconstructs high-quality HDR images.

      As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly participate in human-AI interactions, evaluating their Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities - particularly their ability to track dynamic mental states - becomes crucial. While existing benchmarks assess basic ToM abilities, they predominantly focus on static snapshots of mental states, overlooking the temporal evolution that characterizes real-world social interactions. We present \textsc{DynToM}, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to understand and track the temporal progression of mental states across interconnected scenarios. Through a systematic four-step framework, we generate 1,100 social contexts encompassing 5,500 scenarios and 78,100 questions, each validated for realism and quality. Our comprehensive evaluation of ten state-of-the-art LLMs reveals that their average performance underperforms humans by 44.7\%, with performance degrading significantly when tracking and reasoning about the shift of mental states. This performance gap highlights fundamental limitations in current LLMs' ability to model the dynamic nature of human mental states.

      The recent success of generative AI highlights the crucial role of high-quality human feedback in building trustworthy AI systems. However, the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) by crowdsourcing workers poses a significant challenge: datasets intended to reflect human input may be compromised by LLM-generated responses. Existing LLM detection approaches often rely on high-dimension training data such as text, making them unsuitable for annotation tasks like multiple-choice labeling. In this work, we investigate the potential of peer prediction -- a mechanism that evaluates the information within workers' responses without using ground truth -- to mitigate LLM-assisted cheating in crowdsourcing with a focus on annotation tasks. Our approach quantifies the correlations between worker answers while conditioning on (a subset of) LLM-generated labels available to the requester. Building on prior research, we propose a training-free scoring mechanism with theoretical guarantees under a crowdsourcing model that accounts for LLM collusion. We establish conditions under which our method is effective and empirically demonstrate its robustness in detecting low-effort cheating on real-world crowdsourcing datasets.

      As API access becomes a primary interface to large language models (LLMs), users often interact with black-box systems that offer little transparency into the deployed model. To reduce costs or maliciously alter model behaviors, API providers may discreetly serve quantized or fine-tuned variants, which can degrade performance and compromise safety. Detecting such substitutions is difficult, as users lack access to model weights and, in most cases, even output logits. To tackle this problem, we propose a rank-based uniformity test that can verify the behavioral equality of a black-box LLM to a locally deployed authentic model. Our method is accurate, query-efficient, and avoids detectable query patterns, making it robust to adversarial providers that reroute or mix responses upon the detection of testing attempts. We evaluate the approach across diverse threat scenarios, including quantization, harmful fine-tuning, jailbreak prompts, and full model substitution, showing that it consistently achieves superior statistical power over prior methods under constrained query budgets.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in tasks requiring complex reasoning, such as code generation, mathematical problem solving, and algorithmic synthesis -- especially when aided by reasoning tokens and Chain-of-Thought prompting. Yet, a core question remains: do these models truly reason, or do they merely exploit shallow statistical patterns? In this paper, we systematically investigate the robustness of reasoning LLMs by introducing a suite of semantically faithful yet adversarially structured prompt perturbations. Our evaluation -- spanning 700 perturbed code generations derived from LeetCode-style problems -- applies transformations such as storytelling reframing, irrelevant constraint injection, example reordering, and numeric perturbation. We observe that while certain modifications severely degrade performance (with accuracy drops up to -42.1%), others surprisingly improve model accuracy by up to 35.3%, suggesting sensitivity not only to semantics but also to surface-level prompt dynamics. These findings expose the fragility and unpredictability of current reasoning systems, underscoring the need for more principles approaches to reasoning alignments and prompting robustness. We release our perturbation datasets and evaluation framework to promote further research in trustworthy and resilient LLM reasoning.

A large body of research has explored the use of LLMs for various planning tasks, from web navigation to travel planning and database querying. However, many of these systems are tailored to specific problems, making it challenging to compare them or determine the best approach for new tasks. There is also a lack of clear and consistent evaluation criteria. Our survey aims to offer a comprehensive overview of current LLM planners to fill this gap. It builds on foundational work by Kartam and Wilkins (1990) and examines six key performance criteria: completeness, executability, optimality, representation, generalization, and efficiency. For each, we provide a thorough analysis of representative works and highlight their strengths and weaknesses. Our paper also identifies crucial future directions, making it a valuable resource for both practitioners and newcomers interested in leveraging LLM planning to support agentic workflows.

      Research into Video Large Language Models (LLMs) has progressed rapidly, with numerous models and benchmarks emerging in just a few years. Typically, these models are initialized with a pretrained text-only LLM and finetuned on both image- and video-caption datasets. In this paper, we present findings indicating that Video LLMs are more capable of temporal reasoning after image-only training than one would assume, and that improvements from video-specific training are surprisingly small. Specifically, we show that image-trained versions of two LLMs trained with the recent LongVU algorithm perform significantly above chance level on TVBench, a temporal reasoning benchmark. Additionally, we introduce a simple finetuning scheme involving sequences of annotated images and questions targeting temporal capabilities. This baseline results in temporal reasoning performance close to, and occasionally higher than, what is achieved by video-trained LLMs. This suggests suboptimal utilization of rich temporal features found in real video by current models. Our analysis motivates further research into the mechanisms that allow image-trained LLMs to perform temporal reasoning, as well as into the bottlenecks that render current video training schemes inefficient.

      While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success on a broad range of tasks, math reasoning remains a challenging one. One of the approaches for improving math reasoning is self-correction, which designs self-improving loops to let the model correct its own mistakes. However, existing self-correction approaches treat corrections as standalone post-generation refinements, relying on extra prompt and system designs to elicit self-corrections, instead of performing real-time, spontaneous self-corrections in a single pass. To address this, we propose SPOC, a spontaneous self-correction approach that enables LLMs to generate interleaved solutions and verifications in a single inference pass, with generation dynamically terminated based on verification outcomes, thereby effectively scaling inference time compute. SPOC considers a multi-agent perspective by assigning dual roles -- solution proposer and verifier -- to the same model. We adopt a simple yet effective approach to generate synthetic data for fine-tuning, enabling the model to develop capabilities for self-verification and multi-agent collaboration. We further improve its solution proposal and verification accuracy through online reinforcement learning. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that SPOC significantly improves performance. Notably, SPOC boosts the accuracy of Llama-3.1-8B and 70B Instruct models, achieving gains of 8.8% and 11.6% on MATH500, 10.0% and 20.0% on AMC23, and 3.3% and 6.7% on AIME24, respectively.

      The development of large language models (LLMs) has been instrumental in advancing state-of-the-art natural language processing applications. Training LLMs with billions of parameters and trillions of tokens require sophisticated distributed systems that enable composing and comparing several state-of-the-art techniques in order to efficiently scale across thousands of accelerators. However, existing solutions are complex, scattered across multiple libraries/repositories, lack interoperability, and are cumbersome to maintain. Thus, curating and empirically comparing training recipes require non-trivial engineering effort. This paper introduces TorchTitan, an open-source, PyTorch-native distributed training system that unifies state-of-the-art techniques, streamlining integration and reducing overhead. TorchTitan enables 3D parallelism in a modular manner with elastic scaling, providing comprehensive logging, checkpointing, and debugging tools for production-ready training. It also incorporates hardware-software co-designed solutions, leveraging features like Float8 training and SymmetricMemory. As a flexible test bed, TorchTitan facilitates custom recipe curation and comparison, allowing us to develop optimized training recipes for Llama 3.1 and provide guidance on selecting techniques for maximum efficiency based on our experiences. We thoroughly assess TorchTitan on the Llama 3.1 family of LLMs, spanning 8 billion to 405 billion parameters, and showcase its exceptional performance, modular composability, and elastic scalability. By stacking training optimizations, we demonstrate accelerations of 65.08% with 1D parallelism at the 128-GPU scale (Llama 3.1 8B), an additional 12.59% with 2D parallelism at the 256-GPU scale (Llama 3.1 70B), and an additional 30% with 3D parallelism at the 512-GPU scale (Llama 3.1 405B) on NVIDIA H100 GPUs over optimized baselines.

      Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in various tasks, including those requiring human-level intelligence, such as vulnerability detection. However, recent efforts to use LLMs for vulnerability detection remain preliminary, as they lack a deep understanding of whether a subject LLM's vulnerability reasoning capability stems from the model itself or from external aids such as knowledge retrieval and tooling support. In this paper, we aim to decouple LLMs' vulnerability reasoning from other capabilities, such as vulnerability knowledge adoption, context information retrieval, and advanced prompt schemes. We introduce LLM4Vuln, a unified evaluation framework that separates and assesses LLMs' vulnerability reasoning capabilities and examines improvements when combined with other enhancements. To support this evaluation, we construct UniVul, the first benchmark that provides retrievable knowledge and context-supplementable code across three representative programming languages: Solidity, Java, and C/C++. Using LLM4Vuln and UniVul, we test six representative LLMs (GPT-4.1, Phi-3, Llama-3, o4-mini, DeepSeek-R1, and QwQ-32B) for 147 ground-truth vulnerabilities and 147 non-vulnerable cases in 3,528 controlled scenarios.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit a notable performance ceiling on complex, multi-faceted tasks, as they often fail to integrate diverse information or adhere to multiple constraints. We posit that such limitation arises when the demands of a task exceed the LLM's effective cognitive load capacity. This interpretation draws a strong analogy to Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) in cognitive science, which explains similar performance boundaries in the human mind, and is further supported by emerging evidence that reveals LLMs have bounded working memory characteristics. Building upon this CLT-grounded understanding, we introduce CoThinker, a novel LLM-based multi-agent framework designed to mitigate cognitive overload and enhance collaborative problem-solving abilities. CoThinker operationalizes CLT principles by distributing intrinsic cognitive load through agent specialization and managing transactional load via structured communication and a collective working memory. We empirically validate CoThinker on complex problem-solving tasks and fabricated high cognitive load scenarios, demonstrating improvements over existing multi-agent baselines in solution quality and efficiency. Our analysis reveals characteristic interaction patterns, providing insights into the emergence of collective cognition and effective load management, thus offering a principled approach to overcoming LLM performance ceilings.

      Accurate identification of software vulnerabilities is crucial for system integrity. Vulnerability datasets, often derived from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) or directly from GitHub, are essential for training machine learning models to detect these security flaws. However, these datasets frequently suffer from significant noise, typically 40% to 75%, due primarily to the automatic and indiscriminate labeling of all changes in vulnerability-fixing commits (VFCs) as vulnerability-related. This misclassification occurs because not all changes in a commit aimed at fixing vulnerabilities pertain to security threats; many are routine updates like bug fixes or test improvements. This paper introduces the first methodology that uses the Large Language Model (LLM) with a heuristic enhancement to automatically identify vulnerability-fixing changes from VFCs, achieving an F1-score of 0.82. VulSifter was applied to a large-scale study, where we conducted a crawl of 127,063 repositories on GitHub, resulting in the acquisition of 5,352,105 commits. VulSifter involves utilizing an LLM to comprehend code semantics and contextual information, while applying heuristics to filter out unrelated changes. We then developed CleanVul, a high-quality dataset comprising 8,203 functions using our LLM heuristic enhancement approach, demonstrating Correctness (90.6%) comparable to established datasets such as SVEN and PrimeVul. To evaluate the CleanVul dataset, we conducted experiments focusing on fine-tuning various LLMs on CleanVul and other high-quality datasets. Evaluation results reveal that LLMs fine-tuned on CleanVul not only exhibit enhanced accuracy but also superior generalization capabilities compared to those trained on uncleaned datasets. Specifically, models trained on CleanVul and tested on PrimeVul achieve accuracy higher than those trained and tested exclusively on PrimeVul.

      This paper investigates the potentials of Large Language Models (LLMs) as adaptive tutors in the context of second-language learning. In particular, we evaluate whether system prompting can reliably constrain LLMs to generate only text appropriate to the student's competence level. We simulate full teacher-student dialogues in Spanish using instruction-tuned, open-source LLMs ranging in size from 7B to 12B parameters. Dialogues are generated by having an LLM alternate between tutor and student roles with separate chat histories. The output from the tutor model is then used to evaluate the effectiveness of CEFR-based prompting to control text difficulty across three proficiency levels (A1, B1, C1). Our findings suggest that while system prompting can be used to constrain model outputs, prompting alone is too brittle for sustained, long-term interactional contexts - a phenomenon we term alignment drift. Our results provide insights into the feasibility of LLMs for personalized, proficiency-aligned adaptive tutors and provide a scalable method for low-cost evaluation of model performance without human participants.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation, capable of tackling complex tasks during inference. However, the extent to which LLMs can be utilized for code checking or debugging through test case generation remains largely unexplored. We investigate this problem from the perspective of competition-level programming (CP) programs and propose TCGBench, a Benchmark for (LLM generation of) Test Case Generators. This benchmark comprises two tasks, aimed at studying the capabilities of LLMs in (1) generating valid test case generators for a given CP problem, and further (2) generating targeted test case generators that expose bugs in human-written code. Experimental results indicate that while state-of-the-art LLMs can generate valid test case generators in most cases, most LLMs struggle to generate targeted test cases that reveal flaws in human code effectively. Especially, even advanced reasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) fall significantly short of human performance in the task of generating targeted generators. Furthermore, we construct a high-quality, manually curated dataset of instructions for generating targeted generators. Analysis demonstrates that the performance of LLMs can be enhanced with the aid of this dataset, by both prompting and fine-tuning.

      We introduce a novel framework for simulating macroeconomic expectation formation using Large Language Model-Empowered Agents (LLM Agents). By constructing thousands of LLM Agents equipped with modules for personal characteristics, prior expectations, and knowledge, we replicate a survey experiment involving households and experts on inflation and unemployment. Our results show that although the expectations and thoughts generated by LLM Agents are more homogeneous than those of human participants, they still effectively capture key heterogeneity across agents and the underlying drivers of expectation formation. Furthermore, a module-ablation exercise highlights the critical role of prior expectations in simulating such heterogeneity. This approach complements traditional survey methods and offers new insights into AI behavioral science in macroeconomic research.

      Large Language Models (LLM), which have developed in recent years, enable credit risk assessment through the analysis of financial texts such as analyst reports and corporate disclosures. This paper presents the first systematic review and taxonomy focusing on LLMbased approaches in credit risk estimation. We determined the basic model architectures by selecting 60 relevant papers published between 2020-2025 with the PRISMA research strategy. And we examined the data used for scenarios such as credit default prediction and risk analysis. Since the main focus of the paper is interpretability, we classify concepts such as explainability mechanisms, chain of thought prompts and natural language justifications for LLM-based credit models. The taxonomy organizes the literature under four main headings: model architectures, data types, explainability mechanisms and application areas. Based on this analysis, we highlight the main future trends and research gaps for LLM-based credit scoring systems. This paper aims to be a reference paper for artificial intelligence and financial researchers.

      Implicit content plays a crucial role in political discourse, where speakers systematically employ pragmatic strategies such as implicatures and presuppositions to influence their audiences. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in tasks requiring complex semantic and pragmatic understanding, highlighting their potential for detecting and explaining the meaning of implicit content. However, their ability to do this within political discourse remains largely underexplored. Leveraging, for the first time, the large IMPAQTS corpus, which comprises Italian political speeches with the annotation of manipulative implicit content, we propose methods to test the effectiveness of LLMs in this challenging problem. Through a multiple-choice task and an open-ended generation task, we demonstrate that all tested models struggle to interpret presuppositions and implicatures. We conclude that current LLMs lack the key pragmatic capabilities necessary for accurately interpreting highly implicit language, such as that found in political discourse. At the same time, we highlight promising trends and future directions for enhancing model performance. We release our data and code at https://github.com/WalterPaci/IMPAQTS-PID

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed to automatically refactor unit tests, aiming to enhance readability, naming, and structural clarity while preserving functional behavior. However, evaluating such refactorings remains challenging: traditional metrics like CodeBLEU are overly sensitive to renaming and structural edits, whereas embedding-based similarities capture semantics but ignore readability and modularity. We introduce CTSES, a composite metric that integrates CodeBLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE-L to balance behavior preservation, lexical quality, and structural alignment. CTSES is evaluated on over 5,000 test suites automatically refactored by GPT-4o and Mistral-Large-2407, using Chain-of-Thought prompting, across two established Java benchmarks: Defects4J and SF110. Our results show that CTSES yields more faithful and interpretable assessments, better aligned with developer expectations and human intuition than existing metrics.
