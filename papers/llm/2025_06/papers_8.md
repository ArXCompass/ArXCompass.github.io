      The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a dual challenge in the fight against disinformation. These powerful tools, capable of generating human-like text at scale, can be weaponised to produce sophisticated and persuasive disinformation, yet they also hold promise for enhancing detection and mitigation strategies. This paper investigates the complex dynamics between LLMs and disinformation through a communication game that simulates online forums, inspired by the game Werewolf, with 25 participants. We analyse how Disinformers, Moderators, and Users leverage LLMs to advance their goals, revealing both the potential for misuse and combating disinformation. Our findings highlight the varying uses of LLMs depending on the participants' roles and strategies, underscoring the importance of understanding their effectiveness in this context. We conclude by discussing implications for future LLM development and online platform design, advocating for a balanced approach that empowers users and fosters trust while mitigating the risks of LLM-assisted disinformation.

      Learning reward models from human preference datasets and subsequently optimizing language models via reinforcement learning has emerged as a fundamental paradigm for aligning LLMs with human preferences. The performance of the reward model plays a crucial role in the effectiveness of alignment. Previous reward models operate at a coarse-grained level, requiring the generation of a complete response to obtain a reward value. The sparse reward may present challenges for downstream reinforcement learning. While recent efforts have attempted to learn token-level reward models, the lack of explicit semantic information makes it difficult to model the credit of every individual token. In this paper, we propose assigning scores to every sentence, introducing an intermediate-grained reward model. By segmenting the complete response into sentences and applying differential operations to reward output at the start and end positions of each sentence, we can effectively model the rewards of sentences. Moreover, a novel attention mechanism is introduced to aggregate the scores of all sentences into a response-level score, which allows it to be trained using the Bradley-Terry model. On common benchmarks, our method outperforms the response-level reward model by 2.7% on RewardBench (for reward modeling evaluation) and surpasses all baselines on AlpacaEval (for alignment evaluation).

      As video large language models (Video-LLMs) become increasingly integrated into real-world applications that demand grounded multimodal reasoning, ensuring their factual consistency and reliability is of critical importance. However, sycophancy, the tendency of these models to align with user input even when it contradicts the visual evidence, undermines their trustworthiness in such contexts. Current sycophancy research has largely overlooked its specific manifestations in the video-language domain, resulting in a notable absence of systematic benchmarks and targeted evaluations to understand how Video-LLMs respond under misleading user input. To fill this gap, we propose VISE (Video-LLM Sycophancy Benchmarking and Evaluation), the first dedicated benchmark designed to evaluate sycophantic behavior in state-of-the-art Video-LLMs across diverse question formats, prompt biases, and visual reasoning tasks. Specifically, VISE pioneeringly brings linguistic perspectives on sycophancy into the visual domain, enabling fine-grained analysis across multiple sycophancy types and interaction patterns. In addition, we explore key-frame selection as an interpretable, training-free mitigation strategy, which reveals potential paths for reducing sycophantic bias by strengthening visual grounding.

      One of the most widely used tasks for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA). While open-ended question answering tasks are more challenging to evaluate, MCQA tasks are, in principle, easier to assess, as the model's answer is thought to be simple to extract and is compared directly to a set of predefined choices. However, recent studies have started to question the reliability of MCQA evaluation, showing that multiple factors can significantly impact the reported performance of LLMs, especially when the model generates free-form text before selecting one of the answer choices. In this work, we shed light on the inconsistencies of MCQA evaluation strategies, which can lead to inaccurate and misleading model comparisons. We systematically analyze whether existing answer extraction methods are aligned with human judgment, and how they are influenced by answer constraints in the prompt across different domains. Our experiments demonstrate that traditional evaluation strategies often underestimate LLM capabilities, while LLM-based answer extractors are prone to systematic errors. Moreover, we reveal a fundamental trade-off between including format constraints in the prompt to simplify answer extraction and allowing models to generate free-form text to improve reasoning. Our findings call for standardized evaluation methodologies and highlight the need for more reliable and consistent MCQA evaluation practices.

      Long-document QA presents challenges with large-scale text and long-distance dependencies. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable entire documents to be processed in a single pass. However, their computational cost is significantly high. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods split text into smaller chunks, but they often yield inferior results and may lose global context. Recent approaches that integrate LLMs into RAG via iterative summarization either underutilize LLM capabilities or still incur high computational costs. In this paper, we combine the high accuracy of LLMs with the efficiency of RAG and propose LLM-Guided Dynamic Progress Control with Attention-Based Hierarchical Weighted Graph (PECAN). Our method introduces two key improvements: (1) LLM-Guided Dynamic Progress Control: We leverage LLMs to dynamically control the retrieval process, adjusting the amount of retrieved information based on different queries to achieve a better balance of effectiveness and efficiency. (2) Attention-Guided Retrieval: We propose a novel retrieval method that constructs a hierarchical graph where edges are derived by LLM attention weights. Experimental results demonstrate that PECAN achieves LLM-level performance while maintaining computational complexity comparable to that of RAG methods on two single-document and two multi-document QA datasets.

      Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, particularly in mathematical reasoning, amid which geometry problem solving remains a challenging area where auxiliary construction plays a enssential role. Existing approaches either achieve suboptimal performance or rely on massive LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o), incurring massive computational costs. We posit that reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (e.g., GRPO) offers a promising direction for training smaller models that effectively combine auxiliary construction with robust geometric reasoning. However, directly applying GRPO to geometric reasoning presents fundamental limitations due to its dependence on unconditional rewards, which leads to indiscriminate and counterproductive auxiliary constructions. To address these challenges, we propose Group Contrastive Policy Optimization (GCPO), a novel reinforcement learning framework featuring two key innovations: (1) Group Contrastive Masking, which adaptively provides positive or negative reward signals for auxiliary construction based on contextual utility, and a (2) length reward that promotes longer reasoning chains. Building on GCPO, we develop GeometryZero, a family of affordable-size geometric reasoning models that judiciously determine when to employ auxiliary construction. Our extensive empirical evaluation across popular geometric benchmarks (Geometry3K, MathVista) demonstrates that GeometryZero models consistently outperform baselines (e.g. GRPO), achieving an average improvement of 4.29% across all benchmarks.

      As quantum computing advances, quantum programming libraries' heterogeneity and steady evolution create new challenges for software developers. Frequent updates in software libraries break working code that needs to be refactored, thus adding complexity to an already complex landscape. These refactoring challenges are, in many cases, fundamentally different from those known in classical software engineering due to the nature of quantum computing software. This study addresses these challenges by developing a taxonomy of quantum circuit's refactoring problems, providing a structured framework to analyze and compare different refactoring approaches. Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven valuable tools for classic software development, yet their value in quantum software engineering remains unexplored. This study uses LLMs to categorize refactoring needs in migration scenarios between different Qiskit versions. Qiskit documentation and release notes were scrutinized to create an initial taxonomy of refactoring required for migrating between Qiskit releases. Two taxonomies were produced: one by expert developers and one by an LLM. These taxonomies were compared, analyzing differences and similarities, and were integrated into a unified taxonomy that reflects the findings of both methods. By systematically categorizing refactoring challenges in Qiskit, the unified taxonomy is a foundation for future research on AI-assisted migration while enabling a more rigorous evaluation of automated refactoring techniques. Additionally, this work contributes to quantum software engineering (QSE) by enhancing software development workflows, improving language compatibility, and promoting best practices in quantum programming.

      Empirical software engineering faces a critical gap: the lack of standardized tools for rapid development and execution of Test-Driven Software Experiments (TDSEs) -- that is, experiments that involve the execution of software subjects and the observation and analysis of their "de facto" run-time behavior. In this paper we present a general-purpose analysis platform called LASSO that provides a minimal set of domain-specific languages and data structures to conduct TDSEs. By empowering users with an executable scripting language to design and execute TDSEs, LASSO enables efficient evaluation of run-time semantics and execution characteristics in addition to statically determined properties. We present an example TDSE that demonstrates the practical benefits of LASSO's scripting capabilities for assessing the reliability of LLMs for code generation by means of a self-contained, reusable and extensible study script.

      The research in AI-based formal mathematical reasoning has shown an unstoppable growth trend. These studies have excelled in mathematical competitions like IMO and have made significant progress. This paper focuses on formal verification, an immediate application scenario of formal reasoning, and breaks it down into sub-tasks. We constructed 18k high-quality instruction-response pairs across five formal specification languages (Coq, Lean4, Dafny, ACSL, and TLA+) by distilling gpt-4o and evaluated against ten open-sourced LLMs, including recent popular DeepSeek-R1. We also fine-tuned several 7~8B small models to achieve comparable performance with Deepseek-R1-671B. Interestingly, we observed that fine-tuning with formal data also enhances mathematics, reasoning, and coding capabilities. Fine-tuned models are released at https: //huggingface.co/fm-universe.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on the transformer architecture and its self-attention mechanism to deliver strong performance across tasks. However, we uncover a structural inefficiency in standard pre-trained decoder-style LLMs: in many of the deeper layers, attention matrices frequently collapse to near rank-one, single-column patterns. We refer to these underutilized components as lazy layers, which are redundant and computationally inefficient. To address this, we propose Inheritune, a simple and effective training recipe for building smaller, more efficient, and high performing language models. Inheritune initializes a compact model by inheriting the useful early layers from a larger pre-trained model, then progressively retrains and expands it. Our experiments across multiple models and datasets show that Inheritune trained models, despite having significantly fewer layers, can match or even outperform their larger counterparts. This approach yields compact, performant models and offers a practical path for efficient language model compression. Code is available at https://github.com/sanyalsunny111/LLM-Inheritune

      Unit testing plays a critical role in ensuring software correctness. However, writing unit tests manually is laborious, especially for strong typed languages like Java, motivating the need for automated approaches. Traditional methods primarily rely on search-based or randomized algorithms to generate tests that achieve high code coverage and produce regression oracles, which are derived from the program's current behavior rather than its intended functionality. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled oracle generation from natural language descriptions. However, existing LLM-based methods often require LLM fine-tuning or rely on external tools such as EvoSuite for test prefix generation. In this work, we propose CANDOR, a novel end-to-end, prompt-based LLM framework for automated JUnit test generation. CANDOR orchestrates multiple specialized LLM agents to generate JUnit tests, including both high-quality test prefixes and accurate oracles. To mitigate the notorious hallucinations in LLMs, we introduce a novel strategy that engages multiple reasoning LLMs in a panel discussion and generate accurate oracles based on consensus. Additionally, to reduce the verbosity of reasoning LLMs' outputs, we propose a novel dual-LLM pipeline to produce concise and structured oracle evaluations. Our experiments on the HumanEvalJava and LeetCodeJava datasets show that CANDOR can generate accurate oracles and is slightly better than EvoSuite in generating tests with high line coverage and clearly superior in terms of mutation score. Moreover, CANDOR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art, prompt-based test generator LLM-Empirical, achieving improvements of 15.8 to 25.1 percentage points in oracle correctness on both correct and faulty source code. Ablation studies confirm the critical contributions of key agents in improving test prefix quality and oracle accuracy.

      Large language models (LLMs)-empowered web agents enables automating complex, real-time web navigation tasks in enterprise environments. However, existing web agents relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often struggle with generalization and robustness due to insufficient reasoning capabilities when handling the inherently dynamic nature of web interactions. In this study, we introduce WorkForceAgent-R1, an LLM-based web agent trained using a rule-based R1-style reinforcement learning framework designed explicitly to enhance single-step reasoning and planning for business-oriented web navigation tasks. We employ a structured reward function that evaluates both adherence to output formats and correctness of actions, enabling WorkForceAgent-R1 to implicitly learn robust intermediate reasoning without explicit annotations or extensive expert demonstrations. Extensive experiments on the WorkArena benchmark demonstrate that WorkForceAgent-R1 substantially outperforms SFT baselines by 10.26-16.59%, achieving competitive performance relative to proprietary LLM-based agents (gpt-4o) in workplace-oriented web navigation tasks.

      Selecting a sample generation scheme from multiple prompt-based generative models, including large language models (LLMs) and prompt-guided image and video generation models, is typically addressed by choosing the model that maximizes an averaged evaluation score. However, this score-based selection overlooks the possibility that different models achieve the best generation performance for different types of text prompts. An online identification of the best generation model for various input prompts can reduce the costs associated with querying sub-optimal models. In this work, we explore the possibility of varying rankings of text-based generative models for different text prompts and propose an online learning framework to predict the best data generation model for a given input prompt. The proposed PAK-UCB algorithm addresses a contextual bandit (CB) setting with shared context variables across the arms, utilizing the generated data to update kernel-based functions that predict the score of each model available for unseen text prompts. Additionally, we leverage random Fourier features (RFF) to accelerate the online learning process of PAK-UCB. Our numerical experiments on real and simulated text-to-image and image-to-text generative models show that RFF-UCB performs successfully in identifying the best generation model across different sample types.

      The evolution of cooperation has been extensively studied using abstract mathematical models and simulations. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLM) and the rise of LLM agents have demonstrated their ability to perform social reasoning, thus providing an opportunity to test the emergence of norms in more realistic agent-based simulations with human-like reasoning using natural language. In this research, we investigate whether the cooperation dynamics presented in Boyd and Richerson's model persist in a more realistic simulation of the diner's dilemma using LLM agents compared to the abstract mathematical nature in the work of Boyd and Richerson. Our findings indicate that agents follow the strategies defined in the Boyd and Richerson model, and explicit punishment mechanisms drive norm emergence, reinforcing cooperative behaviour even when the agent strategy configuration varies. Our results suggest that LLM-based Multi-Agent System simulations, in fact, can replicate the evolution of cooperation predicted by the traditional mathematical models. Moreover, our simulations extend beyond the mathematical models by integrating natural language-driven reasoning and a pairwise imitation method for strategy adoption, making them a more realistic testbed for cooperative behaviour in MASs.

      The translation of Low Dynamic Range (LDR) to High Dynamic Range (HDR) images is an important computer vision task. There is a significant amount of research utilizing both conventional non-learning methods and modern data-driven approaches, focusing on using both single-exposed and multi-exposed LDR for HDR image reconstruction. However, most current state-of-the-art methods require high-quality paired {LDR,HDR} datasets for model training. In addition, there is limited literature on using unpaired datasets for this task, that is, the model learns a mapping between domains, i.e., {LDR,HDR}. This paper proposes LLM-HDR, a method that integrates the perception of Large Language Models (LLM) into a modified semantic- and cycle-consistent adversarial architecture that utilizes unpaired {LDR,HDR} datasets for training. The method introduces novel artifact- and exposure-aware generators to address visual artifact removal and an encoder and loss to address semantic consistency, another under-explored topic. LLM-HDR is the first to use an LLM for the {LDR,HDR} translation task in a self-supervised setup. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance across several benchmark datasets and reconstructs high-quality HDR images.

      As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly participate in human-AI interactions, evaluating their Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities - particularly their ability to track dynamic mental states - becomes crucial. While existing benchmarks assess basic ToM abilities, they predominantly focus on static snapshots of mental states, overlooking the temporal evolution that characterizes real-world social interactions. We present \textsc{DynToM}, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to understand and track the temporal progression of mental states across interconnected scenarios. Through a systematic four-step framework, we generate 1,100 social contexts encompassing 5,500 scenarios and 78,100 questions, each validated for realism and quality. Our comprehensive evaluation of ten state-of-the-art LLMs reveals that their average performance underperforms humans by 44.7\%, with performance degrading significantly when tracking and reasoning about the shift of mental states. This performance gap highlights fundamental limitations in current LLMs' ability to model the dynamic nature of human mental states.

      The recent success of generative AI highlights the crucial role of high-quality human feedback in building trustworthy AI systems. However, the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) by crowdsourcing workers poses a significant challenge: datasets intended to reflect human input may be compromised by LLM-generated responses. Existing LLM detection approaches often rely on high-dimension training data such as text, making them unsuitable for annotation tasks like multiple-choice labeling. In this work, we investigate the potential of peer prediction -- a mechanism that evaluates the information within workers' responses without using ground truth -- to mitigate LLM-assisted cheating in crowdsourcing with a focus on annotation tasks. Our approach quantifies the correlations between worker answers while conditioning on (a subset of) LLM-generated labels available to the requester. Building on prior research, we propose a training-free scoring mechanism with theoretical guarantees under a crowdsourcing model that accounts for LLM collusion. We establish conditions under which our method is effective and empirically demonstrate its robustness in detecting low-effort cheating on real-world crowdsourcing datasets.

      As API access becomes a primary interface to large language models (LLMs), users often interact with black-box systems that offer little transparency into the deployed model. To reduce costs or maliciously alter model behaviors, API providers may discreetly serve quantized or fine-tuned variants, which can degrade performance and compromise safety. Detecting such substitutions is difficult, as users lack access to model weights and, in most cases, even output logits. To tackle this problem, we propose a rank-based uniformity test that can verify the behavioral equality of a black-box LLM to a locally deployed authentic model. Our method is accurate, query-efficient, and avoids detectable query patterns, making it robust to adversarial providers that reroute or mix responses upon the detection of testing attempts. We evaluate the approach across diverse threat scenarios, including quantization, harmful fine-tuning, jailbreak prompts, and full model substitution, showing that it consistently achieves superior statistical power over prior methods under constrained query budgets.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in tasks requiring complex reasoning, such as code generation, mathematical problem solving, and algorithmic synthesis -- especially when aided by reasoning tokens and Chain-of-Thought prompting. Yet, a core question remains: do these models truly reason, or do they merely exploit shallow statistical patterns? In this paper, we systematically investigate the robustness of reasoning LLMs by introducing a suite of semantically faithful yet adversarially structured prompt perturbations. Our evaluation -- spanning 700 perturbed code generations derived from LeetCode-style problems -- applies transformations such as storytelling reframing, irrelevant constraint injection, example reordering, and numeric perturbation. We observe that while certain modifications severely degrade performance (with accuracy drops up to -42.1%), others surprisingly improve model accuracy by up to 35.3%, suggesting sensitivity not only to semantics but also to surface-level prompt dynamics. These findings expose the fragility and unpredictability of current reasoning systems, underscoring the need for more principles approaches to reasoning alignments and prompting robustness. We release our perturbation datasets and evaluation framework to promote further research in trustworthy and resilient LLM reasoning.

      Large language models (LLMs), known for their comprehension capabilities and extensive knowledge, have been increasingly applied to recommendation systems (RS). Given the fundamental gap between the mechanism of LLMs and the requirement of RS, researchers have focused on fine-tuning LLMs with recommendation-specific data to enhance their performance. Language Modeling Loss (LML), originally designed for language generation tasks, is commonly adopted. However, we identify two critical limitations of LML: 1) it exhibits significant divergence from the recommendation objective; 2) it erroneously treats all fictitious item descriptions as negative samples, introducing misleading training signals. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Masked Softmax Loss (MSL) tailored for fine-tuning LLMs on recommendation. MSL improves LML by identifying and masking invalid tokens that could lead to fictitious item descriptions during loss computation. This strategy can effectively avoid the interference from erroneous negative signals and ensure well alignment with the recommendation objective supported by theoretical guarantees. During implementation, we identify a potential challenge related to gradient vanishing of MSL. To overcome this, we further introduce the temperature coefficient and propose an Adaptive Temperature Strategy (ATS) that adaptively adjusts the temperature without requiring extensive hyperparameter tuning. Extensive experiments conducted on four public datasets further validate the effectiveness of MSL, achieving an average improvement of 42.24% in NDCG@10.

      We aim to improve the reasoning capabilities of language models via reinforcement learning (RL). Recent RL post-trained models like DeepSeek-R1 have demonstrated reasoning abilities on mathematical and coding tasks. However, prior studies suggest that using RL alone to improve reasoning on inherently difficult tasks is less effective. Here, we draw inspiration from curriculum learning and propose to schedule tasks from easy to hard (E2H), allowing LLMs to build reasoning skills gradually. Our method is termed E2H Reasoner. Empirically, we observe that, although easy tasks are important initially, fading them out through appropriate scheduling is essential in preventing overfitting. Theoretically, we establish convergence guarantees for E2H Reasoner within an approximate policy iteration framework. We derive finite-sample complexity bounds and show that when tasks are appropriately decomposed and conditioned, learning through curriculum stages requires fewer total samples than direct learning. Experiments across multiple domains show that E2H Reasoner significantly improves the reasoning ability of small LLMs (1.5B to 3B), which otherwise struggle when trained with vanilla RL alone, highlighting the effectiveness of our method.

      Training medical personnel using standardized patients (SPs) remains a complex challenge, requiring extensive domain expertise and role-specific practice. Previous research on Large Language Model (LLM)-based SPs mostly focuses on improving data retrieval accuracy or adjusting prompts through human feedback. However, this focus has overlooked the critical need for patient agents to learn a standardized presentation pattern that transforms data into human-like patient responses through unsupervised simulations. To address this gap, we propose EvoPatient, a novel simulated patient framework in which a patient agent and doctor agents simulate the diagnostic process through multi-turn dialogues, simultaneously gathering experience to improve the quality of both questions and answers, ultimately enabling human doctor training. Extensive experiments on various cases demonstrate that, by providing only overall SP requirements, our framework improves over existing reasoning methods by more than 10\% in requirement alignment and better human preference, while achieving an optimal balance of resource consumption after evolving over 200 cases for 10 hours, with excellent generalizability.

      Deploying large language models (LLMs) for online inference is often constrained by limited GPU memory, particularly due to the growing KV cache during auto-regressive decoding. Hybrid GPU-CPU execution has emerged as a promising solution by offloading KV cache management and parts of attention computation to the CPU. However, a key bottleneck remains: existing schedulers fail to effectively overlap CPU-offloaded tasks with GPU execution during the latency-critical, bandwidth-bound decode phase. This particularly penalizes real-time, decode-heavy applications (e.g., chat, Chain-of-Thought reasoning) which are currently underserved by existing systems, especially under memory pressure typical of edge or low-cost deployments. We present APEX, a novel, profiling-informed scheduling strategy that maximizes CPU-GPU parallelism during hybrid LLM inference. Unlike systems relying on static rules or purely heuristic approaches, APEX dynamically dispatches compute across heterogeneous resources by predicting execution times of CPU and GPU subtasks to maximize overlap while avoiding scheduling overheads. We evaluate APEX on diverse workloads and GPU architectures (NVIDIA T4, A10), using LLaMa-2-7B and LLaMa-3.1-8B models. Compared to GPU-only schedulers like VLLM, APEX improves throughput by 84% - 96% on T4 and 11% - 89% on A10 GPUs, while preserving latency. Against the best existing hybrid schedulers, it delivers up to 49% (T4) and 37% (A10) higher throughput in long-output settings. APEX significantly advances hybrid LLM inference efficiency on such memory-constrained hardware and provides a blueprint for scheduling in heterogeneous AI systems, filling a critical gap for efficient real-time LLM applications.

      Accurate and interpretable detection of depressive language in social media is useful for early interventions of mental health conditions, and has important implications for both clinical practice and broader public health efforts. In this paper, we investigate the performance of large language models (LLMs) and traditional machine learning classifiers across three classification tasks involving social media data: binary depression classification, depression severity classification, and differential diagnosis classification among depression, PTSD, and anxiety. Our study compares zero-shot LLMs with supervised classifiers trained on both conventional text embeddings and LLM-generated summary embeddings. Our experiments reveal that while zero-shot LLMs demonstrate strong generalization capabilities in binary classification, they struggle with fine-grained ordinal classifications. In contrast, classifiers trained on summary embeddings generated by LLMs demonstrate competitive, and in some cases superior, performance on the classification tasks, particularly when compared to models using traditional text embeddings. Our findings demonstrate the strengths of LLMs in mental health prediction, and suggest promising directions for better utilization of their zero-shot capabilities and context-aware summarization techniques.

      LLMs have immense potential for generating plans, transforming an initial world state into a desired goal state. A large body of research has explored the use of LLMs for various planning tasks, from web navigation to travel planning and database querying. However, many of these systems are tailored to specific problems, making it challenging to compare them or determine the best approach for new tasks. There is also a lack of clear and consistent evaluation criteria. Our survey aims to offer a comprehensive overview of current LLM planners to fill this gap. It builds on foundational work by Kartam and Wilkins (1990) and examines six key performance criteria: completeness, executability, optimality, representation, generalization, and efficiency. For each, we provide a thorough analysis of representative works and highlight their strengths and weaknesses. Our paper also identifies crucial future directions, making it a valuable resource for both practitioners and newcomers interested in leveraging LLM planning to support agentic workflows.

      Research into Video Large Language Models (LLMs) has progressed rapidly, with numerous models and benchmarks emerging in just a few years. Typically, these models are initialized with a pretrained text-only LLM and finetuned on both image- and video-caption datasets. In this paper, we present findings indicating that Video LLMs are more capable of temporal reasoning after image-only training than one would assume, and that improvements from video-specific training are surprisingly small. Specifically, we show that image-trained versions of two LLMs trained with the recent LongVU algorithm perform significantly above chance level on TVBench, a temporal reasoning benchmark. Additionally, we introduce a simple finetuning scheme involving sequences of annotated images and questions targeting temporal capabilities. This baseline results in temporal reasoning performance close to, and occasionally higher than, what is achieved by video-trained LLMs. This suggests suboptimal utilization of rich temporal features found in real video by current models. Our analysis motivates further research into the mechanisms that allow image-trained LLMs to perform temporal reasoning, as well as into the bottlenecks that render current video training schemes inefficient.

      While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success on a broad range of tasks, math reasoning remains a challenging one. One of the approaches for improving math reasoning is self-correction, which designs self-improving loops to let the model correct its own mistakes. However, existing self-correction approaches treat corrections as standalone post-generation refinements, relying on extra prompt and system designs to elicit self-corrections, instead of performing real-time, spontaneous self-corrections in a single pass. To address this, we propose SPOC, a spontaneous self-correction approach that enables LLMs to generate interleaved solutions and verifications in a single inference pass, with generation dynamically terminated based on verification outcomes, thereby effectively scaling inference time compute. SPOC considers a multi-agent perspective by assigning dual roles -- solution proposer and verifier -- to the same model. We adopt a simple yet effective approach to generate synthetic data for fine-tuning, enabling the model to develop capabilities for self-verification and multi-agent collaboration. We further improve its solution proposal and verification accuracy through online reinforcement learning. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that SPOC significantly improves performance. Notably, SPOC boosts the accuracy of Llama-3.1-8B and 70B Instruct models, achieving gains of 8.8% and 11.6% on MATH500, 10.0% and 20.0% on AMC23, and 3.3% and 6.7% on AIME24, respectively.

Our benchmarks consist of decision-making tasks derived from key problems in economics. To forestall saturation, the benchmark tasks are synthetically generated with scalable difficulty levels. Additionally, we propose litmus tests, a new kind of quantitative measure for LLMs and LLM agents. Unlike benchmarks, litmus tests quantify differences in character, values, and tendencies of LLMs and LLM agents, by considering their behavior when faced with tradeoffs (e.g., efficiency versus equality) where there is no objectively right or wrong behavior. Overall, our benchmarks and litmus tests assess the abilities and tendencies of LLM agents in tackling complex economic problems in diverse settings spanning procurement, scheduling, task allocation, and pricing -- applications that should grow in importance as such agents are further integrated into the economy.

      The development of large language models (LLMs) has been instrumental in advancing state-of-the-art natural language processing applications. Training LLMs with billions of parameters and trillions of tokens require sophisticated distributed systems that enable composing and comparing several state-of-the-art techniques in order to efficiently scale across thousands of accelerators. However, existing solutions are complex, scattered across multiple libraries/repositories, lack interoperability, and are cumbersome to maintain. Thus, curating and empirically comparing training recipes require non-trivial engineering effort. This paper introduces TorchTitan, an open-source, PyTorch-native distributed training system that unifies state-of-the-art techniques, streamlining integration and reducing overhead. TorchTitan enables 3D parallelism in a modular manner with elastic scaling, providing comprehensive logging, checkpointing, and debugging tools for production-ready training. It also incorporates hardware-software co-designed solutions, leveraging features like Float8 training and SymmetricMemory. As a flexible test bed, TorchTitan facilitates custom recipe curation and comparison, allowing us to develop optimized training recipes for Llama 3.1 and provide guidance on selecting techniques for maximum efficiency based on our experiences. We thoroughly assess TorchTitan on the Llama 3.1 family of LLMs, spanning 8 billion to 405 billion parameters, and showcase its exceptional performance, modular composability, and elastic scalability. By stacking training optimizations, we demonstrate accelerations of 65.08% with 1D parallelism at the 128-GPU scale (Llama 3.1 8B), an additional 12.59% with 2D parallelism at the 256-GPU scale (Llama 3.1 70B), and an additional 30% with 3D parallelism at the 512-GPU scale (Llama 3.1 405B) on NVIDIA H100 GPUs over optimized baselines.

We introduce MathOlympiadEval, a new dataset with fine-grained annotations, which reveals a significant gap between LLMs' answer correctness and their low process correctness. Existing automated methods like LLM-as-a-judge struggle to reliably detect these reasoning flaws. To address this, we propose ParaStepVerifier, a novel methodology for meticulous, step-by-step verification of mathematical solutions. ParaStepVerifier identifies incorrect reasoning steps. Empirical results demonstrate that ParaStepVerifier substantially improves the accuracy of identifying flawed solutions compared to baselines, especially for complex, multi-step problems. This offers a more robust path towards evaluating and training LLMs with genuine mathematical reasoning.

To fill this gap, we systematize existing LLM watermarkers and watermark removal attacks, mapping out their design spaces. We then develop WaterPark, a unified platform that integrates 10 state-of-the-art watermarkers and 12 representative attacks. More importantly, by leveraging WaterPark, we conduct a comprehensive assessment of existing watermarkers, unveiling the impact of various design choices on their attack robustness. We further explore the best practices to operate watermarkers in adversarial environments.

      Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in various tasks, including those requiring human-level intelligence, such as vulnerability detection. However, recent efforts to use LLMs for vulnerability detection remain preliminary, as they lack a deep understanding of whether a subject LLM's vulnerability reasoning capability stems from the model itself or from external aids such as knowledge retrieval and tooling support. In this paper, we aim to decouple LLMs' vulnerability reasoning from other capabilities, such as vulnerability knowledge adoption, context information retrieval, and advanced prompt schemes. We introduce LLM4Vuln, a unified evaluation framework that separates and assesses LLMs' vulnerability reasoning capabilities and examines improvements when combined with other enhancements. To support this evaluation, we construct UniVul, the first benchmark that provides retrievable knowledge and context-supplementable code across three representative programming languages: Solidity, Java, and C/C++. Using LLM4Vuln and UniVul, we test six representative LLMs (GPT-4.1, Phi-3, Llama-3, o4-mini, DeepSeek-R1, and QwQ-32B) for 147 ground-truth vulnerabilities and 147 non-vulnerable cases in 3,528 controlled scenarios. Our findings reveal the varying impacts of knowledge enhancement, context supplementation, and prompt schemes.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit a notable performance ceiling on complex, multi-faceted tasks, as they often fail to integrate diverse information or adhere to multiple constraints. We posit that such limitation arises when the demands of a task exceed the LLM's effective cognitive load capacity. This interpretation draws a strong analogy to Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) in cognitive science, which explains similar performance boundaries in the human mind, and is further supported by emerging evidence that reveals LLMs have bounded working memory characteristics. Building upon this CLT-grounded understanding, we introduce CoThinker, a novel LLM-based multi-agent framework designed to mitigate cognitive overload and enhance collaborative problem-solving abilities. CoThinker operationalizes CLT principles by distributing intrinsic cognitive load through agent specialization and managing transactional load via structured communication and a collective working memory. We empirically validate CoThinker on complex problem-solving tasks and fabricated high cognitive load scenarios, demonstrating improvements over existing multi-agent baselines in solution quality and efficiency. Our analysis reveals characteristic interaction patterns, providing insights into the emergence of collective cognition and effective load management, thus offering a principled approach to overcoming LLM performance ceilings.

      Accurate identification of software vulnerabilities is crucial for system integrity. Vulnerability datasets, often derived from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) or directly from GitHub, are essential for training machine learning models to detect these security flaws. However, these datasets frequently suffer from significant noise, typically 40% to 75%, due primarily to the automatic and indiscriminate labeling of all changes in vulnerability-fixing commits (VFCs) as vulnerability-related. This misclassification occurs because not all changes in a commit aimed at fixing vulnerabilities pertain to security threats; many are routine updates like bug fixes or test improvements. This paper introduces the first methodology that uses the Large Language Model (LLM) with a heuristic enhancement to automatically identify vulnerability-fixing changes from VFCs, achieving an F1-score of 0.82. VulSifter was applied to a large-scale study, where we conducted a crawl of 127,063 repositories on GitHub, resulting in the acquisition of 5,352,105 commits. VulSifter involves utilizing an LLM to comprehend code semantics and contextual information, while applying heuristics to filter out unrelated changes. We then developed CleanVul, a high-quality dataset comprising 8,203 functions using our LLM heuristic enhancement approach, demonstrating Correctness (90.6%) comparable to established datasets such as SVEN and PrimeVul. To evaluate the CleanVul dataset, we conducted experiments focusing on fine-tuning various LLMs on CleanVul and other high-quality datasets. Evaluation results reveal that LLMs fine-tuned on CleanVul not only exhibit enhanced accuracy but also superior generalization capabilities compared to those trained on uncleaned datasets. Specifically, models trained on CleanVul and tested on PrimeVul achieve accuracy higher than those trained and tested exclusively on PrimeVul.

      This paper investigates the potentials of Large Language Models (LLMs) as adaptive tutors in the context of second-language learning. In particular, we evaluate whether system prompting can reliably constrain LLMs to generate only text appropriate to the student's competence level. We simulate full teacher-student dialogues in Spanish using instruction-tuned, open-source LLMs ranging in size from 7B to 12B parameters. Dialogues are generated by having an LLM alternate between tutor and student roles with separate chat histories. The output from the tutor model is then used to evaluate the effectiveness of CEFR-based prompting to control text difficulty across three proficiency levels (A1, B1, C1). Our findings suggest that while system prompting can be used to constrain model outputs, prompting alone is too brittle for sustained, long-term interactional contexts - a phenomenon we term alignment drift. Our results provide insights into the feasibility of LLMs for personalized, proficiency-aligned adaptive tutors and provide a scalable method for low-cost evaluation of model performance without human participants.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation, capable of tackling complex tasks during inference. However, the extent to which LLMs can be utilized for code checking or debugging through test case generation remains largely unexplored. We investigate this problem from the perspective of competition-level programming (CP) programs and propose TCGBench, a Benchmark for (LLM generation of) Test Case Generators. This benchmark comprises two tasks, aimed at studying the capabilities of LLMs in (1) generating valid test case generators for a given CP problem, and further (2) generating targeted test case generators that expose bugs in human-written code. Experimental results indicate that while state-of-the-art LLMs can generate valid test case generators in most cases, most LLMs struggle to generate targeted test cases that reveal flaws in human code effectively. Especially, even advanced reasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) fall significantly short of human performance in the task of generating targeted generators. Furthermore, we construct a high-quality, manually curated dataset of instructions for generating targeted generators. Analysis demonstrates that the performance of LLMs can be enhanced with the aid of this dataset, by both prompting and fine-tuning.

Our results show that although the expectations and thoughts generated by LLM Agents are more homogeneous than those of human participants, they still effectively capture key heterogeneity across agents and the underlying drivers of expectation formation. Furthermore, a module-ablation exercise highlights the critical role of prior expectations in simulating such heterogeneity. This approach complements traditional survey methods and offers new insights into AI behavioral science in macroeconomic research.

This paper presents the first systematic review and taxonomy focusing on LLMbased approaches in credit risk estimation. We determined the basic model architectures by selecting 60 relevant papers published between 2020-2025 with the PRISMA research strategy. And we examined the data used for scenarios such as credit default prediction and risk analysis. Since the main focus of the paper is interpretability, we classify concepts such as explainability mechanisms, chain of thought prompts and natural language justifications for LLM-based credit models. The taxonomy organizes the literature under four main headings: model architectures, data types, explainability mechanisms and application areas. Based on this analysis, we highlight the main future trends and research gaps for LLM-based credit scoring systems.

      Implicit content plays a crucial role in political discourse, where speakers systematically employ pragmatic strategies such as implicatures and presuppositions to influence their audiences. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in tasks requiring complex semantic and pragmatic understanding, highlighting their potential for detecting and explaining the meaning of implicit content. However, their ability to do this within political discourse remains largely underexplored. Leveraging, for the first time, the large IMPAQTS corpus, which comprises Italian political speeches with the annotation of manipulative implicit content, we propose methods to test the effectiveness of LLMs in this challenging problem. Through a multiple-choice task and an open-ended generation task, we demonstrate that all tested models struggle to interpret presuppositions and implicatures. We conclude that current LLMs lack the key pragmatic capabilities necessary for accurately interpreting highly implicit language, such as that found in political discourse. At the same time, we highlight promising trends and future directions for enhancing model performance. We release our data and code at https://github.com/WalterPaci/IMPAQTS-PID

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed to automatically refactor unit tests, aiming to enhance readability, naming, and structural clarity while preserving functional behavior. However, evaluating such refactorings remains challenging: traditional metrics like CodeBLEU are overly sensitive to renaming and structural edits, whereas embedding-based similarities capture semantics but ignore readability and modularity. We introduce CTSES, a composite metric that integrates CodeBLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE-L to balance behavior preservation, lexical quality, and structural alignment. CTSES is evaluated on over 5,000 test suites automatically refactored by GPT-4o and Mistral-Large-2407, using Chain-of-Thought prompting, across two established Java benchmarks: Defects4J and SF110. Our results show that CTSES yields more faithful and interpretable assessments, better aligned with developer expectations and human intuition than existing metrics.

      This paper evaluates geopolitical biases in LLMs with respect to various countries though an analysis of their interpretation of historical events with conflicting national perspectives (USA, UK, USSR, and China). We introduce a novel dataset with neutral event descriptions and contrasting viewpoints from different countries. Our findings show significant geopolitical biases, with models favoring specific national narratives. Additionally, simple debiasing prompts had a limited effect in reducing these biases. Experiments with manipulated participant labels reveal models' sensitivity to attribution, sometimes amplifying biases or recognizing inconsistencies, especially with swapped labels. This work highlights national narrative biases in LLMs, challenges the effectiveness of simple debiasing methods, and offers a framework and dataset for future geopolitical bias research.

      Multi-hand semantic grasp generation aims to generate feasible and semantically appropriate grasp poses for different robotic hands based on natural language instructions. Although the task is highly valuable, due to the lack of multihand grasp datasets with fine-grained contact description between robotic hands and objects, it is still a long-standing difficult task. In this paper, we present Multi-GraspSet, the first large-scale multi-hand grasp dataset with automatically contact annotations. Based on Multi-GraspSet, we propose Multi-GraspLLM, a unified language-guided grasp generation framework, which leverages large language models (LLM) to handle variable-length sequences, generating grasp poses for diverse robotic hands in a single unified architecture. Multi-GraspLLM first aligns the encoded point cloud features and text features into a unified semantic space. It then generates grasp bin tokens that are subsequently converted into grasp pose for each robotic hand via hand-aware linear mapping. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in both real-world experiments and simulator.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) possess general world knowledge but often struggle to generate precise predictions in structured, domain-specific contexts such as simulations. These limitations arise from their inability to ground their broad, unstructured understanding in specific environments. To address this, we present WorldLLM, a framework that enhances LLM-based world modeling by combining Bayesian inference and autonomous active exploration with reinforcement learning. WorldLLM leverages the in-context learning abilities of LLMs to guide an LLM-based world model's predictions using natural language hypotheses given in its prompt. These hypotheses are iteratively refined through a Bayesian inference framework that leverages a second LLM as the proposal distribution given collected evidence. This evidence is collected using a curiosity-driven reinforcement learning policy that explores the environment to find transitions with a low log-likelihood under our LLM-based predictive model using the current hypotheses. By alternating between refining hypotheses and collecting new evidence, our framework autonomously drives continual improvement of the predictions. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of WorldLLM in a textual game environment that requires agents to manipulate and combine objects. The framework not only enhances predictive accuracy, but also generates human-interpretable theories of environment dynamics.

      Large language models (LLMs) are used in chatbots or AI assistants to hold conversations with a human user. In such applications, the quality (e.g., user engagement, safety) of a conversation is important and can only be exactly known at the end of the conversation. To maximize its expected quality, conversation planning reasons about the stochastic transitions within a conversation to select the optimal LLM response at each turn. Existing simulation-based conversation planning algorithms typically select the optimal response by simulating future conversations with a large number of LLM queries at every turn. However, this process is extremely time-consuming and hence impractical for real-time conversations. This paper presents a novel approach called Semantic space COnversation Planning with improved Efficiency (SCOPE) that exploits the dense semantic representation of conversations to perform conversation planning efficiently. In particular, SCOPE models the stochastic transitions in conversation semantics and their associated rewards to plan entirely within the semantic space. This allows us to select the optimal LLM response at every conversation turn without needing additional LLM queries for simulation. As a result, SCOPE can perform conversation planning 70 times faster than conventional simulation-based planning algorithms when applied to a wide variety of conversation starters and two reward functions seen in the real world, yet achieving a higher reward within a practical planning budget.

      Detecting LLM-generated text in specialized and high-stakes domains like medicine and law is crucial for combating misinformation and ensuring authenticity. However, current zero-shot detectors, while effective on general text, often fail when applied to specialized content due to domain shift. We provide a theoretical analysis showing this failure is fundamentally linked to the KL divergence between human, detector, and source text distributions. To address this, we propose DivScore, a zero-shot detection framework using normalized entropy-based scoring and domain knowledge distillation to robustly identify LLM-generated text in specialized domains. We also release a domain-specific benchmark for LLM-generated text detection in the medical and legal domains. Experiments on our benchmark show that DivScore consistently outperforms state-of-the-art detectors, with 14.4% higher AUROC and 64.0% higher recall (0.1% false positive rate threshold). In adversarial settings, DivScore demonstrates superior robustness than other baselines, achieving on average 22.8% advantage in AUROC and 29.5% in recall. Code and data are publicly available.

Our approach achieves 2-7% absolute improvement in F1-score across classification tasks, compared to a random selection of examples.

      Legal mathematical reasoning is essential for applying large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes legal contexts, where outputs must be both mathematically accurate and procedurally compliant. However, existing legal LLMs lack structured numerical reasoning, and open-domain models, though capable of calculations, often overlook mandatory legal steps. To address this, we present LexNum, the first Chinese legal mathematical reasoning benchmark, covering three representative scenarios where each instance reflects legally grounded procedural flows. We further propose LexPam, a two-stage reinforcement learning framework for efficient legal reasoning training. Leveraging curriculum learning, we use a stronger teacher model to partition data into basic and challenging subsets. A lightweight 1.5B student model is then fine-tuned with Group Relative Policy Optimization, which avoids costly value networks and enables stable training from sparse, end-of-sequence rewards. The first stage improves accuracy and format; the second introduces a novel reward to guide procedural alignment via task-specific legal elements. Experiments show that existing models perform poorly on LexNum, while LexPam enhances both mathematical accuracy and legal coherence, and generalizes effectively across tasks and domains.

      User interface understanding with vision-language models (VLMs) has received much attention due to its potential for enhancing software automation. However, existing datasets used to build UI-VLMs either only contain large-scale context-free element annotations or contextualized functional descriptions for elements at a small scale. In this work, we propose the \textbf{AutoGUI} pipeline for automatically annotating UI elements with detailed functionality descriptions at scale. Specifically, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to infer element functionality by comparing UI state changes before and after simulated interactions. To improve annotation quality, we propose LLM-aided rejection and verification, eliminating invalid annotations without human labor. We construct a high-quality AutoGUI-704k dataset using the proposed pipeline, featuring diverse and detailed functionality annotations that are hardly provided by previous datasets. Human evaluation shows that we achieve annotation correctness comparable to a trained human annotator. Extensive experiments show that our dataset remarkably enhances VLM's UI grounding capabilities and exhibits significant scaling effects. We also show the interesting potential use of our dataset in UI agent tasks. Please view our project at https://autogui-project.github.io/.

      Jailbreak attacks against large language models (LLMs) aim to induce harmful behaviors in LLMs through carefully crafted adversarial prompts. To mitigate attacks, one way is to perform adversarial training (AT)-based alignment, i.e., training LLMs on some of the most adversarial prompts to help them learn how to behave safely under attacks. During AT, the length of adversarial prompts plays a critical role in the robustness of aligned LLMs. While long-length adversarial prompts during AT might lead to strong LLM robustness, their synthesis however is very resource-consuming, which may limit the application of LLM AT. This paper focuses on adversarial suffix jailbreak attacks and unveils that to defend against a jailbreak attack with an adversarial suffix of length $\Theta(M)$, it is enough to align LLMs on prompts with adversarial suffixes of length $\Theta(\sqrt{M})$. Theoretically, we analyze the adversarial in-context learning of linear transformers on linear regression tasks and prove a robust generalization bound for trained transformers. The bound depends on the term $\Theta(\sqrt{M_{\text{test}}}/M_{\text{train}})$, where $M_{\text{train}}$ and $M_{\text{test}}$ are the numbers of adversarially perturbed in-context samples during training and testing. Empirically, we conduct AT on popular open-source LLMs and evaluate their robustness against jailbreak attacks of different adversarial suffix lengths. Results confirm a positive correlation between the attack success rate and the ratio of the square root of the adversarial suffix length during jailbreaking to the length during AT. Our findings show that it is practical to defend against ``long-length'' jailbreak attacks via efficient ``short-length'' AT. The code is available at https://github.com/fshp971/adv-icl.

As an empirical proof of concept, we use LLMs to generate documents relevant to a topic which are more retrievable than existing ones. In addition, we demonstrate the potential merits of using corpus enrichment for retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and answer attribution in question answering.

      The OpenAI o1-series models have demonstrated that leveraging long-form Chain of Thought (CoT) can substantially enhance performance. However, the recursive thinking capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) remain limited, particularly in the absence of expert-curated data for distillation. In this paper, we propose \textbf{AvR}: \textbf{Alignment via Refinement}, a novel method aimed at unlocking the potential of LLMs for recursive reasoning through long-form CoT. AvR introduces a refinement process that integrates criticism and improvement actions, guided by differentiable learning techniques to optimize \textbf{refinement-aware rewards}. As a result, the synthesized multi-round data can be organized as a long refinement thought, further enabling test-time scaling. Experimental results show that AvR significantly outperforms conventional preference optimization methods. Notably, with only 3k synthetic samples, our method boosts the performance of the LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct model by over 20\% in win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming the landscape of digital content creation. However, the prevalent black-box Application Programming Interface (API) access to many LLMs introduces significant challenges in accountability, governance, and security. LLM fingerprinting, which aims to identify the source model by analyzing statistical and stylistic features of generated text, offers a potential solution. Current progress in this area is hindered by a lack of dedicated datasets and the need for efficient, practical methods that are robust against adversarial manipulations. To address these challenges, we introduce FD-Dataset, a comprehensive bilingual fingerprinting benchmark comprising 90,000 text samples from 20 famous proprietary and open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we present FDLLM, a novel fingerprinting method that leverages parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune a foundation model. This approach enables LoRA to extract deep, persistent features that characterize each source LLM. Through our analysis, we find that LoRA adaptation promotes the aggregation of outputs from the same LLM in representation space while enhancing the separation between different LLMs. This mechanism explains why LoRA proves particularly effective for LLM fingerprinting. Extensive empirical evaluations on FD-Dataset demonstrate FDLLM's superiority, achieving a Macro F1 score 22.1% higher than the strongest baseline. FDLLM also exhibits strong generalization to newly released models, achieving an average accuracy of 95% on unseen models. Notably, FDLLM remains consistently robust under various adversarial attacks, including polishing, translation, and synonym substitution. Experimental results show that FDLLM reduces the average attack success rate from 49.2% (LM-D) to 23.9%.

In this paper, we introduce TEDUO, a novel training pipeline for offline language-conditioned policy learning in symbolic environments. Unlike conventional methods, TEDUO operates on readily available, unlabeled datasets and addresses the challenge of generalization to previously unseen goals and states. Our approach harnesses large language models (LLMs) in a dual capacity: first, as automatization tools augmenting offline datasets with richer annotations, and second, as generalizable instruction-following agents. Empirical results demonstrate that TEDUO achieves data-efficient learning of robust language-conditioned policies, accomplishing tasks beyond the reach of conventional RL frameworks or out-of-the-box LLMs alone.

      Modeling urban crime is an important yet challenging task that requires understanding the subtle visual, social, and cultural cues embedded in urban environments. Previous work has predominantly focused on rule-based agent-based modeling (ABM) and deep learning methods. ABMs offer interpretability of internal mechanisms but exhibit limited predictive accuracy.In contrast, deep learning methods are often effective in prediction but are less interpretable and require extensive training data. Moreover, both lines of work lack the cognitive flexibility to adapt to changing environments. Leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), we propose CrimeMind, a novel LLM-driven ABM framework for simulating urban crime within a multi-modal urban context.A key innovation of our design is the integration of the Routine Activity Theory (RAT) into the agentic workflow of CrimeMind, enabling it to process rich multi-modal urban features and reason about criminal behavior.However, RAT requires LLM agents to infer subtle cues in evaluating environmental safety as part of assessing guardianship, which can be challenging for LLMs. To address this, we collect a small-scale human-annotated dataset and align CrimeMind's perception with human judgment via a training-free textual gradient method.Experiments across four major U.S. cities demonstrate that CrimeMind outperforms both traditional ABMs and deep learning baselines in crime hotspot prediction and spatial distribution accuracy, achieving up to a 24% improvement over the strongest baseline.Furthermore, we conduct counterfactual simulations of external incidents and policy interventions and it successfully captures the expected changes in crime patterns, demonstrating its ability to reflect counterfactual scenarios.Overall, CrimeMind enables fine-grained modeling of individual behaviors and facilitates evaluation of real-world interventions.

      The LLM-as-a-judge paradigm uses large language models (LLMs) for automated text evaluation, where a numerical assessment is assigned by an LLM to the input text following scoring rubrics. Existing methods for LLM-as-a-judge use cross-entropy (CE) loss for fine-tuning, which neglects the numeric nature of score prediction. Recent work addresses numerical prediction limitations of LLM fine-tuning through regression-aware fine-tuning, which, however, does not consider chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for score prediction. In this paper, we introduce TRACT (Two-stage Regression-Aware fine-tuning with CoT), a method combining CoT reasoning with regression-aware training. TRACT consists of two stages: first, seed LLM is fine-tuned to generate CoTs, which serve as supervision for the second stage fine-tuning. The training objective of TRACT combines the CE loss for learning the CoT reasoning capabilities, and the regression-aware loss for the score prediction. Experiments across four LLM-as-a-judge datasets and two LLMs show that TRACT significantly outperforms existing methods. Extensive ablation studies validate the importance of each component in TRACT.

      Automated machine learning (AutoML) accelerates AI development by automating tasks in the development pipeline, such as optimal model search and hyperparameter tuning. Existing AutoML systems often require technical expertise to set up complex tools, which is in general time-consuming and requires a large amount of human effort. Therefore, recent works have started exploiting large language models (LLM) to lessen such burden and increase the usability of AutoML frameworks via a natural language interface, allowing non-expert users to build their data-driven solutions. These methods, however, are usually designed only for a particular process in the AI development pipeline and do not efficiently use the inherent capacity of the LLMs. This paper proposes AutoML-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework tailored for full-pipeline AutoML, i.e., from data retrieval to model deployment. AutoML-Agent takes user's task descriptions, facilitates collaboration between specialized LLM agents, and delivers deployment-ready models. Unlike existing work, instead of devising a single plan, we introduce a retrieval-augmented planning strategy to enhance exploration to search for more optimal plans. We also decompose each plan into sub-tasks (e.g., data preprocessing and neural network design) each of which is solved by a specialized agent we build via prompting executing in parallel, making the search process more efficient. Moreover, we propose a multi-stage verification to verify executed results and guide the code generation LLM in implementing successful solutions. Extensive experiments on seven downstream tasks using fourteen datasets show that AutoML-Agent achieves a higher success rate in automating the full AutoML process, yielding systems with good performance throughout the diverse domains.

Many existing educational solutions rely on cloud-based infrastructure or proprietary tools, which are costly and may raise privacy concerns. Regulated industries with limited budgets require affordable, self-hosted solutions. We introduce an end-to-end, open-source framework leveraging small (3B-7B parameters), locally deployed LLMs for customized teaching material generation and assessment. Our system uniquely incorporates an interactive loop crucial for effective small-model refinement, and an auxiliary LLM verifier to mitigate jailbreaking risks, enhancing output reliability and safety. Utilizing Retrieval and Context Augmented Generation (RAG/CAG), it produces factually accurate, customized pedagogically-styled content.

      Large Language Model (LLM) agents equipped with external tools have become increasingly powerful for complex tasks such as web shopping, automated email replies, and financial trading. However, these advancements amplify the risks of adversarial attacks, especially when agents can access sensitive external functionalities. Nevertheless, manipulating LLM agents into performing targeted malicious actions or invoking specific tools remains challenging, as these agents extensively reason or plan before executing final actions. In this work, we present UDora, a unified red teaming framework designed for LLM agents that dynamically hijacks the agent's reasoning processes to compel malicious behavior. Specifically, UDora first generates the model's reasoning trace for the given task, then automatically identifies optimal points within this trace to insert targeted perturbations. The resulting perturbed reasoning is then used as a surrogate response for optimization. By iteratively applying this process, the LLM agent will then be induced to undertake designated malicious actions or to invoke specific malicious tools. Our approach demonstrates superior effectiveness compared to existing methods across three LLM agent datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/AI-secure/UDora.

      The growing application of artificial intelligence in sensitive domains has intensified the demand for systems that are not only accurate but also explainable and trustworthy. Although explainable AI (XAI) methods have proliferated, many do not consider the diverse audiences that interact with AI systems: from developers and domain experts to end-users and society. This paper addresses how trust in AI is influenced by the design and delivery of explanations and proposes a multilevel framework that aligns explanations with the epistemic, contextual, and ethical expectations of different stakeholders. The framework consists of three layers: algorithmic and domain-based, human-centered, and social explainability. We highlight the emerging role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in enhancing the social layer by generating accessible, natural language explanations. Through illustrative case studies, we demonstrate how this approach facilitates technical fidelity, user engagement, and societal accountability, reframing XAI as a dynamic, trust-building process.

      Large language model (LLM) embeddings offer a promising new avenue for database query optimization. In this paper, we explore how pre-trained execution plan embeddings can guide SQL query execution without the need for additional model training. We introduce LLM-PM (LLM-based Plan Mapping), a framework that embeds the default execution plan of a query, finds its k nearest neighbors among previously executed plans, and recommends database hintsets based on neighborhood voting. A lightweight consistency check validates the selected hint, while a fallback mechanism searches the full hint space when needed. Evaluated on the JOB-CEB benchmark using OpenGauss, LLM-PM achieves an average speed-up of 21% query latency reduction. This work highlights the potential of LLM-powered embeddings to deliver practical improvements in query performance and opens new directions for training-free, embedding-based optimizer guidance systems.

      On-demand ride-hailing services like DiDi, Uber, and Lyft have transformed urban transportation, offering unmatched convenience and flexibility. In this paper, we introduce DiMA, an LLM-powered ride-hailing assistant deployed in DiDi Chuxing. Its goal is to provide seamless ride-hailing services and beyond through a natural and efficient conversational interface under dynamic and complex spatiotemporal urban contexts. To achieve this, we propose a spatiotemporal-aware order planning module that leverages external tools for precise spatiotemporal reasoning and progressive order planning. Additionally, we develop a cost-effective dialogue system that integrates multi-type dialog repliers with cost-aware LLM configurations to handle diverse conversation goals and trade-off response quality and latency. Furthermore, we introduce a continual fine-tuning scheme that utilizes real-world interactions and simulated dialogues to align the assistant's behavior with human preferred decision-making processes. Since its deployment in the DiDi application, DiMA has demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving 93% accuracy in order planning and 92% in response generation during real-world interactions. Offline experiments further validate DiMA capabilities, showing improvements of up to 70.23% in order planning and 321.27% in response generation compared to three state-of-the-art agent frameworks, while reducing latency by $0.72\times$ to $5.47\times$. These results establish DiMA as an effective, efficient, and intelligent mobile assistant for ride-hailing services.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on historical web data inevitably become outdated. We investigate evaluation strategies and update methods for LLMs as new data becomes available. We introduce a web-scale dataset for time-continual pretraining of LLMs derived from 114 dumps of Common Crawl (CC) - orders of magnitude larger than previous continual language modeling benchmarks. We also design time-stratified evaluations across both general CC data and specific domains (Wikipedia, StackExchange, and code documentation) to assess how well various continual learning methods adapt to new data while retaining past knowledge. Our findings demonstrate that, on general CC data, autoregressive meta-schedules combined with a fixed-ratio replay of older data can achieve comparable held-out loss to re-training from scratch, while requiring significantly less computation (2.6x). However, the optimal balance between incorporating new data and replaying old data differs as replay is crucial to avoid forgetting on generic web data but less so on specific domains.

      Detoxification, the task of rewriting harmful language into non-toxic text, has become increasingly important amid the growing prevalence of toxic content online. However, high-quality parallel datasets for detoxification, especially for hate speech, remain scarce due to the cost and sensitivity of human annotation. In this paper, we propose a novel LLM-in-the-loop pipeline leveraging GPT-4o-mini for automated detoxification. We first replicate the ParaDetox pipeline by replacing human annotators with an LLM and show that the LLM performs comparably to human annotation. Building on this, we construct ParaDeHate, a large-scale parallel dataset specifically for hatespeech detoxification. We release ParaDeHate as a benchmark of over 8K hate/non-hate text pairs and evaluate a wide range of baseline methods. Experimental results show that models such as BART, fine-tuned on ParaDeHate, achieve better performance in style accuracy, content preservation, and fluency, demonstrating the effectiveness of LLM-generated detoxification text as a scalable alternative to human annotation.

      The scientific literature is growing rapidly, making it hard to keep track of the state-of-the-art. Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) aim to identify and evaluate all relevant papers on a topic. After retrieving a set of candidate papers, the abstract screening phase determines initial relevance. To date, abstract screening methods using large language models (LLMs) focus on binary classification settings; existing question answering (QA) based ranking approaches suffer from error propagation. LLMs offer a unique opportunity to evaluate the SLR's inclusion and exclusion criteria, yet, existing benchmarks do not provide them exhaustively. We manually extract these criteria as well as research questions for 57 SLRs, mostly in the medical domain, enabling principled comparisons between approaches. Moreover, we propose LGAR, a zero-shot LLM Guided Abstract Ranker composed of an LLM based graded relevance scorer and a dense re-ranker. Our extensive experiments show that LGAR outperforms existing QA-based methods by 5-10 pp. in mean average precision. Our code and data is publicly available.

      Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has shown great power in improving Large Language Models (LLMs). However, most existing RAG-based LLMs are dedicated to retrieving single modality information, mainly text; while for many real-world problems, such as healthcare, information relevant to queries can manifest in various modalities such as knowledge graph, text (clinical notes), and complex molecular structure. Thus, being able to retrieve relevant multi-modality domain-specific information, and reason and synthesize diverse knowledge to generate an accurate response is important. To address the gap, we present BioMol-MQA, a new question-answering (QA) dataset on polypharmacy, which is composed of two parts (i) a multimodal knowledge graph (KG) with text and molecular structure for information retrieval; and (ii) challenging questions that designed to test LLM capabilities in retrieving and reasoning over multimodal KG to answer questions. Our benchmarks indicate that existing LLMs struggle to answer these questions and do well only when given the necessary background data, signaling the necessity for strong RAG frameworks.

      While recent code-specific large language models (LLMs) have greatly enhanced their code generation capabilities, the safety of these models remains under-explored, posing potential risks as insecure code generated by these models may introduce vulnerabilities into real-world systems. Existing methods collect security-focused datasets from real-world vulnerabilities for instruction tuning in order to mitigate such issues. However, they are largely constrained by the data sparsity of vulnerable code, and have limited applicability in the multi-stage post-training workflows of modern LLMs. In this paper, we propose ProSec, a novel proactive security alignment approach designed to align code LLMs with secure coding practices. ProSec systematically exposes the vulnerabilities in a code LLM by synthesizing vulnerability-inducing coding scenarios from Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) and generates fixes to vulnerable code snippets, allowing the model to learn secure practices through preference learning objectives. The scenarios synthesized by ProSec trigger 25x more vulnerable code than a normal instruction-tuning dataset, resulting in a security-focused alignment dataset 7x larger than the previous work. Experiments show that models trained with ProSec are 25.2% to 35.4% more secure compared to previous work without degrading models' utility.

      Reward-model training is the cost bottleneck in modern Reinforcement Learning Human Feedback (RLHF) pipelines, often requiring tens of billions of parameters and an offline preference-tuning phase. In the proposed method, a frozen, instruction-tuned 7B LLM is augmented with only a one line JSON rubric and a rank-16 LoRA adapter (affecting just 0.8% of the model's parameters), enabling it to serve as a complete substitute for the previously used heavyweight evaluation models. The plug-and-play judge achieves 96.2% accuracy on RewardBench, outperforming specialized reward networks ranging from 27B to 70B parameters. Additionally, it allows a 7B actor to outperform the top 70B DPO baseline, which scores 61.8%, by achieving 92% exact match accuracy on GSM-8K utilizing online PPO. Thorough ablations indicate that (i) six in context demonstrations deliver the majority of the zero-to-few-shot improvements (+2pp), and (ii) the LoRA effectively addresses the remaining disparity, particularly in the safety and adversarial Chat-Hard segments. The proposed model introduces HH-Rationales, a subset of 10,000 pairs from Anthropic HH-RLHF, to examine interpretability, accompanied by human generated justifications. GPT-4 scoring indicates that our LoRA judge attains approximately = 9/10 in similarity to human explanations, while zero-shot judges score around =5/10. These results indicate that the combination of prompt engineering and tiny LoRA produces a cost effective, transparent, and easily adjustable reward function, removing the offline phase while achieving new state-of-the-art outcomes for both static evaluation and online RLHF.

      Temporal tabular question answering presents a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), requiring robust reasoning over structured data, which is a task where traditional prompting methods often fall short. These methods face challenges such as memorization, sensitivity to table size, and reduced performance on complex queries. To overcome these limitations, we introduce TempTabQA-C, a synthetic dataset designed for systematic and controlled evaluations, alongside a symbolic intermediate representation that transforms tables into database schemas. This structured approach allows LLMs to generate and execute SQL queries, enhancing generalization and mitigating biases. By incorporating adaptive few-shot prompting with contextually tailored examples, our method achieves superior robustness, scalability, and performance. Experimental results consistently highlight improvements across key challenges, setting a new benchmark for robust temporal reasoning with LLMs.

      LLM agents are widely used as agents for customer support, content generation, and code assistance. However, they are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, where adversarial inputs manipulate the model's behavior. Traditional defenses like input sanitization, guard models, and guardrails are either cumbersome or ineffective. In this paper, we propose a novel, lightweight defense mechanism called Polymorphic Prompt Assembling (PPA), which protects against prompt injection with near-zero overhead. The approach is based on the insight that prompt injection requires guessing and breaking the structure of the system prompt. By dynamically varying the structure of system prompts, PPA prevents attackers from predicting the prompt structure, thereby enhancing security without compromising performance. We conducted experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of PPA against existing attacks and compared it with other defense methods.

      Machine unlearning techniques aim to mitigate unintended memorization in large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches predominantly focus on the explicit removal of isolated facts, often overlooking latent inferential dependencies and the non-deterministic nature of knowledge within LLMs. Consequently, facts presumed forgotten may persist implicitly through correlated information. To address these challenges, we propose a knowledge unlearning evaluation framework that more accurately captures the implicit structure of real-world knowledge by representing relevant factual contexts as knowledge graphs with associated confidence scores. We further develop an inference-based evaluation protocol leveraging powerful LLMs as judges; these judges reason over the extracted knowledge subgraph to determine unlearning success. Our LLM judges utilize carefully designed prompts and are calibrated against human evaluations to ensure their trustworthiness and stability. Extensive experiments on our newly constructed benchmark demonstrate that our framework provides a more realistic and rigorous assessment of unlearning performance. Moreover, our findings reveal that current evaluation strategies tend to overestimate unlearning effectiveness.

      While understanding the knowledge boundaries of LLMs is crucial to prevent hallucination, research on the knowledge boundaries of LLMs has predominantly focused on English. In this work, we present the first study to analyze how LLMs recognize knowledge boundaries across different languages by probing their internal representations when processing known and unknown questions in multiple languages. Our empirical studies reveal three key findings: 1) LLMs' perceptions of knowledge boundaries are encoded in the middle to middle-upper layers across different languages. 2) Language differences in knowledge boundary perception follow a linear structure, which motivates our proposal of a training-free alignment method that effectively transfers knowledge boundary perception ability across languages, thereby helping reduce hallucination risk in low-resource languages; 3) Fine-tuning on bilingual question pair translation further enhances LLMs' recognition of knowledge boundaries across languages. Given the absence of standard testbeds for cross-lingual knowledge boundary analysis, we construct a multilingual evaluation suite comprising three representative types of knowledge boundary data.

      Developing algorithms to differentiate between machine-generated texts and human-written texts has garnered substantial attention in recent years. Existing methods in this direction typically concern an offline setting where a dataset containing a mix of real and machine-generated texts is given upfront, and the task is to determine whether each sample in the dataset is from a large language model (LLM) or a human. However, in many practical scenarios, sources such as news websites, social media accounts, and online forums publish content in a streaming fashion. Therefore, in this online scenario, how to quickly and accurately determine whether the source is an LLM with strong statistical guarantees is crucial for these media or platforms to function effectively and prevent the spread of misinformation and other potential misuse of LLMs. To tackle the problem of online detection, we develop an algorithm based on the techniques of sequential hypothesis testing by betting that not only builds upon and complements existing offline detection techniques but also enjoys statistical guarantees, which include a controlled false positive rate and the expected time to correctly identify a source as an LLM. Experiments were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

      Previous research has sought to enhance the graph reasoning capabilities of LLMs by supervised fine-tuning on synthetic graph data. While these led to specialized LLMs better at solving graph algorithm problems, we don't need LLMs for shortest path: we need generalization from synthetic graph data to real-world tasks with implicit graph structures. In this work, we propose to unlock generalizable learning of graph synthetic data with reinforcement learning. We first design solution-based and process-based rewards for synthetic graph problems: instead of rigid memorizing response patterns in direct fine-tuning, we posit that RL would help LLMs grasp the essentials underlying graph reasoning and alleviate overfitting. We employ RL algorithms such as GRPO and DPO, aligning both off-the-shelf LLMs and LLMs fine-tuned on synthetic graph data. We then compare them against existing settings on both in-domain synthetic tasks and out-of-domain real-world tasks with implicit graph structures such as multi-hop QA, structured planning, and more. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our RL recipe leads to statistically significant improvement on 5 datasets, with an average gain of 12.9\% over baseline settings. Further analysis reveals that process-based rewards consistently outperform solution-based rewards, mixing synthetic and real-world task data yields potential gains, while compositionality and explainable intermediate steps remains a critical challenge even after RL.

      Long context large language models (LLMs) are deployed in many real-world applications such as RAG, agent, and broad LLM-integrated applications. Given an instruction and a long context (e.g., documents, PDF files, webpages), a long context LLM can generate an output grounded in the provided context, aiming to provide more accurate, up-to-date, and verifiable outputs while reducing hallucinations and unsupported claims. This raises a research question: how to pinpoint the texts (e.g., sentences, passages, or paragraphs) in the context that contribute most to or are responsible for the generated output by an LLM? This process, which we call context traceback, has various real-world applications, such as 1) debugging LLM-based systems, 2) conducting post-attack forensic analysis for attacks (e.g., prompt injection attack, knowledge corruption attacks) to an LLM, and 3) highlighting knowledge sources to enhance the trust of users towards outputs generated by LLMs. When applied to context traceback for long context LLMs, existing feature attribution methods such as Shapley have sub-optimal performance and/or incur a large computational cost. In this work, we develop TracLLM, the first generic context traceback framework tailored to long context LLMs. Our framework can improve the effectiveness and efficiency of existing feature attribution methods. To improve the efficiency, we develop an informed search based algorithm in TracLLM. We also develop contribution score ensemble/denoising techniques to improve the accuracy of TracLLM.

      The use of large language models (LLMs) for relevance assessment in information retrieval has gained significant attention, with recent studies suggesting that LLM-based judgments provide comparable evaluations to human judgments. Notably, based on TREC 2024 data, Upadhyay et al. make a bold claim that LLM-based relevance assessments, such as those generated by the UMBRELA system, can fully replace traditional human relevance assessments in TREC-style evaluations. This paper critically examines this claim, highlighting practical and theoretical limitations that undermine the validity of this conclusion. First, we question whether the evidence provided by Upadhyay et al. really supports their claim, particularly if a test collection is used asa benchmark for future improvements. Second, through a submission deliberately intended to do so, we demonstrate the ease with which automatic evaluation metrics can be subverted, showing that systems designed to exploit these evaluations can achieve artificially high scores. Theoretical challenges -- such as the inherent narcissism of LLMs, the risk of overfitting to LLM-based metrics, and the potential degradation of future LLM performance -- must be addressed before LLM-based relevance assessments can be considered a viable replacement for human judgments.

Through systematic ablations, we demonstrate that bias-related computations are highly localized, often concentrated in a small subset of layers. Moreover, the identified components change across fine-tuning settings, including those unrelated to bias. Finally, we show that removing these components not only reduces biased outputs but also affects other NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition and linguistic acceptability judgment because of the sharing of important components with these tasks.

      Recent advances in automatic speech recognition (ASR) have combined speech encoders with large language models (LLMs) through projection, forming Speech LLMs with strong performance. However, adapting them to new domains remains challenging, especially in low-resource settings where paired speech-text data is scarce. We propose a text-only fine-tuning strategy for Speech LLMs using unpaired target-domain text without requiring additional audio. To preserve speech-text alignment, we introduce a real-time evaluation mechanism during fine-tuning. This enables effective domain adaptation while maintaining source-domain performance. Experiments on LibriSpeech, SlideSpeech, and Medical datasets show that our method achieves competitive recognition performance, with minimal degradation compared to full audio-text fine-tuning. It also improves generalization to new domains without catastrophic forgetting, highlighting the potential of text-only fine-tuning for low-resource domain adaptation of ASR.

      As LLMs become central to interactive applications, ranging from tutoring to mental health, the ability to express personality in culturally appropriate ways is increasingly important. While recent works have explored personality evaluation of LLMs, they largely overlook the interplay between culture and personality. To address this, we introduce CulturalPersonas, the first large-scale benchmark with human validation for evaluating LLMs' personality expression in culturally grounded, behaviorally rich contexts. Our dataset spans 3,000 scenario-based questions across six diverse countries, designed to elicit personality through everyday scenarios rooted in local values. We evaluate three LLMs, using both multiple-choice and open-ended response formats. Our results show that CulturalPersonas improves alignment with country-specific human personality distributions (over a 20% reduction in Wasserstein distance across models and countries) and elicits more expressive, culturally coherent outputs compared to existing benchmarks. CulturalPersonas surfaces meaningful modulated trait outputs in response to culturally grounded prompts, offering new directions for aligning LLMs to global norms of behavior. By bridging personality expression and cultural nuance, we envision that CulturalPersonas will pave the way for more socially intelligent and globally adaptive LLMs.

      Recent advances in agentic LLMs have demonstrated great capabilities in Verilog code generation. However, existing approaches either use LLM-assisted single-agent prompting or cooperation-only multi-agent learning, which will lead to: (i) Degeneration issue for single-agent learning: characterized by diminished error detection and correction capabilities; (ii) Error propagation in cooperation-only multi-agent learning: erroneous information from the former agent will be propagated to the latter through prompts, which can make the latter agents generate buggy code. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based coopetitive multi-agent prompting framework, in which the agents cannot collaborate with each other to form the generation pipeline, but also create a healthy competitive mechanism to improve the generating quality. Our experimental results show that the coopetitive multi-agent framework can effectively mitigate the degeneration risk and reduce the error propagation while improving code error correction capabilities, resulting in higher quality Verilog code generation. The effectiveness of our approach is validated through extensive experiments. On VerilogEval Machine and Human dataset, CoopetitiveV+GPT-4 achieves 99.2% and 99.1% pass@10 scores, respectively. While on RTLLM, CoopetitiveV+GPT-4 obtains 100% syntax and 99.9% functionality pass@5 scores.

      Hardware accelerators, especially those designed for tensor processing, have become ubiquitous in today's computing landscape. However, even with significant efforts in building compilers, programming these tensor accelerators remains challenging, leaving much of their potential underutilized. Recently, large language models (LLMs), trained on large amounts of code, have shown significant promise in code generation and optimization tasks, but generating low-resource languages like specialized tensor accelerator code still poses a significant challenge. We tackle this challenge with Autocomp, an approach that empowers accelerator programmers to leverage domain knowledge and hardware feedback to optimize code via an automated LLM-driven search. We accomplish this by: 1) formulating each optimization pass as a structured two-phase prompt, divided into planning and code generation phases, 2) inserting domain knowledge during planning via a concise and adaptable optimization menu, and 3) integrating correctness and performance metrics from hardware as feedback at each search iteration. Across three categories of representative workloads and two different accelerators, we demonstrate that Autocomp-optimized code runs 5.6x (GEMM) and 2.7x (convolution) faster than the vendor-provided library, and outperforms expert-level hand-tuned code by 1.4x (GEMM), 1.1x (convolution), and 1.3x (fine-grained linear algebra). Additionally, we demonstrate that optimization schedules generated from Autocomp can be reused across similar tensor operations, improving speedups by up to 24% under a fixed sample budget.

      This paper argues that a comprehensive vulnerability analysis is essential for building trustworthy Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (LLM-MAS). These systems, which consist of multiple LLM-powered agents working collaboratively, are increasingly deployed in high-stakes applications but face novel security threats due to their complex structures. While single-agent vulnerabilities are well-studied, LLM-MAS introduces unique attack surfaces through inter-agent communication, trust relationships, and tool integration that remain significantly underexplored. We present a systematic framework for vulnerability analysis of LLM-MAS that unifies diverse research. For each type of vulnerability, we define formal threat models grounded in practical attacker capabilities and illustrate them using real-world LLM-MAS applications. This formulation enables rigorous quantification of vulnerability across different architectures and provides a foundation for designing meaningful evaluation benchmarks. Our analysis reveals that LLM-MAS faces elevated risk due to compositional effects -- vulnerabilities in individual components can cascade through agent communication, creating threat models not present in single-agent systems. We conclude by identifying critical open challenges: (1) developing benchmarks specifically tailored to LLM-MAS vulnerability assessment, (2) considering new potential attacks specific to multi-agent architectures, and (3) implementing trust management systems that can enforce security in LLM-MAS. This research provides essential groundwork for future efforts to enhance LLM-MAS trustworthiness as these systems continue their expansion into critical applications.

      Recent progress in Language Models (LMs) has dramatically advanced the field of natural language processing (NLP), excelling at tasks like text generation, summarization, and question answering. However, their inference remains computationally expensive and energy intensive, especially in settings with limited hardware, power, or bandwidth. This makes it difficult to deploy LMs in mobile, edge, or cost sensitive environments. To address these challenges, recent approaches have introduced multi LLM intelligent model selection strategies that dynamically allocate computational resources based on query complexity -- using lightweight models for simpler queries and escalating to larger models only when necessary. This survey explores two complementary strategies for efficient LLM inference: (i) routing, which selects the most suitable model based on the query, and (ii) cascading or hierarchical inference (HI), which escalates queries through a sequence of models until a confident response is found. Both approaches aim to reduce computation by using lightweight models for simpler tasks while offloading only when needed. We provide a comparative analysis of these techniques across key performance metrics, discuss benchmarking efforts, and outline open challenges. Finally, we outline future research directions to enable faster response times, adaptive model selection based on task complexity, and scalable deployment across heterogeneous environments, making LLM based systems more efficient and accessible for real world applications.

      Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing scientific research, yet its growing integration into laboratory environments presents critical safety challenges. While large language models (LLMs) increasingly assist in tasks ranging from procedural guidance to autonomous experiment orchestration, an "illusion of understanding" may lead researchers to overestimate their reliability. Such overreliance is particularly dangerous in high-stakes laboratory settings, where failures in hazard identification or risk assessment can result in severe accidents. To address these concerns, we propose the Laboratory Safety Benchmark (LabSafety Bench), a comprehensive framework that evaluates large language models and vision language models (VLMs) on their ability to identify potential hazards, assess risks, and predict the consequences of unsafe actions in lab environments. LabSafety Bench comprises 765 multiple-choice questions aligned with US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) protocols, along with 404 realistic laboratory scenarios featuring dual evaluation tasks: the Hazards Identification Test and the Consequence Identification Test, with 3128 open-ended questions in total. Evaluations across eight proprietary models, seven open-weight LLMs, and four VLMs reveal that, despite advanced performance on structured assessments, no model achieves the safety threshold required for reliable operation -- none scoring above 70% on the Hazards Identification Test. Moreover, while proprietary models tend to excel in multiple-choice evaluations, their performance in open-ended, real-world scenario responses is comparable to that of open-source models. These findings underscore the urgent need for specialized evaluation frameworks to ensure the safe and responsible deployment of AI in laboratory settings.

      Understanding the reliability of large language models (LLMs) has recently garnered significant attention. Given LLMs' propensity to hallucinate, as well as their high sensitivity to prompt design, it is already challenging to predict the performance of an individual LLM. However, the problem becomes more complex for compound LLM systems such as cascades, where in addition to each model's standalone performance, we must understand how the error rates of different models interact. In this paper, we present a probabilistic model for the joint performance distribution of a sequence of LLMs, which enables a framework for rationally tuning the confidence thresholds of a LLM cascade using continuous optimization. Compared to selecting confidence thresholds using Bayesian optimization, our parametric Markov-copula model yields more favorable error-cost trade-offs, improving the area under the error-cost curve by 4.3% on average for cascades with $k\geq 3$ models. In the low-sample regime with $n \leq 30$ training examples, the performance improvement widens to 10.2%, suggesting that our framework's inductive assumptions about the interactions between the error rates of different LLMs enhance sample efficiency. Overall, our Markov-copula model provides a rational basis for tuning LLM cascade performance and points to the potential of probabilistic methods in analyzing systems of LLMs.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown high capabilities in several software development-related tasks such as program repair, documentation, code refactoring, debugging, and testing. However, training these models requires massive amount of data and significant computational resources. Adapters are specialized, small modules designed for parameter efficient fine-tuning of LLMs for specific tasks, domains, or applications without requiring extensive retraining of the entire model. These adapters offer a more efficient way to customize LLMs for particular needs, leveraging the pre-existing capabilities of the large model. Model (and adapter) merging have emerged as a technique to develop one model capable of multiple tasks, with minimal or no training required. Although model and adapter merging has shown promising performance in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision, its applicability to software engineering tasks remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of merged adapters within the context of software engineering, with a particular focus on the Automated Program Repair (APR) task, through our approach, MergeRepair. In particular, we merge multiple task-specific adapters using three different merging methods, including weight-averaging, ties, and dare-ties, and evaluate the performance of the merged adapter on the APR task. We introduce a continual merging approach, a novel method in which we sequentially merge the task-specific adapters where the order and weight of the merged adapters play a significant role. We further compare the performance of our approach with a baseline method consisting of equal-weight merging applied on parameters of different adapters, where all adapters are of equal importance.

      Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely adopted in various real-world applications. However, the control and optimization of multi-UAV systems remain a significant challenge, particularly in dynamic and constrained environments. This work explores the joint motion and communication control of multiple UAVs operating within integrated terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks that include high-altitude platform stations (HAPS). Specifically, we consider an aerial highway scenario in which UAVs must accelerate, decelerate, and change lanes to avoid collisions and maintain overall traffic flow. Different from existing studies, we propose a novel hierarchical and collaborative method based on large language models (LLMs). In our approach, an LLM deployed on the HAPS performs UAV access control, while another LLM onboard each UAV handles motion planning and control. This LLM-based framework leverages the rich knowledge embedded in pre-trained models to enable both high-level strategic planning and low-level tactical decisions. This knowledge-driven paradigm holds great potential for the development of next-generation 3D aerial highway systems. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed collaborative LLM-based method achieves higher system rewards, lower operational costs, and significantly reduced UAV collision rates compared to baseline approaches.

      Recent work on large language models (LLMs) has increasingly focused on post-training and alignment with datasets curated to enhance instruction following, world knowledge, and specialized skills. However, most post-training datasets used in leading open- and closed-source LLMs remain inaccessible to the public, with limited information about their construction process. This lack of transparency has motivated the recent development of open-source post-training corpora. While training on these open alternatives can yield performance comparable to that of leading models, systematic comparisons remain challenging due to the significant computational cost of conducting them rigorously at scale, and are therefore largely absent. As a result, it remains unclear how specific samples, task types, or curation strategies influence downstream performance when assessing data quality. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive side-by-side analysis of two prominent open post-training datasets: Tulu-3-SFT-Mix and SmolTalk. Using the Magpie framework, we annotate each sample with detailed quality metrics, including turn structure (single-turn vs. multi-turn), task category, input quality, and response quality, and we derive statistics that reveal structural and qualitative similarities and differences between the two datasets. Based on these insights, we design a principled curation recipe that produces a new data mixture, TuluTalk, which contains 14% fewer samples than either source dataset while matching or exceeding their performance on key benchmarks. Our findings offer actionable insights for constructing more effective post-training datasets that improve model performance within practical resource limits. To support future research, we publicly release both the annotated source datasets and our curated TuluTalk mixture.

      6G networks have become increasingly complicated due to novel network architecture and newly emerging signal processing and transmission techniques, leading to significant burdens to 6G network management. Large language models (LLMs) have recently been considered a promising technique to equip 6G networks with AI-native intelligence. Different from most existing studies that only consider a single LLM, this work involves a multi-LLM debate-based scheme for 6G network management, where multiple LLMs can collaboratively improve the initial solution sequentially. Considering the complex nature of 6G domain, we propose a novel hierarchical debate scheme: LLMs will first debate the sub-task decomposition, and then debate each subtask step-by-step. Such a hierarchical approach can significantly reduce the overall debate difficulty by sub-task decomposition, aligning well with the complex nature of 6G networks and ensuring the final solution qualities. In addition, to better evaluate the proposed technique, we have defined a novel dataset named 6GPlan, including 110 complex 6G network management tasks and 5000 keyword solutions. Finally, the experiments show that the proposed hierarchical debate can significantly improve performance compared to baseline techniques, e.g. more than 30% coverage rate and global recall rate improvement.

      This paper introduces TemporalVLM, a video large language model (video LLM) capable of effective temporal reasoning and fine-grained understanding in long videos. At the core, our approach includes a visual encoder for mapping a long-term input video into features which are time-aware and contain both local and global cues. In particular, it first divides the input video into short-term clips, which are jointly encoded with their timestamps into time-sensitive local features. Next, the local features are passed through a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) module for global feature aggregation. The extracted time-aware and multi-level features are important for accurate temporal reasoning and fine-grained understanding in long videos. Moreover, to facilitate the evaluation of TemporalVLM, we present a large-scale long video dataset of industry assembly processes, namely IndustryASM, which consists of videos recorded on factory floors with actions and timestamps annotated by industrial engineers for time and motion studies and temporal action segmentation evaluation. Finally, extensive experiments on datasets of long videos, including TimeIT and IndustryASM, show that TemporalVLM achieves superior performance than previous methods across temporal reasoning and fine-grained understanding tasks, namely dense video captioning, temporal video grounding, video highlight detection, and temporal action segmentation. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to incorporate LSTMs into video LLMs.

      In this contribution, we examine the capability of private GPTs to automatically generate executable test code based on requirements. More specifically, we use acceptance criteria as input, formulated as part of epics, or stories, which are typically used in modern development processes. This gives product owners, or business intelligence, respectively, a way to directly produce testable criteria through the use of LLMs. We explore the quality of the so-produced tests in two ways: i) directly by letting the LLM generate code from requirements, ii) through an intermediate step using Gherkin syntax. As a result, it turns out that the two-step procedure yields better results -where we define better in terms of human readability and best coding practices, i.e. lines of code and use of additional libraries typically used in testing. Concretely, we evaluate prompt effectiveness across two scenarios: a simple "Hello World" program and a digit classification model, showing that structured prompts lead to higher-quality test outputs.

      Electronic design engineers often struggle to efficiently access relevant information for tasks like design verification and technology development. While large language models (LLMs) can enhance productivity as conversational agents, pre-trained open-source LLMs lack domain-specific knowledge for Electronic Design Automation (EDA). In a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) context, LLMs rely on external context but may still produce inaccurate responses. Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning (RAFT) improves LLM performance, but acquiring labeled question/answer (Q/A) data in EDA is difficult. To address this, we propose using synthetic Q/A datasets to enhance LLMs with RAFT. Our results show that RAFT with synthetic data significantly boosts LLM performance for RAG-based EDA tasks. We also investigate the impact of using real user questions as Retrieval-Augmented Few-Shot (RAFS) examples for synthetic data generation. Additionally, we implement secure access control to ensure sensitive information is only accessible to authorized personnel. Finally, we assess the risk of data leakage and unintended memorization during fine-tuning with synthetic data, providing practical insights.

      We present the design and implementation of a new lifetime-aware tensor offloading framework for GPU memory expansion using low-cost PCIe-based solid-state drives (SSDs). Our framework, TERAIO, is developed explicitly for large language model (LLM) training with multiple GPUs and multiple SSDs. Its design is driven by our observation that the active tensors take only a small fraction (1.7% on average) of allocated GPU memory in each LLM training iteration, the inactive tensors are usually large and will not be used for a long period of time, creating ample opportunities for offloading/prefetching tensors to/from slow SSDs without stalling the GPU training process. TERAIO accurately estimates the lifetime (active period of time in GPU memory) of each tensor with the profiling of the first few iterations in the training process. With the tensor lifetime analysis, TERAIO will generate an optimized tensor offloading/prefetching plan and integrate it into the compiled LLM program via PyTorch. TERAIO has a runtime tensor migration engine to execute the offloading/prefetching plan via GPUDirect storage, which allows direct tensor migration between GPUs and SSDs for alleviating the CPU bottleneck and maximizing the SSD bandwidth utilization. In comparison with state-of-the-art studies such as ZeRO-Offload and ZeRO-Infinity, we show that TERAIO improves the training performance of various LLMs by 1.47x on average, and achieves 80.7% of the ideal performance assuming unlimited GPU memory.

      User intent classification is an important task in information retrieval. Previously, user intents were classified manually and automatically; the latter helped to avoid hand labelling of large datasets. Recent studies explored whether LLMs can reliably determine user intent. However, researchers have recognized the limitations of using generative LLMs for classification tasks. In this study, we empirically compare user intent classification into informational, navigational, and transactional categories, using weak supervision and LLMs. Specifically, we evaluate LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct and LLaMA-3.1-70B-Instruct for in-context learning and LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct for fine-tuning, comparing their performance to an established baseline classifier trained using weak supervision (ORCAS-I). Our results indicate that while LLMs outperform weak supervision in recall, they continue to struggle with precision, which shows the need for improved methods to balance both metrics effectively.

      Existing safety assurance research has primarily focused on training-phase alignment to instill safe behaviors into LLMs. However, recent studies have exposed these methods' susceptibility to diverse jailbreak attacks. Concurrently, inference scaling has significantly advanced LLM reasoning capabilities but remains unexplored in the context of safety assurance. Addressing this gap, our work pioneers inference scaling for robust and effective LLM safety against emerging threats. We reveal that conventional inference scaling techniques, despite their success in reasoning tasks, perform poorly in safety contexts, even falling short of basic approaches like Best-of-N Sampling. We attribute this inefficiency to a newly identified challenge, the exploration--efficiency dilemma, arising from the high computational overhead associated with frequent process reward model (PRM) evaluations. To overcome this dilemma, we propose SAFFRON, a novel inference scaling paradigm tailored explicitly for safety assurance. Central to our approach is the introduction of a multifurcation reward model (MRM) that significantly reduces the required number of reward model evaluations. To operationalize this paradigm, we further propose: (i) a partial supervision training objective for MRM, (ii) a conservative exploration constraint to prevent out-of-distribution explorations, and (iii) a Trie-based key--value caching strategy that facilitates cache sharing across sequences during tree search. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method. Additionally, we publicly release our trained multifurcation reward model (Saffron-1) and the accompanying token-level safety reward dataset (Safety4M) to accelerate future research in LLM safety. Our code, model, and data are publicly available at https://github.com/q-rz/saffron , and our project homepage is at https://q-rz.github.io/p/saffron .

      The application scope of Large Language Models (LLMs) continues to expand, leading to increasing interest in personalized LLMs that align with human values. However, aligning these models with individual values raises significant safety concerns, as certain values may correlate with harmful information. In this paper, we identify specific safety risks associated with value-aligned LLMs and investigate the psychological principles behind these challenges. Our findings reveal two key insights. (1) Value-aligned LLMs are more prone to harmful behavior compared to non-fine-tuned models and exhibit slightly higher risks in traditional safety evaluations than other fine-tuned models. (2) These safety issues arise because value-aligned LLMs genuinely generate text according to the aligned values, which can amplify harmful outcomes. Using a dataset with detailed safety categories, we find significant correlations between value alignment and safety risks, supported by psychological hypotheses. This study offers insights into the "black box" of value alignment and proposes in-context alignment methods to enhance the safety of value-aligned LLMs.
