      Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) achieves robust speech recognition in noisy environments by combining auditory and visual information. However, recent Large Language Model (LLM) based AVSR systems incur high computational costs due to the high temporal resolution of audio-visual speech processed by LLMs. In this work, we introduce an efficient multimodal speech LLM framework that minimizes token length while preserving essential linguistic content. Our approach employs an early AV-fusion module for streamlined feature integration, an audio-visual speech Q-Former that dynamically allocates tokens based on input duration, and a refined query allocation strategy with a speech rate predictor to adjust token allocation according to speaking speed of each audio sample. Extensive experiments on the LRS3 dataset show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with a WER of 0.72% while using only 3.5 tokens per second. Moreover, our approach not only reduces token usage by 86% compared to the previous multimodal speech LLM framework, but also improves computational efficiency by reducing FLOPs by 35.7%.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Recent advances in LLMs have enabled their use as autonomous agents across a range of tasks, yet they continue to struggle with formulating and adhering to coherent long-term strategies. In this paper, we investigate whether LLM agents can self-improve when placed in environments that explicitly challenge their strategic planning abilities. Using the board game Settlers of Catan, accessed through the open-source Catanatron framework, we benchmark a progression of LLM-based agents, from a simple game-playing agent to systems capable of autonomously rewriting their own prompts and their player agent's code. We introduce a multi-agent architecture in which specialized roles (Analyzer, Researcher, Coder, and Player) collaborate to iteratively analyze gameplay, research new strategies, and modify the agent's logic or prompt. By comparing manually crafted agents to those evolved entirely by LLMs, we evaluate how effectively these systems can diagnose failure and adapt over time. Our results show that self-evolving agents, particularly when powered by models like Claude 3.7 and GPT-4o, outperform static baselines by autonomously adopting their strategies, passing along sample behavior to game-playing agents, and demonstrating adaptive reasoning over multiple iterations.

      Conventional biomedical research is increasingly labor-intensive due to the exponential growth of scientific literature and datasets. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has the potential to revolutionize this process by automating various steps. Still, significant challenges remain, including the need for multidisciplinary expertise, logicality of experimental design, and performance measurements. This paper introduces BioResearcher, the first end-to-end automated system designed to streamline the entire biomedical research process involving dry lab experiments. BioResearcher employs a modular multi-agent architecture, integrating specialized agents for search, literature processing, experimental design, and programming. By decomposing complex tasks into logically related sub-tasks and utilizing a hierarchical learning approach, BioResearcher effectively addresses the challenges of multidisciplinary requirements and logical complexity. Furthermore, BioResearcher incorporates an LLM-based reviewer for in-process quality control and introduces novel evaluation metrics to assess the quality and automation of experimental protocols. BioResearcher successfully achieves an average execution success rate of 63.07% across eight previously unmet research objectives. The generated protocols, on average, outperform typical agent systems by 22.0% on five quality metrics. The system demonstrates significant potential to reduce researchers' workloads and accelerate biomedical discoveries, paving the way for future innovations in automated research systems.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as promising tools for knowledge tracing (KT) due to their strong reasoning and generalization abilities. While recent LLM-based KT methods have proposed new prompt formats, they struggle to represent the full interaction histories of example learners within a single prompt during in-context learning (ICL), resulting in limited scalability and high computational cost under token constraints. In this work, we present \textit{LLM-based Option-weighted Knowledge Tracing (LOKT)}, a simple yet effective framework that encodes the interaction histories of example learners in context as \textit{textual categorical option weights (TCOW)}. TCOW are semantic labels (e.g., ``inadequate'') assigned to the options selected by learners when answering questions, enhancing the interpretability of LLMs. Experiments on multiple-choice datasets show that LOKT outperforms existing non-LLM and LLM-based KT models in both cold-start and warm-start settings. Moreover, LOKT enables scalable and cost-efficient inference, achieving strong performance even under strict token constraints.

      Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs), achieving state-of-the-art performance on tasks with structured, verifiable answers. Applying RLVR to Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) presents significant opportunities but is complicated by the broader, heterogeneous nature of vision-language tasks that demand nuanced visual, logical, and spatial capabilities. As such, training MLLMs using RLVR on multiple datasets could be beneficial but creates challenges with conflicting objectives from interaction among diverse datasets, highlighting the need for optimal dataset mixture strategies to improve generalization and reasoning. We introduce a systematic post-training framework for Multimodal LLM RLVR, featuring a rigorous data mixture problem formulation and benchmark implementation. Specifically, (1) We developed a multimodal RLVR framework for multi-dataset post-training by curating a dataset that contains different verifiable vision-language problems and enabling multi-domain online RL learning with different verifiable rewards; (2) We proposed a data mixture strategy that learns to predict the RL fine-tuning outcome from the data mixture distribution, and consequently optimizes the best mixture. Comprehensive experiments showcase that multi-domain RLVR training, when combined with mixture prediction strategies, can significantly boost MLLM general reasoning capacities. Our best mixture improves the post-trained model's accuracy on out-of-distribution benchmarks by an average of 5.24% compared to the same model post-trained with uniform data mixture, and by a total of 20.74% compared to the pre-finetuning baseline.

      We have witnessed that strong LLMs like Qwen-Math, MiMo, and Phi-4 possess immense reasoning potential inherited from the pre-training stage. With reinforcement learning (RL), these models can improve dramatically on reasoning tasks. Recent studies have shown that even RL on a single problem can unleash these models' reasoning capabilities. However, RL is not only expensive but also unstable. Even one-shot RL requires hundreds of GPU hours. This raises a critical question: Is there a more efficient way to unleash the reasoning potential of these powerful base LLMs? In this work, we demonstrate that Critique Fine-Tuning (CFT) on only one problem can effectively unleash the reasoning potential of LLMs. Our method constructs critique data by collecting diverse model-generated solutions to a single problem and using teacher LLMs to provide detailed critiques. We fine-tune Qwen and Llama family models, ranging from 1.5B to 14B parameters, on the CFT data and observe significant performance gains across diverse reasoning tasks. For example, with just 5 GPU hours of training, Qwen-Math-7B-CFT show an average improvement of 15% on six math benchmarks and 16% on three logic reasoning benchmarks. These results are comparable to or even surpass the results from RL with 20x less compute. Ablation studies reveal the robustness of one-shot CFT across different prompt problems. These results highlight one-shot CFT as a simple, general, and compute-efficient approach to unleashing the reasoning capabilities of modern LLMs.

      WiFi networks have achieved remarkable success in enabling seamless communication and data exchange worldwide. The IEEE 802.11be standard, known as WiFi 7, introduces Multi-Link Operation (MLO), a groundbreaking feature that enables devices to establish multiple simultaneous connections across different bands and channels. While MLO promises substantial improvements in network throughput and latency reduction, it presents significant challenges in channel allocation, particularly in dense network environments. Current research has predominantly focused on performance analysis and throughput optimization within static WiFi 7 network configurations. In contrast, this paper addresses the dynamic channel allocation problem in dense WiFi 7 networks with MLO capabilities. We formulate this challenge as a combinatorial optimization problem, leveraging a novel network performance analysis mechanism. Given the inherent lack of prior network information, we model the problem within a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework to enable online learning of optimal channel allocations. Our proposed Best-Arm Identification-enabled Monte Carlo Tree Search (BAI-MCTS) algorithm includes rigorous theoretical analysis, providing upper bounds for both sample complexity and error probability. To further reduce sample complexity and enhance generalizability across diverse network scenarios, we put forth LLM-BAI-MCTS, an intelligent algorithm for the dynamic channel allocation problem by integrating the Large Language Model (LLM) into the BAI-MCTS algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the BAI-MCTS algorithm achieves a convergence rate approximately $50.44\%$ faster than the state-of-the-art algorithms when reaching $98\%$ of the optimal value. Notably, the convergence rate of the LLM-BAI-MCTS algorithm increases by over $63.32\%$ in dense networks.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      With the growing adoption of reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) for aligning large language models (LLMs), the risk of backdoor installation during alignment has increased, leading to unintended and harmful behaviors. Existing backdoor triggers are typically limited to fixed word patterns, making them detectable during data cleaning and easily removable post-poisoning. In this work, we explore the use of prompt-specific paraphrases as backdoor triggers, enhancing their stealth and resistance to removal during LLM alignment. We propose AdvBDGen, an adversarially fortified generative fine-tuning framework that automatically generates prompt-specific backdoors that are effective, stealthy, and transferable across models. AdvBDGen employs a generator-discriminator pair, fortified by an adversary, to ensure the installability and stealthiness of backdoors. It enables the crafting and successful installation of complex triggers using as little as 3% of the fine-tuning data. Once installed, these backdoors can jailbreak LLMs during inference, demonstrate improved stability against perturbations compared to traditional constant triggers, and are more challenging to remove. These findings underscore an urgent need for the research community to develop more robust defenses against adversarial backdoor threats in LLM alignment.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Neuro-symbolic approaches combining large language models (LLMs) with solvers excels in logical reasoning problems need long reasoning chains. In this paradigm, LLMs serve as translators, converting natural language reasoning problems into formal logic formulas. Then reliable symbolic solvers return correct solutions. Despite their success, we find that LLMs, as translators, struggle to handle lexical diversification, a common linguistic phenomenon, indicating that LLMs as logic translators are unreliable in real-world scenarios. Moreover, existing logical reasoning benchmarks lack lexical diversity, failing to challenge LLMs' ability to translate such text and thus obscuring this issue. In this work, we propose SCALe, a benchmark designed to address this significant gap through **logic-invariant lexical diversification**. By using LLMs to transform original benchmark datasets into lexically diversified but logically equivalent versions, we evaluate LLMs' ability to consistently map diverse expressions to uniform logical symbols on these new datasets. Experiments using SCALe further confirm that current LLMs exhibit deficiencies in this capability. Building directly on the deficiencies identified through our benchmark, we propose a new method, MenTaL, to address this limitation. This method guides LLMs to first construct a table unifying diverse expressions before performing translation. Applying MenTaL through in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) significantly improves the performance of LLM translators on lexically diversified text.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Compound Al Systems (CAIS) is an emerging paradigm that integrates large language models (LLMs) with external components, such as retrievers, agents, tools, and orchestrators, to overcome the limitations of standalone models in tasks requiring memory, reasoning, real-time grounding, and multimodal understanding. These systems enable more capable and context-aware behaviors by composing multiple specialized modules into cohesive workflows. Despite growing adoption in both academia and industry, the CAIS landscape remains fragmented, lacking a unified framework for analysis, taxonomy, and evaluation. In this survey, we define the concept of CAIS, propose a multi-dimensional taxonomy based on component roles and orchestration strategies, and analyze four foundational paradigms: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LLM Agents, Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), and orchestration-centric architectures. We review representative systems, compare design trade-offs, and summarize evaluation methodologies across these paradigms. Finally, we identify key challenges-including scalability, interoperability, benchmarking, and coordination-and outline promising directions for future research. This survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive foundation for understanding, developing, and advancing the next generation of system-level artificial intelligence.

      Evaluating machine translation (MT) quality for under-resourced African languages remains a significant challenge, as existing metrics often suffer from limited language coverage and poor performance in low-resource settings. While recent efforts, such as AfriCOMET, have addressed some of the issues, they are still constrained by small evaluation sets, a lack of publicly available training data tailored to African languages, and inconsistent performance in extremely low-resource scenarios. In this work, we introduce SSA-MTE, a large-scale human-annotated MT evaluation (MTE) dataset covering 13 African language pairs from the News domain, with over 63,000 sentence-level annotations from a diverse set of MT systems. Based on this data, we develop SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE, improved reference-based and reference-free evaluation metrics. We also benchmark prompting-based approaches using state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude. Our experimental results show that SSA-COMET models significantly outperform AfriCOMET and are competitive with the strongest LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro) evaluated in our study, particularly on low-resource languages such as Twi, Luo, and Yoruba.

      Traditional approaches for designing analog circuits are time-consuming and require significant human expertise. Existing automation efforts using methods like Bayesian Optimization (BO) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are sub-optimal and costly to generalize across different topologies and technology nodes. In our work, we introduce a novel approach, LEDRO, utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) in conjunction with optimization techniques to iteratively refine the design space for analog circuit sizing. LEDRO is highly generalizable compared to other RL and BO baselines, eliminating the need for design annotation or model training for different topologies or technology nodes. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our proposed framework and baseline on 22 different Op-Amp topologies across four FinFET technology nodes. Results demonstrate the superior performance of LEDRO as it outperforms our best baseline by an average of 13% FoM improvement with 2.15x speed-up on low complexity Op-Amps and 48% FoM improvement with 1.7x speed-up on high complexity Op-Amps. This highlights LEDRO's effective performance, efficiency, and generalizability.

      What makes a difference in the post-training of LLMs? We investigate the training patterns of different layers in large language models (LLMs) through the lens of the gradient. We are specifically interested in how fast vs. slow thinking affects the layer-wise gradients, given the recent popularity of training LLMs on reasoning paths such as chain-of-thoughts (CoT) and process rewards. In our study, fast thinking without CoT leads to larger gradients and larger differences of gradients across layers than slow thinking (Detailed CoT), indicating the learning stability brought by the latter. Additionally, we study whether the gradient patterns can reflect the correctness of responses when training different LLMs using slow vs. fast thinking paths. The results show that the gradients of slow thinking can distinguish correct and irrelevant reasoning paths. As a comparison, we conduct similar gradient analyses on non-reasoning knowledge learning tasks, on which, however, trivially increasing the response length does not lead to similar behaviors of slow thinking. Our study strengthens fundamental understandings of LLM training and sheds novel insights on its efficiency and stability, which pave the way towards building a generalizable System-2 agent.

      Traditional offline evaluation methods for recommender systems struggle to capture the complexity of modern platforms due to sparse behavioural signals, noisy data, and limited modelling of user personality traits. While simulation frameworks can generate synthetic data to address these gaps, existing methods fail to replicate behavioural diversity, limiting their effectiveness. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Personality-driven User Behaviour Simulator (PUB), an LLM-based simulation framework that integrates the Big Five personality traits to model personalised user behaviour. PUB dynamically infers user personality from behavioural logs (e.g., ratings, reviews) and item metadata, then generates synthetic interactions that preserve statistical fidelity to real-world data. Experiments on the Amazon review datasets show that logs generated by PUB closely align with real user behaviour and reveal meaningful associations between personality traits and recommendation outcomes. These results highlight the potential of the personality-driven simulator to advance recommender system evaluation, offering scalable, controllable, high-fidelity alternatives to resource-intensive real-world experiments.

Furthermore, we demonstrate the value of hdl2v in enhancing LLM Verilog generation by improving performance of a 32 billion-parameter open-weight model by up to 23% (pass@10) in VerilogEvalV2, without utilizing any data augmentation or knowledge distillation from larger models. We also show hdl2v's ability to boost the performance of a data augmentation-based fine-tuning approach by 63%.

      Discourse particles are crucial elements that subtly shape the meaning of text. These words, often polyfunctional, give rise to nuanced and often quite disparate semantic/discourse effects, as exemplified by the diverse uses of the particle "just" (e.g., exclusive, temporal, emphatic). This work investigates the capacity of LLMs to distinguish the fine-grained senses of English "just", a well-studied example in formal semantics, using data meticulously created and labeled by expert linguists. Our findings reveal that while LLMs exhibit some ability to differentiate between broader categories, they struggle to fully capture more subtle nuances, highlighting a gap in their understanding of discourse particles.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Neural machine translation (NMT) systems typically employ maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding to select the highest-scoring translation from the distribution mass. However, recent evidence highlights the inadequacy of MAP decoding, often resulting in low-quality or even pathological hypotheses -- the decoding objective is not aligned with real-world translation quality. This paper proposes calibrating hypothesis likelihoods with translation quality from a distribution view by directly optimizing their Pearson correlation -- thereby enhancing the effectiveness of translation decoding. With our method, translation on large language models (LLMs) improves substantially after limited training (2K instances per direction). This improvement is orthogonal to those achieved through supervised fine-tuning, leading to substantial gains across a broad range of metrics and human evaluations -- even when applied to top-performing translation-specialized LLMs fine-tuned on high-quality translation data, such as Tower, or when compared to recent preference optimization methods, like CPO. Moreover, the calibrated translation likelihood can directly serve as a strong proxy for translation quality, closely approximating or even surpassing some state-of-the-art translation quality estimation models, like CometKiwi. Lastly, our in-depth analysis demonstrates that calibration enhances the effectiveness of MAP decoding, thereby enabling greater efficiency in real-world deployment. The resulting state-of-the-art translation model, which covers 10 languages, along with the accompanying code and human evaluation data, has been released to the community: https://github.com/moore3930/calibrating-llm-mt.

      Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) generation holds significant promise for automating cloud infrastructure provisioning. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising opportunity to democratize IaC development by generating deployable infrastructure templates from natural language descriptions, but current evaluation focuses on syntactic correctness while ignoring deployability, the fatal measure of IaC template utility. We address this gap through two contributions: (1) IaCGen, an LLM-based deployability-centric framework that uses iterative feedback mechanism to generate IaC templates, and (2) DPIaC-Eval, a deployability-centric IaC template benchmark consists of 153 real-world scenarios that can evaluate syntax, deployment, user intent, and security. Our evaluation reveals that state-of-the-art LLMs initially performed poorly, with Claude-3.5 and Claude-3.7 achieving only 30.2% and 26.8% deployment success on the first attempt respectively. However, IaCGen transforms this performance dramatically: all evaluated models reach over 90% passItr@25, with Claude-3.5 and Claude-3.7 achieving 98% success rate. Despite these improvements, critical challenges remain in user intent alignment (25.2% accuracy) and security compliance (8.4% pass rate), highlighting areas requiring continued research. Our work provides the first comprehensive assessment of deployability-centric IaC template generation and establishes a foundation for future research.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant performance gains via scaling up model sizes and/or data. However, recent evidence suggests diminishing returns from such approaches, motivating scaling the computation spent at inference time. Existing inference-time scaling methods, usually with reward models, cast the task as a search problem, which tends to be vulnerable to reward hacking as a consequence of approximation errors in reward models. In this paper, we instead cast inference-time scaling as a probabilistic inference task and leverage sampling-based techniques to explore the typical set of the state distribution of a state-space model with an approximate likelihood, rather than optimize for its mode directly. We propose a novel inference-time scaling approach by adapting particle-based Monte Carlo methods to this task. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that our methods have a 4-16x better scaling rate over our deterministic search counterparts on various challenging mathematical reasoning tasks. Using our approach, we show that Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B-Instruct can surpass GPT-4o accuracy in only 4 rollouts, while Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct scales to o1 level accuracy in only 32 rollouts. Our work not only presents an effective method to inference-time scaling, but also connects the rich literature in probabilistic inference with inference-time scaling of LLMs to develop more robust algorithms in future work.

      Can large language models (LLMs) accurately simulate the next web action of a specific user? While LLMs have shown promising capabilities in generating ``believable'' human behaviors, evaluating their ability to mimic real user behaviors remains an open challenge, largely due to the lack of high-quality, publicly available datasets that capture both the observable actions and the internal reasoning of an actual human user. To address this gap, we introduce OPERA, a novel dataset of Observation, Persona, Rationale, and Action collected from real human participants during online shopping sessions. OPERA is the first public dataset that comprehensively captures: user personas, browser observations, fine-grained web actions, and self-reported just-in-time rationales. We developed both an online questionnaire and a custom browser plugin to gather this dataset with high fidelity. Using OPERA, we establish the first benchmark to evaluate how well current LLMs can predict a specific user's next action and rationale with a given persona and <observation, action, rationale> history. This dataset lays the groundwork for future research into LLM agents that aim to act as personalized digital twins for human.

      Recent research shows that LLMs can simulate ``believable'' human behaviors to power LLM agents via prompt-only methods. In this work, we focus on evaluating LLM's objective ``accuracy'' rather than the subjective ``believability'' in simulating human behavior, leveraging a large-scale, real-world dataset collected from customers' online shopping actions. We present the first comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, Llama, and Claude) on the task of web shopping action generation. Our results show that out-of-the-box LLM-generated actions are often misaligned with actual human behavior, whereas fine-tuning LLMs on real-world behavioral data substantially improves their ability to generate accurate actions compared to prompt-only methods. Furthermore, incorporating synthesized reasonings into model training leads to additional performance gains, demonstrating the value of explicit rationale in behavior modeling.

      Recent calls for pluralistic alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) encourage adapting models to diverse user preferences. However, most prior work on personalized reward models heavily rely on additional identity information, such as demographic details or a predefined set of preference categories. To this end, we introduce SynthesizeMe, an approach to inducing synthetic user personas from user interactions for personalized reward modeling. SynthesizeMe first generates and verifies reasoning to explain user preferences, then induces synthetic user personas from that reasoning, and finally filters to informative prior user interactions in order to build personalized prompts for a particular user. We show that using SynthesizeMe induced prompts improves personalized LLM-as-a-judge accuracy by 4.4% on Chatbot Arena. Combining SynthesizeMe derived prompts with a reward model achieves top performance on PersonalRewardBench: a new curation of user-stratified interactions with chatbots collected from 854 users of Chatbot Arena and PRISM.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing, demonstrating impressive capabilities across diverse tasks. However, deploying these models introduces critical risks related to intellectual property violations and potential misuse, particularly as adversaries can imitate these models to steal services or generate misleading outputs. We specifically focus on model stealing attacks, as they are highly relevant to proprietary LLMs and pose a serious threat to their security, revenue, and ethical deployment. While various watermarking techniques have emerged to mitigate these risks, it remains unclear how far the community and industry have progressed in developing and deploying watermarks in LLMs. To bridge this gap, we aim to develop a comprehensive systematization for watermarks in LLMs by 1) presenting a detailed taxonomy for watermarks in LLMs, 2) proposing a novel intellectual property classifier to explore the effectiveness and impacts of watermarks on LLMs under both attack and attack-free environments, 3) analyzing the limitations of existing watermarks in LLMs, and 4) discussing practical challenges and potential future directions for watermarks in LLMs. Through extensive experiments, we show that despite promising research outcomes and significant attention from leading companies and community to deploy watermarks, these techniques have yet to reach their full potential in real-world applications due to their unfavorable impacts on model utility of LLMs and downstream tasks. Our findings provide an insightful understanding of watermarks in LLMs, highlighting the need for practical watermarks solutions tailored to LLM deployment.

We extended the Llama-3.2 tokenizer to incorporate language- and culture-specific knowledge, which also enables faster training and inference. There was a lack of benchmarking datasets to benchmark LLMs for Bangla. To address this gap, we developed five benchmarking datasets. We benchmarked various LLMs, including TituLLMs, and demonstrated that TituLLMs outperforms its initial multilingual versions. However, this is not always the case, highlighting the complexities of language adaptation. Our work lays the groundwork for adapting existing multilingual open models to other low-resource languages.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Last few years have seen unprecedented advances in capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). These advancements promise to benefit a vast array of application domains. However, due to their immense size, performing inference with LLMs is both costly and slow. Consequently, a plethora of recent work has proposed strategies to enhance inference efficiency, e.g., quantization, pruning, and caching. These acceleration strategies reduce the inference cost and latency, often by several factors, while maintaining much of the predictive performance measured via common benchmarks. In this work, we explore another critical aspect of LLM performance: demographic bias in model generations due to inference acceleration optimizations. Using a wide range of metrics, we probe bias in model outputs from a number of angles. Analysis of outputs before and after inference acceleration shows significant change in bias. Worryingly, these bias effects are complex and unpredictable. A combination of an acceleration strategy and bias type may show little bias change in one model but may lead to a large effect in another. Our results highlight a need for in-depth and case-by-case evaluation of model bias after it has been modified to accelerate inference.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled near-human performance on software coding benchmarks, but their effectiveness in RTL code generation remains limited due to the scarcity of high-quality training data. While prior efforts have fine-tuned LLMs for RTL tasks, they do not fundamentally overcome the data bottleneck and lack support for test-time scaling due to their non-reasoning nature. In this work, we introduce ScaleRTL, the first reasoning LLM for RTL coding that scales up both high-quality reasoning data and test-time compute. Specifically, we curate a diverse set of long chain-of-thought reasoning traces averaging 56K tokens each, resulting in a dataset of 3.5B tokens that captures rich RTL knowledge. Fine-tuning a general-purpose reasoning model on this corpus yields ScaleRTL that is capable of deep RTL reasoning. Subsequently, we further enhance the performance of ScaleRTL through a novel test-time scaling strategy that extends the reasoning process via iteratively reflecting on and self-correcting previous reasoning steps. Experimental results show that ScaleRTL achieves state-of-the-art performance on VerilogEval and RTLLM, outperforming 18 competitive baselines by up to 18.4% on VerilogEval and 12.7% on RTLLM.

      Large language models (LLMs) are achieving significant progress almost every moment now. Many advanced techniques have been introduced and widely accepted, like retrieval-augmentation generation (RAG), agents, and tools. Tools can query the database to answer questions from structured data files or perform groupings or other statistics. This unlocks huge opportunities, such as it can answer any question, but also poses threats, such as safety, because there is no control over the commands that are created. We would like to discuss whether we can create a new method that improves answers based on dataset/database via some interpretable ML methods, namely enhanced association rules. The advantage would be if the method can be also used in some safe technique like RAG. Association rules have a sound history. Since the introduction of CN2 and aproiri, many enhancements have been made. In parallel, enhanced association rules have been introduced and evolved over the last 40 years. The general problem is typically that there are too many rules. There are some techniques for handling it, but when LLM emerged, it turned out to be the best use case for the RAG technique for LLMs. We proposed a method that generates a ruleset based on defined knowledge patterns, then converts rules into text form via a rule-to-text converter, and includes the result as an RAG into LLM. We compared this method with ChatGPT (even with using agents) and we have discovered a significant improvement in answering questions based on the dataset. We have also tried several strategies how much rules to generate. We found this improvement interesting. Moreover, it can also be improved in many ways as future work, like incorporating other patterns, the use of rule mining as an agent, and many others.

      Automatic evaluation methods based on large language models (LLMs) are emerging as the standard tool for assessing the instruction-following abilities of LLM-based agents. The most common method in this paradigm, pairwise comparisons with a baseline model, critically depends on the assumption of transitive preferences. However, the validity of this assumption remains largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate the presence of non-transitivity within the AlpacaEval framework and analyze its effects on model rankings. We find that LLM judges exhibit non-transitive preferences, leading to rankings that are sensitive to the choice of the baseline model. To mitigate this issue, we show that round-robin tournaments combined with Bradley-Terry models of preference can produce more reliable rankings. Notably, our method increases both the Spearman correlation and the Kendall correlation with Chatbot Arena (95.0% -> 96.4% and 82.1% -> 86.3% respectively). To address the computational cost of round-robin tournaments, we propose Swiss-Wise Iterative Matchmaking (Swim) tournaments, using a dynamic matching strategy to capture the benefits of round-robin tournaments while maintaining computational efficiency.

      While Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming numerous applications, their susceptibility to conversational breakdowns remains a critical challenge undermining user trust. This paper introduces a "Detect, Explain, Escalate" framework to manage dialogue breakdowns in LLM-powered agents, emphasizing low-carbon operation. Our approach integrates two key strategies: (1) We fine-tune a compact 8B-parameter model, augmented with teacher-generated reasoning traces, which serves as an efficient real-time breakdown 'detector' and 'explainer'. This model demonstrates robust classification and calibration on English and Japanese dialogues, and generalizes well to the BETOLD dataset, improving accuracy by 7% over its baseline. (2) We systematically evaluate frontier LLMs using advanced prompting (few-shot, chain-of-thought, analogical reasoning) for high-fidelity breakdown assessment. These are integrated into an 'escalation' architecture where our efficient detector defers to larger models only when necessary, substantially reducing operational costs and energy consumption. Our fine-tuned model and prompting strategies establish new state-of-the-art results on dialogue breakdown detection benchmarks, outperforming specialized classifiers and significantly narrowing the performance gap to larger proprietary models. The proposed monitor-escalate pipeline reduces inference costs by 54%, offering a scalable, efficient, and more interpretable solution for robust conversational AI in high-impact domains. Code and models will be publicly released.

      Long context large language models (LLMs) are deployed in many real-world applications such as RAG, agent, and broad LLM-integrated applications. Given an instruction and a long context (e.g., documents, PDF files, webpages), a long context LLM can generate an output grounded in the provided context, aiming to provide more accurate, up-to-date, and verifiable outputs while reducing hallucinations and unsupported claims. This raises a research question: how to pinpoint the texts (e.g., sentences, passages, or paragraphs) in the context that contribute most to or are responsible for the generated output by an LLM? This process, which we call context traceback, has various real-world applications, such as 1) debugging LLM-based systems, 2) conducting post-attack forensic analysis for attacks (e.g., prompt injection attack, knowledge corruption attacks) to an LLM, and 3) highlighting knowledge sources to enhance the trust of users towards outputs generated by LLMs. When applied to context traceback for long context LLMs, existing feature attribution methods such as Shapley have sub-optimal performance and/or incur a large computational cost. In this work, we develop TracLLM, the first generic context traceback framework tailored to long context LLMs. Our framework can improve the effectiveness and efficiency of existing feature attribution methods. To improve the efficiency, we develop an informed search based algorithm in TracLLM. We also develop contribution score ensemble/denoising techniques to improve the accuracy of TracLLM.

We propose R-Search, a novel reinforcement learning framework for Reasoning-Search integration, designed to enable LLMs to autonomously execute multi-step reasoning with deep search interaction, and learn optimal reasoning search interaction trajectories via multi-reward signals, improving response quality in complex logic- and knowledge-intensive tasks. R-Search guides the LLM to dynamically decide when to retrieve or reason, while globally integrating key evidence to enhance deep knowledge interaction between reasoning and search. During RL training, R-Search provides multi-stage, multi-type rewards to jointly optimize the reasoning-search trajectory. Experiments on seven datasets show that R-Search outperforms advanced RAG baselines by up to 32.2% (in-domain) and 25.1% (out-of-domain).

This paper presents a novel token-aware data imputation method that leverages the in-context learning capabilities of large language models.

We test this approach with two class-imbalanced binary classification datasets and evaluate the effectiveness of imputation using classification-based evaluation metrics. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the input prompt size while maintaining or improving imputation quality compared to our baseline prompt, especially for datasets that are of relatively smaller in size. The contributions of this presented work is two-fold -- 1) it sheds light on the importance of prompt design when leveraging LLMs for synthetic data generation and 2) it addresses a critical gap in LLM-based data imputation for class-imbalanced datasets with missing data by providing a practical solution within computational constraints. We hope that our work will foster further research and discussions about leveraging the incredible potential of LLMs and prompt engineering techniques for synthetic data generation.

Through a series of case studies, we assess whether LLMs can balance the interplay between dominant Great Traditions and localized Little Traditions. We explore various prompting strategies and further investigate whether using prompts in regional languages enhances the models cultural sensitivity and response quality. Our findings reveal that while LLMs demonstrate an ability to articulate cultural nuances, they often struggle to apply this understanding in practical, context-specific scenarios.

We also evaluate users' performance with and without Copilot across tasks. In objective tasks, participants reported a reduction of workload and an increase in enjoyment, which was paired with objective performance increases. Participants reported reduced workload and increased enjoyment with no change in performance in a creative poetry writing task. However, no benefits due to Copilot use were reported in a highly subjective self-reflection task. Although no physiological changes were recorded due to Copilot use, task-dependent differences in prefrontal cortex activation offer complementary insights into the cognitive processes associated with successful and unsuccessful human-AI collaboration. These findings suggest that AI assistants' effectiveness varies with task type-particularly showing decreased usefulness in tasks that engage episodic memory-and presents a brain-network based hypothesis of human-AI collaboration.

      The development of large language models (LLMs) depends on trustworthy evaluation. However, most current evaluations rely on public benchmarks, which are prone to data contamination issues that significantly compromise fairness. Previous researches have focused on constructing dynamic benchmarks to address contamination. However, continuously building new benchmarks is costly and cyclical. In this work, we aim to tackle contamination by analyzing the mechanisms of contaminated models themselves. Through our experiments, we discover that the overestimation of contaminated models is likely due to parameters acquiring shortcut solutions in training. We further propose a novel method for identifying shortcut neurons through comparative and causal analysis. Building on this, we introduce an evaluation method called shortcut neuron patching to suppress shortcut neurons. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach in mitigating contamination. Additionally, our evaluation results exhibit a strong linear correlation with MixEval, a recently released trustworthy benchmark, achieving a Spearman coefficient ($\rho$) exceeding 0.95. This high correlation indicates that our method closely reveals true capabilities of the models and is trustworthy.

      Recently, scaling test-time compute on Large Language Models (LLM) has garnered wide attention. However, there has been limited investigation of how various reasoning prompting strategies perform as scaling. In this paper, we focus on a standard and realistic scaling setting: majority voting. We systematically conduct experiments on 6 LLMs $\times$ 8 prompting strategies $\times$ 6 benchmarks. Experiment results consistently show that as the sampling time and computational overhead increase, complicated prompting strategies with superior initial performance gradually fall behind simple Chain-of-Thought. We analyze this phenomenon and provide theoretical proofs. Additionally, we propose a probabilistic method to efficiently predict scaling performance and identify the best prompting strategy under large sampling times, eliminating the need for resource-intensive inference processes in practical applications. Furthermore, we introduce two ways derived from our theoretical analysis to significantly improve the scaling performance. We hope that our research can promote to re-examine the role of complicated prompting, unleash the potential of simple prompting strategies, and provide new insights for enhancing test-time scaling performance.

      Agentic AI systems, built on large language models (LLMs) and deployed in multi-agent configurations, are redefining intelligent autonomy, collaboration and decision-making across enterprise and societal domains. This review presents a structured analysis of Trust, Risk, and Security Management (TRiSM) in the context of LLM-based agentic multi-agent systems (AMAS). We begin by examining the conceptual foundations of agentic AI, its architectural differences from traditional AI agents, and the emerging system designs that enable scalable, tool-using autonomy. The TRiSM in the agentic AI framework is then detailed through four pillars governance, explainability, ModelOps, and privacy/security each contextualized for agentic LLMs. We identify unique threat vectors and introduce a comprehensive risk taxonomy for the agentic AI applications, supported by case studies illustrating real-world vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the paper also surveys trust-building mechanisms, transparency and oversight techniques, and state-of-the-art explainability strategies in distributed LLM agent systems. Additionally, metrics for evaluating trust, interpretability, and human-centered performance are reviewed alongside open benchmarking challenges. Security and privacy are addressed through encryption, adversarial defense, and compliance with evolving AI regulations. The paper concludes with a roadmap for responsible agentic AI, proposing research directions to align emerging multi-agent systems with robust TRiSM principles for safe, accountable, and transparent deployment.

      LLM-as-a-Judge employs large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, to evaluate the quality of LLM-generated responses, gaining popularity for its cost-effectiveness and strong alignment with human evaluations. However, training proxy judge models using evaluation data generated by powerful teacher models introduces a critical yet previously overlooked issue: teacher preference bias, where the proxy judge model learns a biased preference for responses from the teacher model. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel setting that incorporates an additional assistant model, which is not biased toward the teacher model's responses, to complement the training data. Building on this setup, we introduce AGDe-Judge, a three-stage framework designed to debias from both the labels and feedbacks in the training data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AGDe-Judge effectively reduces teacher preference bias while maintaining strong performance across six evaluation benchmarks.

      Inference for Large Language Models (LLMs) is computationally demanding. To reduce the cost of auto-regressive decoding, Key-Value (KV) cache is used to store intermediate activations, which significantly lowers the computational overhead for token generation. However, the memory required for the KV cache grows rapidly, often exceeding the capacity of GPU memory. A cost-effective alternative is to offload KV cache to CPU memory, which alleviates GPU memory pressure, but shifts the bottleneck to the limited bandwidth of the PCIe connection between the CPU and GPU. Existing methods attempt to address these issues by overlapping GPU computation with I/O or employing CPU-GPU heterogeneous execution, but they are hindered by excessive data movement and dependence on CPU capabilities. Fully overlapping PCIe communication latency gets challenging as the size of the KV cache grows and/or the GPU compute capabilities increase. In this paper, we introduce KVPR, an efficient I/O-aware LLM inference method where the CPU first transfers a partial set of activations, from which the GPU can start recomputing the KV cache values. While the GPU recomputes the partial KV cache, the remaining portion of the KV cache is transferred concurrently from the CPU. This approach overlaps GPU recomputation with KV cache transfer to minimize idle GPU time and maximize inference performance. KVPR is fully automated by integrating a profiler module that utilizes input characteristics and system hardware information, a scheduler module to optimize the distribution of computation and communication workloads, and a runtime module to efficiently execute the derived execution plan. Experimental results show that KVPR achieves up to 35.8% lower latency and 46.2% higher throughput during decoding compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

      Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in medicine is crucial because medical applications require high accuracy with little room for error. Current medical benchmarks have three main types: medical exam-based, comprehensive medical, and specialized assessments. However, these benchmarks have limitations in question design (mostly multiple-choice), data sources (often not derived from real clinical scenarios), and evaluation methods (poor assessment of complex reasoning). To address these issues, we present LLMEval-Med, a new benchmark covering five core medical areas, including 2,996 questions created from real-world electronic health records and expert-designed clinical scenarios. We also design an automated evaluation pipeline, incorporating expert-developed checklists into our LLM-as-Judge framework. Furthermore, our methodology validates machine scoring through human-machine agreement analysis, dynamically refining checklists and prompts based on expert feedback to ensure reliability. We evaluate 13 LLMs across three categories (specialized medical models, open-source models, and closed-source models) on LLMEval-Med, providing valuable insights for the safe and effective deployment of LLMs in medical domains. The dataset is released in https://github.com/llmeval/LLMEval-Med.

      Navigation instruction generation for visually impaired (VI) individuals (NIG-VI) is critical yet relatively underexplored. This study, hence, focuses on producing precise, in-situ, step-by-step navigation instructions that are practically usable by VI users. Concretely, we propose LaF-GRPO (LLM-as-Follower GRPO), where an LLM simulates VI user responses to generate rewards guiding the Vision-Language Model (VLM) post-training. This enhances instruction usability while reducing costly real-world data needs. To facilitate training and testing, we introduce NIG4VI, a 27k-sample open-sourced benchmark. It provides diverse navigation scenarios with accurate spatial coordinates, supporting detailed, open-ended in-situ instruction generation. Experiments on NIG4VI show the effectiveness of LaF-GRPO by quantitative metrics (e.g., Zero-(LaF-GRPO) boosts BLEU +14\%; SFT+(LaF-GRPO) METEOR 0.542 vs. GPT-4o's 0.323) and yields more intuitive, safer instructions.

      Aligning large language models (LLMs) to human preferences is a crucial step in building helpful and safe AI tools, which usually involve training on supervised datasets. Popular algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) rely on pairs of AI-generated responses ranked according to human annotation. The response pair annotation process might bring human bias. Building a correct preference dataset is the costly part of the alignment pipeline. To improve annotation efficiency and quality in the LLMs alignment, we propose REAL: Response Embedding-based Alignment for LLMs, a strategy for constructing a high-quality training dataset that focuses on acquiring the less ambiguous preference pairs for labeling out of a set of response candidates. Our selection process is based on the similarity of embedding responses independently of prompts, which guarantees the selection process in an off-policy setting, avoiding adaptively measuring the similarity during the training. Experimental results on real-world dataset SHP2 and synthetic HH-RLHF benchmarks indicate that choosing dissimilar response pairs enhances the direct alignment of LLMs while reducing inherited labeling errors. The model aligned with dissimilar response pairs obtained a better margin and win rate on the dialogue task. Our findings suggest that focusing on distinct pairs can reduce the label error and improve LLM alignment efficiency, saving up to $65\%$ of annotators' work.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to align model responses with human preferences. While RLHF employs a reinforcement learning approach with a separate reward model, SFT uses human-curated datasets for supervised learning. Both approaches traditionally depend on small, vetted groups of annotators, making them costly, prone to bias, and limited in scalability. We propose an open, crowd-sourced fine-tuning framework that addresses these limitations by enabling broader feedback collection for SFT without extensive annotator training. Our framework promotes incentive fairness via a point-based reward system correlated with Shapley values and guides model convergence through iterative model updates. Our multi-model selection framework demonstrates up to a 55% reduction in target distance over single-model selection, enabling subsequent experiments that validate our point-based reward mechanism's close alignment with Shapley values (a well-established method for attributing individual contributions) thereby supporting fair and scalable participation.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Large Language Models (LLMs) currently respond to every prompt. However, they can produce incorrect answers when they lack knowledge or capability -- a problem known as hallucination. We instead propose post-training an LLM to generate content only when confident in its correctness and to otherwise (partially) abstain. Specifically, our method, HALT, produces capability-aligned post-training data that encodes what the model can and cannot reliably generate. We generate this data by splitting responses of the pretrained LLM into factual fragments (atomic statements or reasoning steps), and use ground truth information to identify incorrect fragments. We achieve capability-aligned finetuning responses by either removing incorrect fragments or replacing them with "Unsure from Here" -- according to a tunable threshold that allows practitioners to trade off response completeness and mean correctness of the response's fragments. We finetune four open-source models for biography writing, mathematics, coding, and medicine with HALT for three different trade-off thresholds. HALT effectively trades off response completeness for correctness, increasing the mean correctness of response fragments by 15% on average, while resulting in a 4% improvement in the F1 score (mean of completeness and correctness of the response) compared to the relevant baselines. By tuning HALT for highest correctness, we train a single reliable Llama3-70B model with correctness increased from 51% to 87% across all four domains while maintaining 53% of the response completeness achieved with standard finetuning.

      Generative models, especially large language models (LLMs), have shown remarkable progress in producing text that appears human-like. However, they often exhibit patterns that make their output easier to detect than text written by humans. In this paper, we investigate how explainable AI (XAI) methods can be used to reduce the detectability of AI-generated text (AIGT) while also introducing a robust ensemble-based detection approach. We begin by training an ensemble classifier to distinguish AIGT from human-written text, then apply SHAP and LIME to identify tokens that most strongly influence its predictions. We propose four explainability-based token replacement strategies to modify these influential tokens. Our findings show that these token replacement approaches can significantly diminish a single classifier's ability to detect AIGT. However, our ensemble classifier maintains strong performance across multiple languages and domains, showing that a multi-model approach can mitigate the impact of token-level manipulations. These results show that XAI methods can make AIGT harder to detect by focusing on the most influential tokens. At the same time, they highlight the need for robust, ensemble-based detection strategies that can adapt to evolving approaches for hiding AIGT.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming a wide range of domains, yet verifying their outputs remains a significant challenge, especially for complex open-ended tasks such as consolidation, summarization, and knowledge extraction. To address this, we introduce CheckEmbed (CE): a simple, scalable, and accurate verification method. CE reduces each LLM answer to a single embedding vector using powerful modern embedding LLM models like SFR-Embedding-Mistral. Prior methods such as BERTScore and SelfCheckGPT relied on weaker encoders like BERT, forcing them to operate at token or sentence granularity. In contrast, CE performs fast, semantically rich comparisons directly at the whole-answer level, overcoming key limitations in both accuracy and scalability. We conduct a comprehensive design and time complexity analysis across 13 verification baselines, including classical text scorers (e.g., BLEU), stability-based methods (e.g., SelfCheckGPT), and generative evaluators (e.g., LLM-as-a-Judge), which highlights the effectiveness, efficiency, versatility, and simplicity of CE. Empirical results show that CE reliably detects hallucinations in both closed and open-ended tasks. We further present evidence that CE generalizes beyond text to other modalities such as vision, establishing it as a practical and versatile verification framework.

      LLMs have been extensively used for the task of automated code generation. In this work, we examine the applicability of LLMs for the related but relatively unexplored task of code-equivalence checking, i.e., given two programs, whether they are functionally equivalent or not. This is an important problem since benchmarking code equivalence can play a critical role in evaluating LLM capabilities for tasks such as code re-writing and code translation. Towards this end, we present CETBench - Code Equivalence with Transformations Benchmark, constructed via a repository of programs, where two programs in the repository may be solving the same or different tasks. Each instance in our dataset is obtained by taking a pair of programs in the repository and applying a random series of pre-defined code transformations, resulting in (non-)equivalent pairs. Our analysis on this dataset reveals a surprising finding that very simple code transformations in the underlying pair of programs can result in a significant drop in performance of SOTA LLMs for the task of code-equivalence checking. To remedy this, we present a simple fine-tuning-based approach to boost LLM performance on the transformed pairs of programs. Our approach for dataset generation is generic, and can be used with repositories with varying program difficulty levels and allows for applying varying numbers as well as kinds of transformations. In our experiments, we perform ablations over the difficulty level of original programs, as well as the kind of transformations used in generating pairs for equivalence checking. Our analysis presents deep insights into the working of LLMs for the task of code-equivalence, and points to the fact that they may still be far from what could be termed as a semantic understanding of the underlying code.

      As Large Language Model (LLM) agents become more widespread, associated misalignment risks increase. Prior work has examined agents' ability to enact misaligned behaviour (misalignment capability) and their compliance with harmful instructions (misuse propensity). However, the likelihood of agents attempting misaligned behaviours in real-world settings (misalignment propensity) remains poorly understood. We introduce a misalignment propensity benchmark, AgentMisalignment, consisting of a suite of realistic scenarios in which LLM agents have the opportunity to display misaligned behaviour. We organise our evaluations into subcategories of misaligned behaviours, including goal-guarding, resisting shutdown, sandbagging, and power-seeking. We report the performance of frontier models on our benchmark, observing higher misalignment on average when evaluating more capable models. Finally, we systematically vary agent personalities through different system prompts. We find that persona characteristics can dramatically and unpredictably influence misalignment tendencies -- occasionally far more than the choice of model itself -- highlighting the importance of careful system prompt engineering for deployed AI agents. Our work highlights the failure of current alignment methods to generalise to LLM agents, and underscores the need for further propensity evaluations as autonomous systems become more prevalent.

      Although large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in recommender systems, the prohibitive computational costs for fine-tuning LLMs on entire datasets hinder their successful deployment in real-world scenarios. To develop affordable and effective LLM-based recommender systems, we focus on the task of coreset selection which identifies a small subset of fine-tuning data to optimize the test loss, thereby facilitating efficient LLMs' fine-tuning. Although there exist some intuitive solutions of subset selection, including distribution-based and importance-based approaches, they often lead to suboptimal performance due to the misalignment with downstream fine-tuning objectives or weak generalization ability caused by individual-level sample selection. To overcome these challenges, we propose GORACS, which is a novel Group-level Optimal tRAnsport-guided Coreset Selection framework for LLM-based recommender systems. GORACS is designed based on two key principles for coreset selection: 1) selecting the subsets that minimize the test loss to align with fine-tuning objectives, and 2) enhancing model generalization through group-level data selection. Corresponding to these two principles, GORACS has two key components: 1) a Proxy Optimization Objective (POO) leveraging optimal transport and gradient information to bound the intractable test loss, thus reducing computational costs by avoiding repeated LLM retraining, and 2) a two-stage Initialization-Then-Refinement Algorithm (ITRA) for efficient group-level selection. Our extensive experiments across diverse recommendation datasets and tasks validate that GORACS significantly reduces fine-tuning costs of LLMs while achieving superior performance over the state-of-the-art baselines and full data training.

      Unit testing plays a critical role in ensuring software correctness. However, writing unit tests manually is laborious, especially for strong typed languages like Java, motivating the need for automated approaches. Traditional methods primarily rely on search-based or randomized algorithms to generate tests that achieve high code coverage and produce regression oracles, which are derived from the program's current behavior rather than its intended functionality. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled oracle generation from natural language descriptions. However, existing LLM-based methods often require LLM fine-tuning or rely on external tools such as EvoSuite for test prefix generation. In this work, we propose CANDOR, a novel end-to-end, prompt-based LLM framework for automated JUnit test generation. CANDOR orchestrates multiple specialized LLM agents to generate JUnit tests, including both high-quality test prefixes and accurate oracles. To mitigate the notorious hallucinations in LLMs, we introduce a novel strategy that engages multiple reasoning LLMs in a panel discussion and generate accurate oracles based on consensus. Additionally, to reduce the verbosity of reasoning LLMs' outputs, we propose a novel dual-LLM pipeline to produce concise and structured oracle evaluations. Our experiments on the HumanEvalJava and LeetCodeJava datasets show that CANDOR can generate accurate oracles and is slightly better than EvoSuite in generating tests with high line coverage and clearly superior in terms of mutation score. Moreover, CANDOR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art, prompt-based test generator LLM-Empirical, achieving improvements of 15.8 to 25.1 percentage points in oracle correctness on both correct and faulty source code. Ablation studies confirm the critical contributions of key agents in improving test prefix quality and oracle accuracy.

      Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) with numerical feedback, such as scalar rewards, have significantly enhanced the complex reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite this success, we identify three key challenges encountered by RL with solely numerical feedback: performance plateaus, limited effectiveness of self-reflection, and persistent failures. We then demonstrate that RL-finetuned models, even after exhibiting performance plateaus, can generate correct refinements on persistently failed problems by leveraging natural language feedback in the form of critiques. Building on this insight, we propose Critique-GRPO, an online RL framework that integrates both natural language and numerical feedback for effective policy optimization. Critique-GRPO enables LLMs to learn from initial responses and critique-guided refinements simultaneously while maintaining exploration. Extensive experiments using Qwen2.5-7B-Base and Qwen3-8B-Base show that Critique-GRPO consistently outperforms supervised learning-based and RL-based fine-tuning approaches across eight challenging mathematical, STEM, and general reasoning tasks, improving average pass@1 scores by approximately 4.5% and 5%, respectively. Notably, Critique-GRPO surpasses a strong baseline that incorporates expert demonstrations within online RL. Further analysis reveals two critical insights about policy exploration: (1) higher entropy does not always guarantee efficient learning from exploration, and (2) longer responses do not necessarily lead to more effective exploration.

      Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) effectively enhances external knowledge integration capabilities by explicitly modeling knowledge relationships, thereby improving the factual accuracy and generation quality of Large Language Models (LLMs) in specialized domains. However, existing methods suffer from two inherent limitations: 1) Inefficient Information Aggregation: They rely on a single agent and fixed iterative patterns, making it difficult to adaptively capture multi-level textual, structural, and degree information within graph data. 2) Rigid Reasoning Mechanism: They employ preset reasoning schemes, which cannot dynamically adjust reasoning depth nor achieve precise semantic correction. To overcome these limitations, we propose Graph Counselor, an GraphRAG method based on multi-agent collaboration. This method uses the Adaptive Graph Information Extraction Module (AGIEM), where Planning, Thought, and Execution Agents work together to precisely model complex graph structures and dynamically adjust information extraction strategies, addressing the challenges of multi-level dependency modeling and adaptive reasoning depth.

      Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with visualization tasks like plotting diagrams, charts, where success depends on both code correctness and visual semantics. Existing instruction-tuning datasets lack execution-grounded supervision and offer limited support for iterative code correction, resulting in fragile and unreliable plot generation. We present VisCode-200K, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset for Python-based visualization and self-correction. It contains over 200K examples from two sources: (1) validated plotting code from open-source repositories, paired with natural language instructions and rendered plots; and (2) 45K multi-turn correction dialogues from Code-Feedback, enabling models to revise faulty code using runtime feedback. We fine-tune Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct on VisCode-200K to create VisCoder, and evaluate it on PandasPlotBench. VisCoder significantly outperforms strong open-source baselines and approaches the performance of proprietary models like GPT-4o-mini. We further adopt a self-debug evaluation protocol to assess iterative repair, demonstrating the benefits of feedback-driven learning for executable, visually accurate code generation.

      Enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs has garnered significant attention in both the mathematical and computer science communities. Recent works have made substantial progress in both Natural Language (NL) reasoning and Formal Language (FL) reasoning by leveraging the potential of pure Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods on base models. However, RL approaches struggle to impart new capabilities not presented in the base model, highlighting the need to integrate more knowledge like FL into NL math reasoning effectively. Yet, this integration is challenging due to inherent disparities in problem structure and reasoning format between NL and FL. To address these challenges, we introduce **NL-FL HybridReasoning**, an end-to-end framework designed to incorporate the FL expert into NL math problem-solving. To bridge the NL and FL input format gap, we propose the *NL-FL Problem Alignment* method, which reformulates the Question-Answering (QA) problems in NL as existence theorems in FL. Subsequently, the *Mixed Problem Input* technique we provide enables the FL reasoner to handle both QA and existence problems concurrently. Lastly, we mitigate the NL and FL output format gap in reasoning through an LLM-based *Answer Extraction* mechanism. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the **HybridReasoning** framework achieves **89.80%** and **84.34%** accuracy rates on the MATH-500 and the AMC benchmarks, surpassing the NL baseline by 4.60% and 4.82%, respectively. Notably, some problems resolved by our framework remain unsolved by the NL baseline model even under a larger number of trials.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Large language models (LLMs) are known to be sensitive to input phrasing, but the mechanisms by which semantic cues shape reasoning remain poorly understood. We investigate this phenomenon in the context of comparative math problems with objective ground truth, revealing a consistent and directional framing bias: logically equivalent questions containing the words ``more'', ``less'', or ``equal'' systematically steer predictions in the direction of the framing term. To study this effect, we introduce MathComp, a controlled benchmark of 300 comparison scenarios, each evaluated under 14 prompt variants across three LLM families. We find that model errors frequently reflect linguistic steering, systematic shifts toward the comparative term present in the prompt. Chain-of-thought prompting reduces these biases, but its effectiveness varies: free-form reasoning is more robust, while structured formats may preserve or reintroduce directional drift. Finally, we show that including demographic identity terms (e.g., ``a woman'', ``a Black person'') in input scenarios amplifies directional drift, despite identical underlying quantities, highlighting the interplay between semantic framing and social referents. These findings expose critical blind spots in standard evaluation and motivate framing-aware benchmarks for diagnosing reasoning robustness and fairness in LLMs.

      Several closed-source LLMs have consistently outperformed open-source alternatives in program repair tasks, primarily due to their superior reasoning capabilities and extensive pre-training. This paper introduces Repairity, a novel three-stage methodology that significantly narrows this performance gap through reasoning extraction and reinforcement learning. Our approach: (1) systematically filters high-quality reasoning traces from closed-source models using correctness verification, (2) transfers this reasoning knowledge to open-source models via supervised fine-tuning, and (3) develops reinforcement learning with LLM-based feedback to further optimize performance. Empirical evaluation across multiple program repair benchmarks demonstrates that Repairity improves the performance of Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct, a base open source LLM, by 8.68\% on average, reducing the capability gap with Claude-Sonnet3.7, a state-of-the-art closed-source model, from 10.05% to 1.35%. Ablation studies confirm that both reasoning extraction and LLM-guided reinforcement learning contribute significantly to these improvements. Our methodology generalizes effectively to additional code-related tasks, enabling organizations to leverage high-quality program repair capabilities while maintaining the customizability, transparency, and deployment flexibility inherent to open-source models.

      With the rise of AI-based code generation, customizing existing code out of natural language instructions to modify visual results -such as figures or images -has become possible, promising to reduce the need for deep programming expertise. However, even experienced developers can struggle with this task, as it requires identifying relevant code regions (feature location), generating valid code variants, and ensuring the modifications reliably align with user intent. In this paper, we introduce vTikZ, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to customize code while preserving coherent visual outcomes. Our benchmark consists of carefully curated vTikZ editing scenarios, parameterized ground truths, and a reviewing tool that leverages visual feedback to assess correctness. Empirical evaluation with stateof-the-art LLMs shows that existing solutions struggle to reliably modify code in alignment with visual intent, highlighting a gap in current AI-assisted code editing approaches. We argue that vTikZ opens new research directions for integrating LLMs with visual feedback mechanisms to improve code customization tasks in various domains beyond TikZ, including image processing, art creation, Web design, and 3D modeling.

      Extensive LLM applications demand efficient structured generations, particularly for LR(1) grammars, to produce outputs in specified formats (e.g., JSON). Existing methods primarily parse LR(1) grammars into a pushdown automaton (PDA), leading to runtime execution overhead for context-dependent token processing, especially inefficient under large inference batches. To address these issues, we propose Pre$^3$ that exploits deterministic pushdown automata (DPDA) to optimize the constrained LLM decoding efficiency. First, by precomputing prefix-conditioned edges during the preprocessing, Pre$^3$ enables ahead-of-time edge analysis and thus makes parallel transition processing possible. Second, by leveraging the prefix-conditioned edges, Pre$^3$ introduces a novel approach that transforms LR(1) transition graphs into DPDA, eliminating the need for runtime path exploration and achieving edge transitions with minimal overhead. Pre$^3$ can be seamlessly integrated into standard LLM inference frameworks, reducing time per output token (TPOT) by up to 40% and increasing throughput by up to 36% in our experiments.

      Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential for data annotation, markedly reducing the labor costs associated with downstream applications. However, existing methods mostly adopt an aggressive strategy by prompting LLM to determine a single gold label for each unlabeled sample. Due to the inherent uncertainty within LLMs, they often produce incorrect labels for difficult samples, severely compromising the data quality for downstream applications. Motivated by ambiguity aversion in human behaviors, we propose a novel candidate annotation paradigm wherein large language models are encouraged to output all possible labels when incurring uncertainty. To ensure unique labels are provided for downstream tasks, we develop a teacher-student framework CanDist that distills candidate annotations with a Small Language Model (SLM). We further provide a rigorous justification demonstrating that distilling candidate annotations from the teacher LLM offers superior theoretical guarantees compared to directly using single annotations. Extensive experiments across six text classification tasks validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The source code is available at https://github.com/MingxuanXia/CanDist.

      Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved impressive performance across a wide range of natural language tasks and are now widely used in real-world applications. Among them, black-box LLMs--served via APIs without access to model internals--are especially dominant due to their scalability and ease of deployment. Despite their strong capabilities, these models typically produce generalized responses that overlook personal preferences and reasoning styles. This has led to growing interest in black-box LLM personalization, which aims to tailor model outputs to user-specific context without modifying model parameters. However, existing approaches primarily focus on response-level personalization, attempting to match final outputs without modeling personal thought process. To address this limitation, we propose RPM, a framework for reasoning-level personalization that aligns the model's reasoning process with a user's personalized logic. RPM first constructs statistical user-specific factors by extracting and grouping response-influential features from user history. It then builds personalized reasoning paths that reflect how these factors are used in context. In the inference stage, RPM retrieves reasoning-aligned examples for new queries via feature-level similarity and performs inference conditioned on the structured factors and retrieved reasoning paths, enabling the model to follow user-specific reasoning trajectories. This reasoning-level personalization enhances both predictive accuracy and interpretability by grounding model outputs in user-specific logic through structured information. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks show that RPM consistently outperforms response-level personalization methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of reasoning-level personalization in black-box LLMs.

      Large language models (LLMs) have majorly advanced NLP and AI, and next to their ability to perform a wide range of procedural tasks, a major success factor is their internalized factual knowledge. Since Petroni et al. (2019), analyzing this knowledge has gained attention. However, most approaches investigate one question at a time via modest-sized pre-defined samples, introducing an ``availability bias'' (Tversky&Kahnemann, 1973) that prevents the analysis of knowledge (or beliefs) of LLMs beyond the experimenter's predisposition. To address this challenge, we propose a novel methodology to comprehensively materialize an LLM's factual knowledge through recursive querying and result consolidation. Our approach is a milestone for LLM research, for the first time providing constructive insights into the scope and structure of LLM knowledge (or beliefs). As a prototype, we build GPTKB, a knowledge base (KB) comprising 101 million relational triples for over 2.9 million entities from GPT-4o-mini. We use GPTKB to exemplarily analyze GPT-4o-mini's factual knowledge in terms of scale, accuracy, bias, cutoff and consistency, at the same time. GPTKB is accessible at https://gptkb.org

Grounded in early-stage research projects with industrial partners, the work spans manufacturing, modeling, life-science, and design processes, addressing domain-specific challenges through human-AI collaboration. In manufacturing, an LLM-driven framework integrates uncertainty-aware explainable Machine Learning (ML) with interactive dialogues, transforming opaque predictions into auditable workflows. For process modeling, conversational interfaces democratize BPMN design. Pharmacovigilance agents automate drug safety monitoring via knowledge-graph-augmented LLMs. Finally, sustainable textile design employs multi-agent systems to navigate regulatory and environmental trade-offs. We intend to examine tensions between transparency and efficiency, generalization and specialization, and human agency versus automation. By mapping these trade-offs, we advocate for context-sensitive integration prioritizing domain needs, stakeholder values, and iterative human-in-the-loop workflows over universal solutions.

      Query expansion methods powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness in zero-shot retrieval tasks. These methods assume that LLMs can generate hypothetical documents that, when incorporated into a query vector, enhance the retrieval of real evidence. However, we challenge this assumption by investigating whether knowledge leakage in benchmarks contributes to the observed performance gains. Using fact verification as a testbed, we analyze whether the generated documents contain information entailed by ground-truth evidence and assess their impact on performance. Our findings indicate that, on average, performance improvements consistently occurred for claims whose generated documents included sentences entailed by gold evidence. This suggests that knowledge leakage may be present in fact-verification benchmarks, potentially inflating the perceived performance of LLM-based query expansion methods.

      Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for long-content generation (e.g., long Chain-of-Thought reasoning) where decoding efficiency becomes a critical bottleneck: Autoregressive decoding is inherently limited by its sequential token generation process, where each token must be generated before the next can be processed. This sequential dependency restricts the ability to fully leverage modern hardware's parallel processing capabilities. Existing methods like speculative decoding and layer skipping offer potential speedups but have notable drawbacks: speculative decoding relies on an auxiliary "drafter" model, which can be challenging to acquire and increases memory overhead, while layer skipping may introduce discrepancies in the outputs due to the missing key-value cache at skipped layers. In this work, we propose AdaDecode, which accelerates LLM decoding without requiring auxiliary models or changes to the original model parameters, while ensuring output consistency. AdaDecode leverages the insight that many tokens can accurately be generated at intermediate layers, as further layers often do not significantly alter predictions once the model reaches a certain confidence. By adaptively generating tokens at intermediate layers when confidence is high, AdaDecode enables the next token's computation to begin immediately. The remaining layer computations for early-predicted tokens are deferred and executed in parallel with subsequent tokens when needed, maximizing hardware utilization and reducing decoding latency. A final verification step ensures that early predictions match the results of standard autoregressive decoding, preserving output parity. Experiments across diverse generation tasks shows that AdaDecode consistently achieves superior decoding throughput with up to 1.73x speedup, while guaranteeing output parity with standard autoregressive decoding.

We address this question along two dimensions: (1) developing a unified discourse relation label set to facilitate cross-lingual and cross-framework discourse analysis, and (2) probing LLMs to assess whether they encode generalizable discourse abstractions. Using multilingual discourse relation classification as a testbed, we examine a comprehensive set of 23 LLMs of varying sizes and multilingual capabilities. Our results show that LLMs, especially those with multilingual training corpora, can generalize discourse information across languages and frameworks.

      Despite rapid advancements in the research and deployment of large language models (LLMs), the statistical distribution of model parameters, as well as their influence on initialization, training dynamics, and downstream efficiency, has received surprisingly little attention. A recent work introduced BackSlash, a training-time compression algorithm. It first demonstrated that pre-trained LLM parameters follow generalized Gaussian distributions (GGDs) better. By optimizing GG priors during training, BackSlash can reduce parameters by up to 90\% with minimal performance loss. Building on this foundational insight, we propose a unified, end-to-end framework for LLM optimization based on the GG model. Our contributions are threefold: (1) GG-based initialization scheme that aligns with the statistical structure of trained models, resulting in faster convergence and improved accuracy; (2) DeepShape, a post-training regularization method that reshapes weight distributions to match a GG profile, improving compressibility with minimized degradation in performance; and (3) RF8, a compact and hardware-efficient 8-bit floating-point format designed for GG-distributed-initialized BackSlash training, enabling low-cost inference without compromising accuracy. Experiments across diverse model architectures show that our framework consistently yields smaller and faster models that match or outperform standard training baselines.

      Formal logic enables computers to reason in natural language by representing sentences in symbolic forms and applying rules to derive conclusions. However, in what our study characterizes as "rulebreaker" scenarios, this method can lead to conclusions that are typically not inferred or accepted by humans given their common sense and factual knowledge. Inspired by works in cognitive science, we create RULEBREAKERS, the first dataset for rigorously evaluating the ability of large language models (LLMs) to recognize and respond to rulebreakers (versus non-rulebreakers) in a human-like manner. Evaluating seven LLMs, we find that most models, including GPT-4o, achieve mediocre accuracy on RULEBREAKERS and exhibit some tendency to over-rigidly apply logical rules unlike what is expected from typical human reasoners. Further analysis suggests that this apparent failure is potentially associated with the models' poor utilization of their world knowledge and their attention distribution patterns. Whilst revealing a limitation of current LLMs, our study also provides a timely counterbalance to a growing body of recent works that propose methods relying on formal logic to improve LLMs' general reasoning capabilities, highlighting their risk of further increasing divergence between LLMs and human-like reasoning.

      Auto-vectorization is a fundamental optimization for modern compilers to exploit SIMD parallelism. However, state-of-the-art approaches still struggle to handle intricate code patterns, often requiring manual hints or domain-specific expertise. Large language models (LLMs), with their ability to capture intricate patterns, provide a promising solution, yet their effective application in compiler optimizations remains an open challenge due to issues such as hallucinations and a lack of domain-specific reasoning. In this paper, we present VecTrans, a novel framework that leverages LLMs to enhance compiler-based code vectorization. VecTrans first employs compiler analysis to identify potentially vectorizable code regions. It then utilizes an LLM to refactor these regions into patterns that are more amenable to the compilers auto-vectorization. To ensure semantic correctness, VecTrans further integrates a hybrid validation mechanism at the intermediate representation (IR) level. With the above efforts, VecTrans combines the adaptability of LLMs with the precision of compiler vectorization, thereby effectively opening up the vectorization opportunities. experimental results show that among all TSVC functions unvectorizable by GCC, ICC, Clang, and BiSheng Compiler, VecTrans achieves an geomean speedup of 1.77x and successfully vectorizes 24 of 51 test cases. This marks a significant advancement over state-of-the-art approaches while maintaining a cost efficiency of $0.012 per function optimization for LLM API usage.

      Malicious websites and phishing URLs pose an ever-increasing cybersecurity risk, with phishing attacks growing by 40% in a single year. Traditional detection approaches rely on machine learning classifiers or rule-based scanners operating in the cloud, but these face significant challenges in generalization, privacy, and evasion by sophisticated threats. In this paper, we propose a novel client-side framework for comprehensive URL analysis that leverages zero-shot inference by a local large language model (LLM) running entirely in-browser. Our system uses a compact LLM (e.g., 3B/8B parameters) via WebLLM to perform reasoning over rich context collected from the target webpage, including static code analysis (JavaScript abstract syntax trees, structure, and code patterns), dynamic sandbox execution results (DOM changes, API calls, and network requests),and visible content. We detail the architecture and methodology of the system, which combines a real browser sandbox (using iframes) resistant to common anti-analysis techniques, with an LLM-based analyzer that assesses potential vulnerabilities and malicious behaviors without any task-specific training (zero-shot). The LLM aggregates evidence from multiple sources (code, execution trace, page content) to classify the URL as benign or malicious and to provide an explanation of the threats or security issues identified. We evaluate our approach on a diverse set of benign and malicious URLs, demonstrating that even a compact client-side model can achieve high detection accuracy and insightful explanations comparable to cloud-based solutions, while operating privately on end-user devices. The results show that client-side LLM inference is a feasible and effective solution to web threat analysis, eliminating the need to send potentially sensitive data to cloud services.

      The proliferation of misinformation necessitates scalable, automated fact-checking solutions. Yet, current benchmarks often overlook multilingual and topical diversity. This paper introduces a novel, dynamically extensible data set that includes 61,514 claims in multiple languages and topics, extending existing datasets up to 2024. Through a comprehensive evaluation of five prominent Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4o, GPT-3.5 Turbo, LLaMA 3.1, and Mixtral 8x7B, we identify significant performance gaps between different languages and topics. While overall GPT-4o achieves the highest accuracy, it declines to classify 43% of claims. Across all models, factual-sounding claims are misclassified more often than opinions, revealing a key vulnerability. These findings underscore the need for caution and highlight challenges in deploying LLM-based fact-checking systems at scale.

      Fine-tuning LLMs on tabular classification tasks can lead to the phenomenon of fine-tuning multiplicity where equally well-performing models make conflicting predictions on the same input. Fine-tuning multiplicity can arise due to variations in the training process, e.g., seed, weight initialization, minor changes to training data, etc., raising concerns about the reliability of Tabular LLMs in high-stakes applications such as finance, hiring, education, healthcare. Our work formalizes this unique challenge of fine-tuning multiplicity in Tabular LLMs and proposes a novel measure to quantify the consistency of individual predictions without expensive model retraining. Our measure quantifies a prediction's consistency by analyzing (sampling) the model's local behavior around that input in the embedding space. Interestingly, we show that sampling in the local neighborhood can be leveraged to provide probabilistic guarantees on prediction consistency under a broad class of fine-tuned models, i.e., inputs with sufficiently high local stability (as defined by our measure) also remain consistent across several fine-tuned models with high probability. We perform experiments on multiple real-world datasets to show that our local stability measure preemptively captures consistency under actual multiplicity across several fine-tuned models, outperforming competing measures.

      Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited their problem-solving abilities in mathematical reasoning. Solving realistic optimization (OPT) problems in application scenarios requires advanced and applied mathematics ability. However, current OPT benchmarks that merely solve linear programming are far from complex realistic situations. In this work, we propose OptiBench, a benchmark for End-to-end optimization problem-solving with human-readable inputs and outputs. OptiBench contains rich optimization problems, including linear and nonlinear programming with or without tabular data, which can comprehensively evaluate LLMs' solving ability. In our benchmark, LLMs are required to call a code solver to provide precise numerical answers. Furthermore, to alleviate the data scarcity for optimization problems, and to bridge the gap between open-source LLMs on a small scale (e.g., Llama-3-8b) and closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4), we further propose a data synthesis method namely ReSocratic. Unlike general data synthesis methods that proceed from questions to answers, \ReSocratic first incrementally synthesizes formatted optimization demonstration with mathematical formulations step by step and then back-translates the generated demonstrations into questions. Based on this, we synthesize the ReSocratic-29k dataset. We further conduct supervised fine-tuning with ReSocratic-29k on multiple open-source models. Experimental results show that ReSocratic-29k significantly improves the performance of open-source models.

      Conventional biomedical research is increasingly labor-intensive due to the exponential growth of scientific literature and datasets. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has the potential to revolutionize this process by automating various steps. Still, significant challenges remain, including the need for multidisciplinary expertise, logicality of experimental design, and performance measurements. This paper introduces BioResearcher, the first end-to-end automated system designed to streamline the entire biomedical research process involving dry lab experiments. BioResearcher employs a modular multi-agent architecture, integrating specialized agents for search, literature processing, experimental design, and programming. By decomposing complex tasks into logically related sub-tasks and utilizing a hierarchical learning approach, BioResearcher effectively addresses the challenges of multidisciplinary requirements and logical complexity. Furthermore, BioResearcher incorporates an LLM-based reviewer for in-process quality control and introduces novel evaluation metrics to assess the quality and automation of experimental protocols. BioResearcher successfully achieves an average execution success rate of 63.07% across eight previously unmet research objectives. The generated protocols averagely outperform typical agent systems by 22.0% on five quality metrics. The system demonstrates significant potential to reduce researchers' workloads and accelerate biomedical discoveries, paving the way for future innovations in automated research systems.

      Large Language Model (LLM) agents are reshaping the game industry, particularly with more intelligent and human-preferable game characters. However, existing game benchmarks fall short of practical needs: they lack evaluations of diverse LLM capabilities across various game genres, studies of agentic modules crucial for complex gameplay, and fine-tuning datasets for aligning pre-trained LLMs into gaming agents. To fill these gaps, we present \textbf{\benchname{}}, a foundational benchmark designed to train and evaluate LLM agents across diverse real-world video games. Unlike existing benchmarks, Orak includes 12 popular video games spanning all major genres, enabling comprehensive studies of LLM capabilities and agentic modules essential for intricate game scenarios. To support consistent evaluation of LLMs, we introduce a plug-and-play interface based on Model Context Protocol (MCP) that enables LLMs to seamlessly connect with games and manipulate agentic modules. Additionally, we propose a fine-tuning dataset, consisting of LLM gameplay trajectories across diverse game genres. Orak offers a comprehensive evaluation framework, encompassing general game score leaderboards, LLM battle arenas, and in-depth analyses of visual input state, agentic strategies, and fine-tuning effects, establishing a foundation towards building generic gaming agents.

      Function-calling has enabled large language models (LLMs) to act as tool-using agents, but injecting thousands of tool schemas into the prompt is costly and error-prone. We introduce MCP-Zero, a proactive agent framework that lets the LLM itself decide when and which external tools to retrieve, thereby assembling a task-specific toolchain from scratch. The framework is built upon three components: (1) Proactive Tool Request, where the model emits a structured $\left<\operatorname{tool\_assistant}\right>$ block that explicitly specifies the desired server and task; (2) Hierarchical Vector Routing, a coarse-to-fine retrieval algorithm that first selects candidate servers and then ranks tools within each server based on the semantic similarity; (3) Iterative Proactive Invocation, enabling multi-round, cross-domain toolchain construction with minimal context overhead, and allowing the model to iteratively revise its request when the returned tools are insufficient. To evaluate our approach we also compile MCP-tools, a retrieval dataset comprising 308 MCP servers and 2,797 tools extracted from the official Model-Context-Protocol repository and normalized into a unified JSON schema. Experiments show that MCP-Zero (i) effectively addresses the context overhead problem of existing methods and accurately selects the correct tool from a pool of nearly 3,000 candidates (248.1k tokens); (ii) reduces token consumption by 98\% on the APIbank while maintaining high accuracy; and (iii) supports multi-turn tool invocation with consistent accuracy across rounds.

      Accelerating large language model (LLM) inference is critical for real-world deployments requiring high throughput and low latency. Contextual sparsity, where each token dynamically activates only a small subset of the model parameters, shows promise but does not scale to large batch sizes due to union of active neurons quickly approaching dense computation. We introduce Polar Sparsity, highlighting a key shift in sparsity importance from MLP to Attention layers as we scale batch size and sequence length. While MLP layers become more compute-efficient under batching, their sparsity vanishes. In contrast, attention becomes increasingly more expensive at scale, while their head sparsity remains stable and batch-invariant. We develop hardware-efficient, sparsity-aware GPU kernels for selective MLP and Attention computations, delivering up to \(2.2\times\) end-to-end speedups for models like OPT, LLaMA-2 \& 3, across various batch sizes and sequence lengths without compromising accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate that contextual sparsity can scale effectively to large batch sizes, delivering substantial inference acceleration with minimal changes, making Polar Sparsity practical for large-scale, high-throughput LLM deployment systems.

      This paper presents a systematic evaluation of Large Language Models' (LLMs) behavior on long-tail distributed (encrypted) texts and their safety implications. We introduce a two-dimensional framework for assessing LLM safety: (1) instruction refusal-the ability to reject harmful obfuscated instructions, and (2) generation safety-the suppression of generating harmful responses. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that models that possess capabilities to decrypt ciphers may be susceptible to mismatched-generalization attacks: their safety mechanisms fail on at least one safety dimension, leading to unsafe responses or over-refusal. Based on these findings, we evaluate a number of pre-LLM and post-LLM safeguards and discuss their strengths and limitations. This work contributes to understanding the safety of LLM in long-tail text scenarios and provides directions for developing robust safety mechanisms.

      Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has been gaining popularity due to its successful adaptation to large language models (LLMs). In this work, we introduce Privacy-preserving Collaborative Mixture-of-Experts (PC-MoE), which leverages the sparsity of the MoE architecture for memory-efficient decentralized collaborative LLM training, enabling multiple parties with limited GPU-memory and data resources to collectively train more capable LLMs than they could achieve individually. At the same time, this approach protects training data privacy of each participant by keeping training data, as well as parts of the forward pass signal and gradients locally within each party. By design, PC-MoE synergistically combines the strengths of distributed computation with strong confidentiality assurances. Unlike most privacy-preserving schemes, which pay for confidentiality with lower task accuracy, our framework breaks that trade-off: across seven popular LLM benchmarks, it almost matches (and sometimes exceeds) the performance and convergence rate of a fully centralized model, enjoys near 70% peak GPU RAM reduction, while being fully robust against reconstruction attacks.

      Fault localization, the process of identifying the software components responsible for failures, is essential but often time-consuming. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled fault localization without extensive defect datasets or model fine-tuning. However, existing LLM-based methods rely only on general LLM capabilities and lack integration of project-specific knowledge, resulting in limited effectiveness, especially for complex software. We introduce MemFL, a novel approach that enhances LLM-based fault localization by integrating project-specific knowledge via external memory. This memory includes static summaries of the project and dynamic, iterative debugging insights gathered from previous attempts. By leveraging external memory, MemFL simplifies debugging into three streamlined steps, significantly improving efficiency and accuracy. Iterative refinement through dynamic memory further enhances reasoning quality over time. Evaluated on the Defects4J benchmark, MemFL using GPT-4o-mini localized 12.7% more bugs than current LLM-based methods, achieving this improvement with just 21% of the execution time (17.4 seconds per bug) and 33% of the API cost (0.0033 dollars per bug). On complex projects, MemFL's advantage increased to 27.6%. Additionally, MemFL with GPT-4.1-mini outperformed existing methods by 24.4%, requiring only 24.7 seconds and 0.0094 dollars per bug. MemFL thus demonstrates significant improvements by effectively incorporating project-specific knowledge into LLM-based fault localization, delivering high accuracy with reduced time and cost.

Therefore, it is critical to extensively evaluate the linguistic robustness of LLMs on multiple non-standard English varieties. We introduce Trans-EnV, a framework that automatically transforms SAE datasets into multiple English varieties to evaluate the linguistic robustness. Our framework combines (1) linguistics expert knowledge to curate variety-specific features and transformation guidelines from linguistic literature and corpora, and (2) LLM-based transformations to ensure both linguistic validity and scalability. Using Trans-EnV, we transform six benchmark datasets into 38 English varieties and evaluate seven state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results reveal significant performance disparities, with accuracy decreasing by up to 46.3% on non-standard varieties. These findings highlight the importance of comprehensive linguistic robustness evaluation across diverse English varieties. Each construction of Trans-EnV was validated through rigorous statistical testing and consultation with a researcher in the field of second language acquisition, ensuring its linguistic validity.

Building on these innovations, our CogniPair platform enables digital twins to engage in realistic simulated dating interactions and job interviews before real encounters, providing bidirectional cultural fit assessment for both romantic compatibility and workplace matching. Validation using 551 GNWT-Agents and Columbia University Speed Dating dataset demonstrates 72% correlation with human attraction patterns, 77.8% match prediction accuracy, and 74% agreement in human validation studies.

To address these issues, we systematically eatablish an HPB disease evaluation benchmark comprising 3,535 closed-ended multiple-choice questions and 337 open-ended real diagnosis cases, which encompasses all the 33 main categories and 465 subcategories of HPB diseases defined in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10). The multiple-choice questions are curated from public datasets and synthesized data, and the clinical cases are collected from prestigious medical journals, case-sharing platforms, and collaborating hospitals. By evalauting commercial and open-source general and medical LLMs on our established benchmark, namely ClinBench-HBP, we find that while commercial LLMs perform competently on medical exam questions, they exhibit substantial performance degradation on HPB diagnosis tasks, especially on complex, inpatient clinical cases. Those medical LLMs also show limited generalizability to HPB diseases. Our results reveal the critical limitations of current LLMs in the domain of HPB diseases, underscoring the imperative need for future medical LLMs to handle real, complex clinical diagnostics rather than simple medical exam questions.

      Ensuring the robustness of code generated by large language models (LLMs) is crucial for real-world reliability. However, existing evaluations predominantly focus on correctness, often neglecting key robustness concerns such as missing input validation and insufficient error handling. In this paper, we present the first empirical study on the robustness of LLM-generated code. We introduce novel robustness metrics and analyze four state-of-the-art code LLMs, revealing that, on average, 43.1% of their generated code is less robust than human-written counterparts. Notably, over 90% of robustness deficiencies stem from missing conditional checks, with 70% of these omissions occurring in the first line of code. Additionally, in 69% of cases where a conditional statement is necessary but absent, the "if" token still ranks third or higher in the model's predicted token probabilities, indicating an implicit recognition of control structures. Building on these findings, we propose RobGen, a framework designed to enhance code robustness without requiring model retraining. RobGen leverages two model-agnostic techniques: RobGen-Adj, which dynamically adjusts token probabilities during decoding to encourage the inclusion of control structures, and RobGen-Ins, which improves generated code by inserting missing conditionals after generation. Experimental results demonstrate that RobGen reduces the proportion of less robust model-generated code by 20.0%, significantly enhancing code reliability across diverse tasks. As a lightweight and adaptable solution, RobGen effectively mitigates robustness challenges in LLM-generated code. All code and data are available at https://github.com/SYSUSELab/RobGen.

      Safety, security, and compliance are essential requirements when aligning large language models (LLMs). However, many seemingly aligned LLMs are soon shown to be susceptible to jailbreak attacks. These attacks aim to circumvent the models' safety guardrails and security mechanisms by introducing jailbreak prompts into malicious queries. In response to these challenges, this paper introduces Defensive Prompt Patch (DPP), a novel prompt-based defense mechanism specifically designed to protect LLMs against such sophisticated jailbreak strategies. Unlike previous approaches, which have often compromised the utility of the model for the sake of safety, DPP is designed to achieve a minimal Attack Success Rate (ASR) while preserving the high utility of LLMs. Our method uses strategically designed interpretable suffix prompts that effectively thwart a wide range of standard and adaptive jailbreak techniques. Empirical results conducted on LLAMA-2-7B-Chat and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 models demonstrate the robustness and adaptability of DPP, showing significant reductions in ASR with negligible impact on utility. Our approach not only outperforms existing defense strategies in balancing safety and functionality, but also provides a scalable and interpretable solution applicable to various LLM platforms.

      This proposal discusses the growing challenges in reverse engineering modern software binaries, particularly those compiled from newer system programming languages such as Rust, Go, and Mojo. Traditional reverse engineering techniques, developed with a focus on C and C++, fall short when applied to these newer languages due to their reliance on outdated heuristics and failure to fully utilize the rich semantic information embedded in binary programs. These challenges are exacerbated by the limitations of current data-driven methods, which are susceptible to generating inaccurate results, commonly referred to as hallucinations. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach that integrates probabilistic binary analysis with fine-tuned large language models (LLMs). Our method systematically models the uncertainties inherent in reverse engineering, enabling more accurate reasoning about incomplete or ambiguous information. By incorporating LLMs, we extend the analysis beyond traditional heuristics, allowing for more creative and context-aware inferences, particularly for binaries from diverse programming languages. This hybrid approach not only enhances the robustness and accuracy of reverse engineering efforts but also offers a scalable solution adaptable to the rapidly evolving landscape of software development.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) often require domain-specific fine-tuning to address targeted tasks, which risks degrading their general capabilities. Maintaining a balance between domain-specific enhancements and general model utility is a key challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach named APT (Weakness Case Acquisition and Iterative Preference Training) to enhance domain-specific performance with self-generated dis-preferred weakness data (bad cases and similar cases). APT uniquely focuses on training the model using only those samples where errors occur, alongside a small, similar set of samples retrieved for this purpose. This targeted training minimizes interference with the model's existing knowledge base, effectively retaining generic capabilities. Experimental results on the LLama-2 and Mistral-V0.3 models across various benchmarks demonstrate that APT ensures no reduction in generic capacity and achieves superior performance on downstream tasks compared to various existing methods. This validates our method as an effective strategy for enhancing domain-specific capabilities without sacrificing the model's broader applicability.

      Managing long texts is challenging for large language models (LLMs) due to limited context window sizes. This study introduces UIO-LLMs, an unbiased incremental optimization approach for memory-enhanced transformers under long-context settings. We initially conceptualize the process as a streamlined encoder-decoder framework where the weights-shared encoder and decoder respectively encapsulate a context segment into memories and leverage these memories to predict outputs of the subsequent segment. Subsequently, by treating our memory-enhanced transformers as fully-connected recurrent neural networks (RNNs), we refine the training process using the Truncated Backpropagation Through Time (TBPTT) algorithm, which incorporates innovative incremental optimization techniques. These techniques not only diminish time complexity but also address the bias in gradient computation through an unbiased optimization process. UIO-LLMs successfully handle long context, such as extending the context window of Llama2-7b-chat from 4K to 100K tokens with minimal 2% additional parameters, while keeping the inference cost nearly linear as context length increases.

This setting is a gradient-based analog of usual in-context learning (ICL) and appears in some recent works. Using a multi-step reasoning task, we prove in a simplified setting that context-enhanced learning can be exponentially more sample-efficient than standard learning when the model is capable of ICL. At a mechanistic level, we find that the benefit of context-enhancement arises from a more accurate gradient learning signal. We also experimentally demonstrate that it appears hard to detect or recover learning materials that were used in the context during training. This may have implications for data security as well as copyright.

      The NLP research community has made publicly available numerous instruments for measuring representational harms caused by large language model (LLM)-based systems. These instruments have taken the form of datasets, metrics, tools, and more. In this paper, we examine the extent to which such instruments meet the needs of practitioners tasked with evaluating LLM-based systems. Via semi-structured interviews with 12 such practitioners, we find that practitioners are often unable to use publicly available instruments for measuring representational harms. We identify two types of challenges. In some cases, instruments are not useful because they do not meaningfully measure what practitioners seek to measure or are otherwise misaligned with practitioner needs. In other cases, instruments - even useful instruments - are not used by practitioners due to practical and institutional barriers impeding their uptake. Drawing on measurement theory and pragmatic measurement, we provide recommendations for addressing these challenges to better meet practitioner needs.

      Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in solving complex mathematical tasks, existing evaluation paradigms rely solely on a coarse measure of overall answer accuracy, which are insufficient for assessing their authentic capabilities. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CogMath}, which comprehensively assesses LLMs' mathematical abilities through the lens of human cognition. Specifically, inspired by psychological theories, CogMath formalizes human reasoning process into 3 stages: \emph{problem comprehension}, \emph{problem solving}, and \emph{solution summarization}. Within these stages, we investigate perspectives such as numerical calculation, knowledge, and counterfactuals, and design a total of 9 fine-grained evaluation dimensions. In each dimension, we develop an ``\emph{Inquiry}-\emph{Judge}-\emph{Reference}'' multi-agent system to generate inquiries that assess LLMs' mastery from this dimension. An LLM is considered to truly master a problem only when excelling in all inquiries from the 9 dimensions. By applying CogMath on three benchmarks, we reveal that the mathematical capabilities of 7 mainstream LLMs are overestimated by 30\%-40\%. Moreover, we locate their strengths and weaknesses across specific stages/dimensions, offering in-depth insights to further enhance their reasoning abilities.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven progress in reasoning tasks -- from program synthesis to scientific hypothesis generation -- yet their ability to handle ranked preferences and structured algorithms in combinatorial domains remains underexplored. We study matching markets, a core framework behind applications like resource allocation and ride-sharing, which require reconciling individual ranked preferences to ensure stable outcomes. We evaluate several state-of-the-art models on a hierarchy of preference-based reasoning tasks -- ranging from stable-matching generation to instability detection, instability resolution, and fine-grained preference queries -- to systematically expose their logical and algorithmic limitations in handling ranked inputs. Surprisingly, even top-performing models with advanced reasoning struggle to resolve instability in large markets, often failing to identify blocking pairs or execute algorithms iteratively. We further show that parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) significantly improves performance in small markets, but fails to bring about a similar improvement on large instances, suggesting the need for more sophisticated strategies to improve LLMs' reasoning with larger-context inputs.

      Purpose: This study proposes a framework for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with differential privacy (DP) to perform multi-abnormality classification on radiology report text. By injecting calibrated noise during fine-tuning, the framework seeks to mitigate the privacy risks associated with sensitive patient data and protect against data leakage while maintaining classification performance. Materials and Methods: We used 50,232 radiology reports from the publicly available MIMIC-CXR chest radiography and CT-RATE computed tomography datasets, collected between 2011 and 2019. Fine-tuning of LLMs was conducted to classify 14 labels from MIMIC-CXR dataset, and 18 labels from CT-RATE dataset using Differentially Private Low-Rank Adaptation (DP-LoRA) in high and moderate privacy regimes (across a range of privacy budgets = {0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0}). Model performance was evaluated using weighted F1 score across three model architectures: BERT-medium, BERT-small, and ALBERT-base. Statistical analyses compared model performance across different privacy levels to quantify the privacy-utility trade-off. Results: We observe a clear privacy-utility trade-off through our experiments on 2 different datasets and 3 different models. Under moderate privacy guarantees the DP fine-tuned models achieved comparable weighted F1 scores of 0.88 on MIMIC-CXR and 0.59 on CT-RATE, compared to non-private LoRA baselines of 0.90 and 0.78, respectively. Conclusion: Differentially private fine-tuning using LoRA enables effective and privacy-preserving multi-abnormality classification from radiology reports, addressing a key challenge in fine-tuning LLMs on sensitive medical data.
