      Unit testing plays a critical role in ensuring software correctness. However, writing unit tests manually is laborious, especially for strong typed languages like Java, motivating the need for automated approaches. Traditional methods primarily rely on search-based or randomized algorithms to generate tests that achieve high code coverage and produce regression oracles, which are derived from the program's current behavior rather than its intended functionality. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled oracle generation from natural language descriptions. However, existing LLM-based methods often require LLM fine-tuning or rely on external tools such as EvoSuite for test prefix generation. In this work, we propose CANDOR, a novel end-to-end, prompt-based LLM framework for automated JUnit test generation. CANDOR orchestrates multiple specialized LLM agents to generate JUnit tests, including both high-quality test prefixes and accurate oracles. To mitigate the notorious hallucinations in LLMs, we introduce a novel strategy that engages multiple reasoning LLMs in a panel discussion and generate accurate oracles based on consensus. Additionally, to reduce the verbosity of reasoning LLMs' outputs, we propose a novel dual-LLM pipeline to produce concise and structured oracle evaluations. Our experiments on the HumanEvalJava and LeetCodeJava datasets show that CANDOR can generate accurate oracles and is slightly better than EvoSuite in generating tests with high line coverage and clearly superior in terms of mutation score. Moreover, CANDOR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art, prompt-based test generator LLM-Empirical, achieving improvements of 15.8 to 25.1 percentage points in oracle correctness on both correct and faulty source code. Ablation studies confirm the critical contributions of key agents in improving test prefix quality and oracle accuracy.

      Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) with numerical feedback, such as scalar rewards, have significantly enhanced the complex reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite this success, we identify three key challenges encountered by RL with solely numerical feedback: performance plateaus, limited effectiveness of self-reflection, and persistent failures. We then demonstrate that RL-finetuned models, even after exhibiting performance plateaus, can generate correct refinements on persistently failed problems by leveraging natural language feedback in the form of critiques. Building on this insight, we propose Critique-GRPO, an online RL framework that integrates both natural language and numerical feedback for effective policy optimization. Critique-GRPO enables LLMs to learn from initial responses and critique-guided refinements simultaneously while maintaining exploration. Extensive experiments using Qwen2.5-7B-Base and Qwen3-8B-Base show that Critique-GRPO consistently outperforms supervised learning-based and RL-based fine-tuning approaches across eight challenging mathematical, STEM, and general reasoning tasks, improving average pass@1 scores by approximately 4.5% and 5%, respectively. Notably, Critique-GRPO surpasses a strong baseline that incorporates expert demonstrations within online RL. Further analysis reveals two critical insights about policy exploration: (1) higher entropy does not always guarantee efficient learning from exploration, and (2) longer responses do not necessarily lead to more effective exploration.

      Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) effectively enhances external knowledge integration capabilities by explicitly modeling knowledge relationships, thereby improving the factual accuracy and generation quality of Large Language Models (LLMs) in specialized domains. However, existing methods suffer from two inherent limitations: 1) Inefficient Information Aggregation: They rely on a single agent and fixed iterative patterns, making it difficult to adaptively capture multi-level textual, structural, and degree information within graph data. 2) Rigid Reasoning Mechanism: They employ preset reasoning schemes, which cannot dynamically adjust reasoning depth nor achieve precise semantic correction. To overcome these limitations, we propose Graph Counselor, an GraphRAG method based on multi-agent collaboration. This method uses the Adaptive Graph Information Extraction Module (AGIEM), where Planning, Thought, and Execution Agents work together to precisely model complex graph structures and dynamically adjust information extraction strategies, addressing the challenges of multi-level dependency modeling and adaptive reasoning depth. Additionally, the Self-Reflection with Multiple Perspectives (SR) module improves the accuracy and semantic consistency of reasoning results through self-reflection and backward reasoning mechanisms. Experiments demonstrate that Graph Counselor outperforms existing methods in multiple graph reasoning tasks, exhibiting higher reasoning accuracy and generalization ability.

      Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with visualization tasks like plotting diagrams, charts, where success depends on both code correctness and visual semantics. Existing instruction-tuning datasets lack execution-grounded supervision and offer limited support for iterative code correction, resulting in fragile and unreliable plot generation. We present VisCode-200K, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset for Python-based visualization and self-correction. It contains over 200K examples from two sources: (1) validated plotting code from open-source repositories, paired with natural language instructions and rendered plots; and (2) 45K multi-turn correction dialogues from Code-Feedback, enabling models to revise faulty code using runtime feedback. We fine-tune Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct on VisCode-200K to create VisCoder, and evaluate it on PandasPlotBench. VisCoder significantly outperforms strong open-source baselines and approaches the performance of proprietary models like GPT-4o-mini. We further adopt a self-debug evaluation protocol to assess iterative repair, demonstrating the benefits of feedback-driven learning for executable, visually accurate code generation.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs has garnered significant attention in both the mathematical and computer science communities. Recent works have made substantial progress in both Natural Language (NL) reasoning and Formal Language (FL) reasoning by leveraging the potential of pure Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods on base models. However, RL approaches struggle to impart new capabilities not presented in the base model, highlighting the need to integrate more knowledge like FL into NL math reasoning effectively. Yet, this integration is challenging due to inherent disparities in problem structure and reasoning format between NL and FL. To address these challenges, we introduce **NL-FL HybridReasoning**, an end-to-end framework designed to incorporate the FL expert into NL math problem-solving. To bridge the NL and FL input format gap, we propose the *NL-FL Problem Alignment* method, which reformulates the Question-Answering (QA) problems in NL as existence theorems in FL. Subsequently, the *Mixed Problem Input* technique we provide enables the FL reasoner to handle both QA and existence problems concurrently. Lastly, we mitigate the NL and FL output format gap in reasoning through an LLM-based *Answer Extraction* mechanism. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the **HybridReasoning** framework achieves **89.80%** and **84.34%** accuracy rates on the MATH-500 and the AMC benchmarks, surpassing the NL baseline by 4.60% and 4.82%, respectively. Notably, some problems resolved by our framework remain unsolved by the NL baseline model even under a larger number of trials.

      📅 2025-06-04
    </div>
    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Large language models (LLMs) are known to be sensitive to input phrasing, but the mechanisms by which semantic cues shape reasoning remain poorly understood. We investigate this phenomenon in the context of comparative math problems with objective ground truth, revealing a consistent and directional framing bias: logically equivalent questions containing the words ``more'', ``less'', or ``equal'' systematically steer predictions in the direction of the framing term. To study this effect, we introduce MathComp, a controlled benchmark of 300 comparison scenarios, each evaluated under 14 prompt variants across three LLM families. We find that model errors frequently reflect linguistic steering, systematic shifts toward the comparative term present in the prompt. Chain-of-thought prompting reduces these biases, but its effectiveness varies: free-form reasoning is more robust, while structured formats may preserve or reintroduce directional drift. Finally, we show that including demographic identity terms (e.g., ``a woman'', ``a Black person'') in input scenarios amplifies directional drift, despite identical underlying quantities, highlighting the interplay between semantic framing and social referents. These findings expose critical blind spots in standard evaluation and motivate framing-aware benchmarks for diagnosing reasoning robustness and fairness in LLMs.

      Several closed-source LLMs have consistently outperformed open-source alternatives in program repair tasks, primarily due to their superior reasoning capabilities and extensive pre-training. This paper introduces Repairity, a novel three-stage methodology that significantly narrows this performance gap through reasoning extraction and reinforcement learning. Our approach: (1) systematically filters high-quality reasoning traces from closed-source models using correctness verification, (2) transfers this reasoning knowledge to open-source models via supervised fine-tuning, and (3) develops reinforcement learning with LLM-based feedback to further optimize performance. Empirical evaluation across multiple program repair benchmarks demonstrates that Repairity improves the performance of Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct, a base open source LLM, by 8.68\% on average, reducing the capability gap with Claude-Sonnet3.7, a state-of-the-art closed-source model, from 10.05% to 1.35%. Ablation studies confirm that both reasoning extraction and LLM-guided reinforcement learning contribute significantly to these improvements. Our methodology generalizes effectively to additional code-related tasks, enabling organizations to leverage high-quality program repair capabilities while maintaining the customizability, transparency, and deployment flexibility inherent to open-source models.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      With the rise of AI-based code generation, customizing existing code out of natural language instructions to modify visual results -such as figures or images -has become possible, promising to reduce the need for deep programming expertise. However, even experienced developers can struggle with this task, as it requires identifying relevant code regions (feature location), generating valid code variants, and ensuring the modifications reliably align with user intent. In this paper, we introduce vTikZ, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to customize code while preserving coherent visual outcomes. Our benchmark consists of carefully curated vTikZ editing scenarios, parameterized ground truths, and a reviewing tool that leverages visual feedback to assess correctness. Empirical evaluation with stateof-the-art LLMs shows that existing solutions struggle to reliably modify code in alignment with visual intent, highlighting a gap in current AI-assisted code editing approaches. We argue that vTikZ opens new research directions for integrating LLMs with visual feedback mechanisms to improve code customization tasks in various domains beyond TikZ, including image processing, art creation, Web design, and 3D modeling.

      Extensive LLM applications demand efficient structured generations, particularly for LR(1) grammars, to produce outputs in specified formats (e.g., JSON). Existing methods primarily parse LR(1) grammars into a pushdown automaton (PDA), leading to runtime execution overhead for context-dependent token processing, especially inefficient under large inference batches. To address these issues, we propose Pre$^3$ that exploits deterministic pushdown automata (DPDA) to optimize the constrained LLM decoding efficiency. First, by precomputing prefix-conditioned edges during the preprocessing, Pre$^3$ enables ahead-of-time edge analysis and thus makes parallel transition processing possible. Second, by leveraging the prefix-conditioned edges, Pre$^3$ introduces a novel approach that transforms LR(1) transition graphs into DPDA, eliminating the need for runtime path exploration and achieving edge transitions with minimal overhead. Pre$^3$ can be seamlessly integrated into standard LLM inference frameworks, reducing time per output token (TPOT) by up to 40% and increasing throughput by up to 36% in our experiments.

      Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential for data annotation, markedly reducing the labor costs associated with downstream applications. However, existing methods mostly adopt an aggressive strategy by prompting LLM to determine a single gold label for each unlabeled sample. Due to the inherent uncertainty within LLMs, they often produce incorrect labels for difficult samples, severely compromising the data quality for downstream applications. Motivated by ambiguity aversion in human behaviors, we propose a novel candidate annotation paradigm wherein large language models are encouraged to output all possible labels when incurring uncertainty. To ensure unique labels are provided for downstream tasks, we develop a teacher-student framework CanDist that distills candidate annotations with a Small Language Model (SLM). We further provide a rigorous justification demonstrating that distilling candidate annotations from the teacher LLM offers superior theoretical guarantees compared to directly using single annotations. Extensive experiments across six text classification tasks validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The source code is available at https://github.com/MingxuanXia/CanDist.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved impressive performance across a wide range of natural language tasks and are now widely used in real-world applications. Among them, black-box LLMs--served via APIs without access to model internals--are especially dominant due to their scalability and ease of deployment. Despite their strong capabilities, these models typically produce generalized responses that overlook personal preferences and reasoning styles. This has led to growing interest in black-box LLM personalization, which aims to tailor model outputs to user-specific context without modifying model parameters. However, existing approaches primarily focus on response-level personalization, attempting to match final outputs without modeling personal thought process. To address this limitation, we propose RPM, a framework for reasoning-level personalization that aligns the model's reasoning process with a user's personalized logic. RPM first constructs statistical user-specific factors by extracting and grouping response-influential features from user history. It then builds personalized reasoning paths that reflect how these factors are used in context. In the inference stage, RPM retrieves reasoning-aligned examples for new queries via feature-level similarity and performs inference conditioned on the structured factors and retrieved reasoning paths, enabling the model to follow user-specific reasoning trajectories. This reasoning-level personalization enhances both predictive accuracy and interpretability by grounding model outputs in user-specific logic through structured information. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks show that RPM consistently outperforms response-level personalization methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of reasoning-level personalization in black-box LLMs.

      Large language models (LLMs) have majorly advanced NLP and AI, and next to their ability to perform a wide range of procedural tasks, a major success factor is their internalized factual knowledge. Since Petroni et al. (2019), analyzing this knowledge has gained attention. However, most approaches investigate one question at a time via modest-sized pre-defined samples, introducing an ``availability bias'' (Tversky&Kahnemann, 1973) that prevents the analysis of knowledge (or beliefs) of LLMs beyond the experimenter's predisposition. To address this challenge, we propose a novel methodology to comprehensively materialize an LLM's factual knowledge through recursive querying and result consolidation. Our approach is a milestone for LLM research, for the first time providing constructive insights into the scope and structure of LLM knowledge (or beliefs). As a prototype, we build GPTKB, a knowledge base (KB) comprising 101 million relational triples for over 2.9 million entities from GPT-4o-mini. We use GPTKB to exemplarily analyze GPT-4o-mini's factual knowledge in terms of scale, accuracy, bias, cutoff and consistency, at the same time. GPTKB is accessible at https://gptkb.org

      Traditional Business Process Management (BPM) struggles with rigidity, opacity, and scalability in dynamic environments while emerging Large Language Models (LLMs) present transformative opportunities alongside risks. This paper explores four real-world use cases that demonstrate how LLMs, augmented with trustworthy process intelligence, redefine process modeling, prediction, and automation. Grounded in early-stage research projects with industrial partners, the work spans manufacturing, modeling, life-science, and design processes, addressing domain-specific challenges through human-AI collaboration. In manufacturing, an LLM-driven framework integrates uncertainty-aware explainable Machine Learning (ML) with interactive dialogues, transforming opaque predictions into auditable workflows. For process modeling, conversational interfaces democratize BPMN design. Pharmacovigilance agents automate drug safety monitoring via knowledge-graph-augmented LLMs. Finally, sustainable textile design employs multi-agent systems to navigate regulatory and environmental trade-offs. We intend to examine tensions between transparency and efficiency, generalization and specialization, and human agency versus automation. By mapping these trade-offs, we advocate for context-sensitive integration prioritizing domain needs, stakeholder values, and iterative human-in-the-loop workflows over universal solutions. This work provides actionable insights for researchers and practitioners aiming to operationalize LLMs in critical BPM environments.

      Query expansion methods powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness in zero-shot retrieval tasks. These methods assume that LLMs can generate hypothetical documents that, when incorporated into a query vector, enhance the retrieval of real evidence. However, we challenge this assumption by investigating whether knowledge leakage in benchmarks contributes to the observed performance gains. Using fact verification as a testbed, we analyze whether the generated documents contain information entailed by ground-truth evidence and assess their impact on performance. Our findings indicate that, on average, performance improvements consistently occurred for claims whose generated documents included sentences entailed by gold evidence. This suggests that knowledge leakage may be present in fact-verification benchmarks, potentially inflating the perceived performance of LLM-based query expansion methods.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for long-content generation (e.g., long Chain-of-Thought reasoning) where decoding efficiency becomes a critical bottleneck: Autoregressive decoding is inherently limited by its sequential token generation process, where each token must be generated before the next can be processed. This sequential dependency restricts the ability to fully leverage modern hardware's parallel processing capabilities. Existing methods like speculative decoding and layer skipping offer potential speedups but have notable drawbacks: speculative decoding relies on an auxiliary "drafter" model, which can be challenging to acquire and increases memory overhead, while layer skipping may introduce discrepancies in the outputs due to the missing key-value cache at skipped layers. In this work, we propose AdaDecode, which accelerates LLM decoding without requiring auxiliary models or changes to the original model parameters, while ensuring output consistency. AdaDecode leverages the insight that many tokens can accurately be generated at intermediate layers, as further layers often do not significantly alter predictions once the model reaches a certain confidence. By adaptively generating tokens at intermediate layers when confidence is high, AdaDecode enables the next token's computation to begin immediately. The remaining layer computations for early-predicted tokens are deferred and executed in parallel with subsequent tokens when needed, maximizing hardware utilization and reducing decoding latency. A final verification step ensures that early predictions match the results of standard autoregressive decoding, preserving output parity. Experiments across diverse generation tasks shows that AdaDecode consistently achieves superior decoding throughput with up to 1.73x speedup, while guaranteeing output parity with standard autoregressive decoding.

      Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are pivotal to modern software engineering, yet diagnosing and resolving their failures remains a complex and labor-intensive challenge. In this paper, we present LogSage, the first end-to-end LLM-powered framework that performs root cause analysis and solution generation from failed CI/CD pipeline logs. During the root cause analysis stage, LogSage employs a specialized log preprocessing pipeline tailored for LLMs, which extracts critical error logs and eliminates noise to enhance the precision of LLM-driven root cause analysis. In the solution generation stage, LogSage leverages RAG to integrate historical resolution strategies and utilizes tool-calling to deliver actionable, automated fixes. We evaluated the root cause analysis stage using a newly curated open-source dataset, achieving 98\% in precision and 12\% improvement over naively designed LLM-based log analysis baselines, while attaining near-perfect recall. The end-to-end system was rigorously validated in a large-scale industrial CI/CD environment of production quality, processing more than 3,000 executions daily and accumulating more than 1.07 million executions in its first year of deployment, with end-to-end precision exceeding 88\%.

      Discourse understanding is essential for many NLP tasks, yet most existing work remains constrained by framework-dependent discourse representations. This work investigates whether large language models (LLMs) capture discourse knowledge that generalizes across languages and frameworks. We address this question along two dimensions: (1) developing a unified discourse relation label set to facilitate cross-lingual and cross-framework discourse analysis, and (2) probing LLMs to assess whether they encode generalizable discourse abstractions. Using multilingual discourse relation classification as a testbed, we examine a comprehensive set of 23 LLMs of varying sizes and multilingual capabilities. Our results show that LLMs, especially those with multilingual training corpora, can generalize discourse information across languages and frameworks. Further layer-wise analyses reveal that language generalization at the discourse level is most salient in the intermediate layers. Lastly, our error analysis provides an account of challenging relation classes.

      Despite rapid advancements in the research and deployment of large language models (LLMs), the statistical distribution of model parameters, as well as their influence on initialization, training dynamics, and downstream efficiency, has received surprisingly little attention. A recent work introduced BackSlash, a training-time compression algorithm. It first demonstrated that pre-trained LLM parameters follow generalized Gaussian distributions (GGDs) better. By optimizing GG priors during training, BackSlash can reduce parameters by up to 90\% with minimal performance loss. Building on this foundational insight, we propose a unified, end-to-end framework for LLM optimization based on the GG model. Our contributions are threefold: (1) GG-based initialization scheme that aligns with the statistical structure of trained models, resulting in faster convergence and improved accuracy; (2) DeepShape, a post-training regularization method that reshapes weight distributions to match a GG profile, improving compressibility with minimized degradation in performance; and (3) RF8, a compact and hardware-efficient 8-bit floating-point format designed for GG-distributed-initialized BackSlash training, enabling low-cost inference without compromising accuracy. Experiments across diverse model architectures show that our framework consistently yields smaller and faster models that match or outperform standard training baselines. By grounding LLM development in principled statistical modeling, this work forges a new path toward efficient, scalable, and hardware-aware AI systems.

      Formal logic enables computers to reason in natural language by representing sentences in symbolic forms and applying rules to derive conclusions. However, in what our study characterizes as "rulebreaker" scenarios, this method can lead to conclusions that are typically not inferred or accepted by humans given their common sense and factual knowledge. Inspired by works in cognitive science, we create RULEBREAKERS, the first dataset for rigorously evaluating the ability of large language models (LLMs) to recognize and respond to rulebreakers (versus non-rulebreakers) in a human-like manner. Evaluating seven LLMs, we find that most models, including GPT-4o, achieve mediocre accuracy on RULEBREAKERS and exhibit some tendency to over-rigidly apply logical rules unlike what is expected from typical human reasoners. Further analysis suggests that this apparent failure is potentially associated with the models' poor utilization of their world knowledge and their attention distribution patterns. Whilst revealing a limitation of current LLMs, our study also provides a timely counterbalance to a growing body of recent works that propose methods relying on formal logic to improve LLMs' general reasoning capabilities, highlighting their risk of further increasing divergence between LLMs and human-like reasoning.

      Auto-vectorization is a fundamental optimization for modern compilers to exploit SIMD parallelism. However, state-of-the-art approaches still struggle to handle intricate code patterns, often requiring manual hints or domain-specific expertise. Large language models (LLMs), with their ability to capture intricate patterns, provide a promising solution, yet their effective application in compiler optimizations remains an open challenge due to issues such as hallucinations and a lack of domain-specific reasoning. In this paper, we present VecTrans, a novel framework that leverages LLMs to enhance compiler-based code vectorization. VecTrans first employs compiler analysis to identify potentially vectorizable code regions. It then utilizes an LLM to refactor these regions into patterns that are more amenable to the compilers auto-vectorization. To ensure semantic correctness, VecTrans further integrates a hybrid validation mechanism at the intermediate representation (IR) level. With the above efforts, VecTrans combines the adaptability of LLMs with the precision of compiler vectorization, thereby effectively opening up the vectorization opportunities. experimental results show that among all TSVC functions unvectorizable by GCC, ICC, Clang, and BiSheng Compiler, VecTrans achieves an geomean speedup of 1.77x and successfully vectorizes 24 of 51 test cases. This marks a significant advancement over state-of-the-art approaches while maintaining a cost efficiency of $0.012 per function optimization for LLM API usage.

      Malicious websites and phishing URLs pose an ever-increasing cybersecurity risk, with phishing attacks growing by 40% in a single year. Traditional detection approaches rely on machine learning classifiers or rule-based scanners operating in the cloud, but these face significant challenges in generalization, privacy, and evasion by sophisticated threats. In this paper, we propose a novel client-side framework for comprehensive URL analysis that leverages zero-shot inference by a local large language model (LLM) running entirely in-browser. Our system uses a compact LLM (e.g., 3B/8B parameters) via WebLLM to perform reasoning over rich context collected from the target webpage, including static code analysis (JavaScript abstract syntax trees, structure, and code patterns), dynamic sandbox execution results (DOM changes, API calls, and network requests),and visible content. We detail the architecture and methodology of the system, which combines a real browser sandbox (using iframes) resistant to common anti-analysis techniques, with an LLM-based analyzer that assesses potential vulnerabilities and malicious behaviors without any task-specific training (zero-shot). The LLM aggregates evidence from multiple sources (code, execution trace, page content) to classify the URL as benign or malicious and to provide an explanation of the threats or security issues identified. We evaluate our approach on a diverse set of benign and malicious URLs, demonstrating that even a compact client-side model can achieve high detection accuracy and insightful explanations comparable to cloud-based solutions, while operating privately on end-user devices. The results show that client-side LLM inference is a feasible and effective solution to web threat analysis, eliminating the need to send potentially sensitive data to cloud services.

Through a comprehensive evaluation of five prominent Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4o, GPT-3.5 Turbo, LLaMA 3.1, and Mixtral 8x7B, we identify significant performance gaps between different languages and topics.

      Fine-tuning LLMs on tabular classification tasks can lead to the phenomenon of fine-tuning multiplicity where equally well-performing models make conflicting predictions on the same input. Fine-tuning multiplicity can arise due to variations in the training process, e.g., seed, weight initialization, minor changes to training data, etc., raising concerns about the reliability of Tabular LLMs in high-stakes applications such as finance, hiring, education, healthcare. Our work formalizes this unique challenge of fine-tuning multiplicity in Tabular LLMs and proposes a novel measure to quantify the consistency of individual predictions without expensive model retraining. Our measure quantifies a prediction's consistency by analyzing (sampling) the model's local behavior around that input in the embedding space. Interestingly, we show that sampling in the local neighborhood can be leveraged to provide probabilistic guarantees on prediction consistency under a broad class of fine-tuned models, i.e., inputs with sufficiently high local stability (as defined by our measure) also remain consistent across several fine-tuned models with high probability. We perform experiments on multiple real-world datasets to show that our local stability measure preemptively captures consistency under actual multiplicity across several fine-tuned models, outperforming competing measures.

      Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited their problem-solving abilities in mathematical reasoning. Solving realistic optimization (OPT) problems in application scenarios requires advanced and applied mathematics ability. However, current OPT benchmarks that merely solve linear programming are far from complex realistic situations. In this work, we propose OptiBench, a benchmark for End-to-end optimization problem-solving with human-readable inputs and outputs. OptiBench contains rich optimization problems, including linear and nonlinear programming with or without tabular data, which can comprehensively evaluate LLMs' solving ability. In our benchmark, LLMs are required to call a code solver to provide precise numerical answers. Furthermore, to alleviate the data scarcity for optimization problems, and to bridge the gap between open-source LLMs on a small scale (e.g., Llama-3-8b) and closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4), we further propose a data synthesis method namely ReSocratic. Unlike general data synthesis methods that proceed from questions to answers, \ReSocratic first incrementally synthesizes formatted optimization demonstration with mathematical formulations step by step and then back-translates the generated demonstrations into questions. Based on this, we synthesize the ReSocratic-29k dataset. We further conduct supervised fine-tuning with ReSocratic-29k on multiple open-source models. Experimental results show that ReSocratic-29k significantly improves the performance of open-source models.

      Conventional biomedical research is increasingly labor-intensive due to the exponential growth of scientific literature and datasets. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has the potential to revolutionize this process by automating various steps. Still, significant challenges remain, including the need for multidisciplinary expertise, logicality of experimental design, and performance measurements. This paper introduces BioResearcher, the first end-to-end automated system designed to streamline the entire biomedical research process involving dry lab experiments. BioResearcher employs a modular multi-agent architecture, integrating specialized agents for search, literature processing, experimental design, and programming. By decomposing complex tasks into logically related sub-tasks and utilizing a hierarchical learning approach, BioResearcher effectively addresses the challenges of multidisciplinary requirements and logical complexity. Furthermore, BioResearcher incorporates an LLM-based reviewer for in-process quality control and introduces novel evaluation metrics to assess the quality and automation of experimental protocols. BioResearcher successfully achieves an average execution success rate of 63.07% across eight previously unmet research objectives. The generated protocols averagely outperform typical agent systems by 22.0% on five quality metrics. The system demonstrates significant potential to reduce researchers' workloads and accelerate biomedical discoveries, paving the way for future innovations in automated research systems.

      Large Language Model (LLM) agents are reshaping the game industry, particularly with more intelligent and human-preferable game characters. However, existing game benchmarks fall short of practical needs: they lack evaluations of diverse LLM capabilities across various game genres, studies of agentic modules crucial for complex gameplay, and fine-tuning datasets for aligning pre-trained LLMs into gaming agents. To fill these gaps, we present \textbf{\benchname{}}, a foundational benchmark designed to train and evaluate LLM agents across diverse real-world video games. Unlike existing benchmarks, Orak includes 12 popular video games spanning all major genres, enabling comprehensive studies of LLM capabilities and agentic modules essential for intricate game scenarios.

Additionally, we propose a fine-tuning dataset, consisting of LLM gameplay trajectories across diverse game genres.

      Function-calling has enabled large language models (LLMs) to act as tool-using agents, but injecting thousands of tool schemas into the prompt is costly and error-prone. We introduce MCP-Zero, a proactive agent framework that lets the LLM itself decide when and which external tools to retrieve, thereby assembling a task-specific toolchain from scratch. The framework is built upon three components: (1) Proactive Tool Request, where the model emits a structured $\left<\operatorname{tool\_assistant}\right>$ block that explicitly specifies the desired server and task; (2) Hierarchical Vector Routing, a coarse-to-fine retrieval algorithm that first selects candidate servers and then ranks tools within each server based on the semantic similarity; (3) Iterative Proactive Invocation, enabling multi-round, cross-domain toolchain construction with minimal context overhead, and allowing the model to iteratively revise its request when the returned tools are insufficient. To evaluate our approach we also compile MCP-tools, a retrieval dataset comprising 308 MCP servers and 2,797 tools extracted from the official Model-Context-Protocol repository and normalized into a unified JSON schema. Experiments show that MCP-Zero (i) effectively addresses the context overhead problem of existing methods and accurately selects the correct tool from a pool of nearly 3,000 candidates (248.1k tokens); (ii) reduces token consumption by 98\% on the APIbank while maintaining high accuracy; and (iii) supports multi-turn tool invocation with consistent accuracy across rounds.

      Accelerating large language model (LLM) inference is critical for real-world deployments requiring high throughput and low latency. Contextual sparsity, where each token dynamically activates only a small subset of the model parameters, shows promise but does not scale to large batch sizes due to union of active neurons quickly approaching dense computation. We introduce Polar Sparsity, highlighting a key shift in sparsity importance from MLP to Attention layers as we scale batch size and sequence length. While MLP layers become more compute-efficient under batching, their sparsity vanishes. In contrast, attention becomes increasingly more expensive at scale, while their head sparsity remains stable and batch-invariant. We develop hardware-efficient, sparsity-aware GPU kernels for selective MLP and Attention computations, delivering up to \(2.2\times\) end-to-end speedups for models like OPT, LLaMA-2 \& 3, across various batch sizes and sequence lengths without compromising accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate that contextual sparsity can scale effectively to large batch sizes, delivering substantial inference acceleration with minimal changes, making Polar Sparsity practical for large-scale, high-throughput LLM deployment systems.

We introduce a two-dimensional framework for assessing LLM safety: (1) instruction refusal-the ability to reject harmful obfuscated instructions, and (2) generation safety-the suppression of generating harmful responses. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that models that possess capabilities to decrypt ciphers may be susceptible to mismatched-generalization attacks: their safety mechanisms fail on at least one safety dimension, leading to unsafe responses or over-refusal. Based on these findings, we evaluate a number of pre-LLM and post-LLM safeguards and discuss their strengths and limitations. This work contributes to understanding the safety of LLM in long-tail text scenarios and provides directions for developing robust safety mechanisms.

      Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has been gaining popularity due to its successful adaptation to large language models (LLMs). In this work, we introduce Privacy-preserving Collaborative Mixture-of-Experts (PC-MoE), which leverages the sparsity of the MoE architecture for memory-efficient decentralized collaborative LLM training, enabling multiple parties with limited GPU-memory and data resources to collectively train more capable LLMs than they could achieve individually. At the same time, this approach protects training data privacy of each participant by keeping training data, as well as parts of the forward pass signal and gradients locally within each party. By design, PC-MoE synergistically combines the strengths of distributed computation with strong confidentiality assurances. Unlike most privacy-preserving schemes, which pay for confidentiality with lower task accuracy, our framework breaks that trade-off: across seven popular LLM benchmarks, it almost matches (and sometimes exceeds) the performance and convergence rate of a fully centralized model, enjoys near 70% peak GPU RAM reduction, while being fully robust against reconstruction attacks.

      Fault localization, the process of identifying the software components responsible for failures, is essential but often time-consuming. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled fault localization without extensive defect datasets or model fine-tuning. However, existing LLM-based methods rely only on general LLM capabilities and lack integration of project-specific knowledge, resulting in limited effectiveness, especially for complex software. We introduce MemFL, a novel approach that enhances LLM-based fault localization by integrating project-specific knowledge via external memory. This memory includes static summaries of the project and dynamic, iterative debugging insights gathered from previous attempts. By leveraging external memory, MemFL simplifies debugging into three streamlined steps, significantly improving efficiency and accuracy. Iterative refinement through dynamic memory further enhances reasoning quality over time. Evaluated on the Defects4J benchmark, MemFL using GPT-4o-mini localized 12.7% more bugs than current LLM-based methods, achieving this improvement with just 21% of the execution time (17.4 seconds per bug) and 33% of the API cost (0.0033 dollars per bug). On complex projects, MemFL's advantage increased to 27.6%. Additionally, MemFL with GPT-4.1-mini outperformed existing methods by 24.4%, requiring only 24.7 seconds and 0.0094 dollars per bug. MemFL thus demonstrates significant improvements by effectively incorporating project-specific knowledge into LLM-based fault localization, delivering high accuracy with reduced time and cost.

To address these issues, we systematically eatablish an HPB disease evaluation benchmark comprising 3,535 closed-ended multiple-choice questions and 337 open-ended real diagnosis cases, which encompasses all the 33 main categories and 465 subcategories of HPB diseases defined in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10).

      Ensuring the robustness of code generated by large language models (LLMs) is crucial for real-world reliability. However, existing evaluations predominantly focus on correctness, often neglecting key robustness concerns such as missing input validation and insufficient error handling. In this paper, we present the first empirical study on the robustness of LLM-generated code. We introduce novel robustness metrics and analyze four state-of-the-art code LLMs, revealing that, on average, 43.1% of their generated code is less robust than human-written counterparts. Notably, over 90% of robustness deficiencies stem from missing conditional checks, with 70% of these omissions occurring in the first line of code. Additionally, in 69% of cases where a conditional statement is necessary but absent, the "if" token still ranks third or higher in the model's predicted token probabilities, indicating an implicit recognition of control structures. Building on these findings, we propose RobGen, a framework designed to enhance code robustness without requiring model retraining. RobGen leverages two model-agnostic techniques: RobGen-Adj, which dynamically adjusts token probabilities during decoding to encourage the inclusion of control structures, and RobGen-Ins, which improves generated code by inserting missing conditionals after generation. Experimental results demonstrate that RobGen reduces the proportion of less robust model-generated code by 20.0%, significantly enhancing code reliability across diverse tasks. As a lightweight and adaptable solution, RobGen effectively mitigates robustness challenges in LLM-generated code. All code and data are available at https://github.com/SYSUSELab/RobGen.

      Safety, security, and compliance are essential requirements when aligning large language models (LLMs). However, many seemingly aligned LLMs are soon shown to be susceptible to jailbreak attacks. These attacks aim to circumvent the models' safety guardrails and security mechanisms by introducing jailbreak prompts into malicious queries. In response to these challenges, this paper introduces Defensive Prompt Patch (DPP), a novel prompt-based defense mechanism specifically designed to protect LLMs against such sophisticated jailbreak strategies. Unlike previous approaches, which have often compromised the utility of the model for the sake of safety, DPP is designed to achieve a minimal Attack Success Rate (ASR) while preserving the high utility of LLMs. Our method uses strategically designed interpretable suffix prompts that effectively thwart a wide range of standard and adaptive jailbreak techniques. Empirical results conducted on LLAMA-2-7B-Chat and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 models demonstrate the robustness and adaptability of DPP, showing significant reductions in ASR with negligible impact on utility. Our approach not only outperforms existing defense strategies in balancing safety and functionality, but also provides a scalable and interpretable solution applicable to various LLM platforms.

      This proposal discusses the growing challenges in reverse engineering modern software binaries, particularly those compiled from newer system programming languages such as Rust, Go, and Mojo. Traditional reverse engineering techniques, developed with a focus on C and C++, fall short when applied to these newer languages due to their reliance on outdated heuristics and failure to fully utilize the rich semantic information embedded in binary programs. These challenges are exacerbated by the limitations of current data-driven methods, which are susceptible to generating inaccurate results, commonly referred to as hallucinations. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach that integrates probabilistic binary analysis with fine-tuned large language models (LLMs). Our method systematically models the uncertainties inherent in reverse engineering, enabling more accurate reasoning about incomplete or ambiguous information. By incorporating LLMs, we extend the analysis beyond traditional heuristics, allowing for more creative and context-aware inferences, particularly for binaries from diverse programming languages. This hybrid approach not only enhances the robustness and accuracy of reverse engineering efforts but also offers a scalable solution adaptable to the rapidly evolving landscape of software development.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) often require domain-specific fine-tuning to address targeted tasks, which risks degrading their general capabilities. Maintaining a balance between domain-specific enhancements and general model utility is a key challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach named APT (Weakness Case Acquisition and Iterative Preference Training) to enhance domain-specific performance with self-generated dis-preferred weakness data (bad cases and similar cases). APT uniquely focuses on training the model using only those samples where errors occur, alongside a small, similar set of samples retrieved for this purpose. This targeted training minimizes interference with the model's existing knowledge base, effectively retaining generic capabilities. Experimental results on the LLama-2 and Mistral-V0.3 models across various benchmarks demonstrate that APT ensures no reduction in generic capacity and achieves superior performance on downstream tasks compared to various existing methods. This validates our method as an effective strategy for enhancing domain-specific capabilities without sacrificing the model's broader applicability.

      Managing long texts is challenging for large language models (LLMs) due to limited context window sizes. This study introduces UIO-LLMs, an unbiased incremental optimization approach for memory-enhanced transformers under long-context settings. We initially conceptualize the process as a streamlined encoder-decoder framework where the weights-shared encoder and decoder respectively encapsulate a context segment into memories and leverage these memories to predict outputs of the subsequent segment. Subsequently, by treating our memory-enhanced transformers as fully-connected recurrent neural networks (RNNs), we refine the training process using the Truncated Backpropagation Through Time (TBPTT) algorithm, which incorporates innovative incremental optimization techniques. These techniques not only diminish time complexity but also address the bias in gradient computation through an unbiased optimization process. UIO-LLMs successfully handle long context, such as extending the context window of Llama2-7b-chat from 4K to 100K tokens with minimal 2% additional parameters, while keeping the inference cost nearly linear as context length increases.

      User-item interactions contain rich collaborative signals that form the backbone of many successful recommender systems. While recent work has explored the use of large language models (LLMs) for recommendation, it remains unclear whether LLMs can effectively reason over this type of collaborative information. In this paper, we conduct a systematic comparison between LLMs and classical matrix factorization (MF) models to assess LLMs' ability to leverage user-item interaction data. We further introduce a simple retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method that enhances LLMs by grounding their predictions in structured interaction data. Our experiments reveal that current LLMs often fall short in capturing collaborative patterns inherent to MF models, but that our RAG-based approach substantially improves recommendation quality-highlighting a promising direction for future LLM-based recommenders.

      We formalize a new concept for LLMs, context-enhanced learning. It involves standard gradient-based learning on text except that the context is enhanced with additional data on which no auto-regressive gradients are computed. This setting is a gradient-based analog of usual in-context learning (ICL) and appears in some recent works. Using a multi-step reasoning task, we prove in a simplified setting that context-enhanced learning can be exponentially more sample-efficient than standard learning when the model is capable of ICL. At a mechanistic level, we find that the benefit of context-enhancement arises from a more accurate gradient learning signal. We also experimentally demonstrate that it appears hard to detect or recover learning materials that were used in the context during training. This may have implications for data security as well as copyright.

      The NLP research community has made publicly available numerous instruments for measuring representational harms caused by large language model (LLM)-based systems. These instruments have taken the form of datasets, metrics, tools, and more. In this paper, we examine the extent to which such instruments meet the needs of practitioners tasked with evaluating LLM-based systems. Via semi-structured interviews with 12 such practitioners, we find that practitioners are often unable to use publicly available instruments for measuring representational harms. We identify two types of challenges. In some cases, instruments are not useful because they do not meaningfully measure what practitioners seek to measure or are otherwise misaligned with practitioner needs. In other cases, instruments - even useful instruments - are not used by practitioners due to practical and institutional barriers impeding their uptake. Drawing on measurement theory and pragmatic measurement, we provide recommendations for addressing these challenges to better meet practitioner needs.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in solving complex mathematical tasks, existing evaluation paradigms rely solely on a coarse measure of overall answer accuracy, which are insufficient for assessing their authentic capabilities. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CogMath}, which comprehensively assesses LLMs' mathematical abilities through the lens of human cognition. Specifically, inspired by psychological theories, CogMath formalizes human reasoning process into 3 stages: \emph{problem comprehension}, \emph{problem solving}, and \emph{solution summarization}. Within these stages, we investigate perspectives such as numerical calculation, knowledge, and counterfactuals, and design a total of 9 fine-grained evaluation dimensions. In each dimension, we develop an ``\emph{Inquiry}-\emph{Judge}-\emph{Reference}'' multi-agent system to generate inquiries that assess LLMs' mastery from this dimension. An LLM is considered to truly master a problem only when excelling in all inquiries from the 9 dimensions. By applying CogMath on three benchmarks, we reveal that the mathematical capabilities of 7 mainstream LLMs are overestimated by 30\%-40\%. Moreover, we locate their strengths and weaknesses across specific stages/dimensions, offering in-depth insights to further enhance their reasoning abilities.

      The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven progress in reasoning tasks -- from program synthesis to scientific hypothesis generation -- yet their ability to handle ranked preferences and structured algorithms in combinatorial domains remains underexplored. We study matching markets, a core framework behind applications like resource allocation and ride-sharing, which require reconciling individual ranked preferences to ensure stable outcomes. We evaluate several state-of-the-art models on a hierarchy of preference-based reasoning tasks -- ranging from stable-matching generation to instability detection, instability resolution, and fine-grained preference queries -- to systematically expose their logical and algorithmic limitations in handling ranked inputs. Surprisingly, even top-performing models with advanced reasoning struggle to resolve instability in large markets, often failing to identify blocking pairs or execute algorithms iteratively. We further show that parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) significantly improves performance in small markets, but fails to bring about a similar improvement on large instances, suggesting the need for more sophisticated strategies to improve LLMs' reasoning with larger-context inputs.

      Purpose: This study proposes a framework for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with differential privacy (DP) to perform multi-abnormality classification on radiology report text. By injecting calibrated noise during fine-tuning, the framework seeks to mitigate the privacy risks associated with sensitive patient data and protect against data leakage while maintaining classification performance. Materials and Methods: We used 50,232 radiology reports from the publicly available MIMIC-CXR chest radiography and CT-RATE computed tomography datasets, collected between 2011 and 2019. Fine-tuning of LLMs was conducted to classify 14 labels from MIMIC-CXR dataset, and 18 labels from CT-RATE dataset using Differentially Private Low-Rank Adaptation (DP-LoRA) in high and moderate privacy regimes (across a range of privacy budgets = {0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0}). Model performance was evaluated using weighted F1 score across three model architectures: BERT-medium, BERT-small, and ALBERT-base. Statistical analyses compared model performance across different privacy levels to quantify the privacy-utility trade-off. Results: We observe a clear privacy-utility trade-off through our experiments on 2 different datasets and 3 different models. Under moderate privacy guarantees the DP fine-tuned models achieved comparable weighted F1 scores of 0.88 on MIMIC-CXR and 0.59 on CT-RATE, compared to non-private LoRA baselines of 0.90 and 0.78, respectively. Conclusion: Differentially private fine-tuning using LoRA enables effective and privacy-preserving multi-abnormality classification from radiology reports, addressing a key challenge in fine-tuning LLMs on sensitive medical data.

      Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in table Question Answering (Table QA). However, extending these capabilities to multi-table QA remains challenging due to unreliable schema linking across complex tables. Existing methods based on semantic similarity work well only on simplified hand-crafted datasets and struggle to handle complex, real-world scenarios with numerous and diverse columns. To address this, we propose a graph-based framework that leverages human-curated relational knowledge to explicitly encode schema links and join paths. Given a natural language query, our method searches this graph to construct interpretable reasoning chains, aided by pruning and sub-path merging strategies to enhance efficiency and coherence. Experiments on both standard benchmarks and a realistic, large-scale dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. To our knowledge, this is the first multi-table QA system applied to truly complex industrial tabular data.

      Multi-hunk bugs, where fixes span disjoint regions of code, are common in practice, yet remain underrepresented in automated repair. Existing techniques and benchmarks pre-dominantly target single-hunk scenarios, overlooking the added complexity of coordinating semantically related changes across the codebase. In this work, we characterize HUNK4J, a dataset of multi-hunk patches derived from 372 real-world defects. We propose hunk divergence, a metric that quantifies the variation among edits in a patch by capturing lexical, structural, and file-level differences, while incorporating the number of hunks involved. We further define spatial proximity, a classification that models how hunks are spatially distributed across the program hierarchy. Our empirical study spanning six LLMs reveals that model success rates decline with increased divergence and spatial dispersion. Notably, when using the LLM alone, no model succeeds in the most dispersed Fragment class. These findings highlight a critical gap in LLM capabilities and motivate divergence-aware repair strategies.

      Recent studies have shown that vector representations of contextual embeddings learned by pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are effective in various downstream tasks in numerical domains. Despite their significant benefits, the tendency of LLMs to hallucinate in such domains can have severe consequences in applications such as energy, nature, finance, healthcare, retail and transportation, among others. To guarantee prediction reliability and accuracy in numerical domains, it is necessary to open the black-box and provide performance guarantees through explanation. However, there is little theoretical understanding of when pre-trained language models help solve numeric downstream tasks. This paper seeks to bridge this gap by understanding when the next-word prediction capability of LLMs can be adapted to numerical domains through a novel analysis based on the concept of isotropy in the contextual embedding space. Specifically, we consider a log-linear model for LLMs in which numeric data can be predicted from its context through a network with softmax in the output layer of LLMs (i.e., language model head in self-attention). We demonstrate that, in order to achieve state-of-the-art performance in numerical domains, the hidden representations of the LLM embeddings must possess a structure that accounts for the shift-invariance of the softmax function. By formulating a gradient structure of self-attention in pre-trained models, we show how the isotropic property of LLM embeddings in contextual embedding space preserves the underlying structure of representations, thereby resolving the shift-invariance problem and providing a performance guarantee. Experiments show that different characteristics of numeric data and model architecture could have different impacts on isotropy.

      Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable successes on various tasks. However, recent studies have found that there are still significant challenges to the logical reasoning abilities of LLMs, which can be categorized into the following two aspects: (1) Logical question answering: LLMs often fail to generate the correct answer within a complex logical problem which requires sophisticated deductive, inductive or abductive reasoning given a collection of premises and constrains. (2) Logical consistency: LLMs are prone to producing responses contradicting themselves across different questions. For example, a state-of-the-art question-answering LLM Macaw, answers Yes to both questions Is a magpie a bird? and Does a bird have wings? but answers No to Does a magpie have wings?. To facilitate this research direction, we comprehensively investigate the most cutting-edge methods and propose a detailed taxonomy. Specifically, to accurately answer complex logic questions, previous methods can be categorized based on reliance on external solvers, prompts, and fine-tuning. To avoid logical contradictions, we discuss concepts and solutions of various logical consistencies, including implication, negation, transitivity, factuality consistencies, and their composites. In addition, we review commonly used benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics, and discuss promising research directions, such as extending to modal logic to account for uncertainty and developing efficient algorithms that simultaneously satisfy multiple logical consistencies.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      In this work, we investigate the causal reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) through the representative problem of inferring causal relationships from narratives. We find that even state-of-the-art language models rely on unreliable shortcuts, both in terms of the narrative presentation and their parametric knowledge. For example, LLMs tend to determine causal relationships based on the topological ordering of events (i.e., earlier events cause later ones), resulting in lower performance whenever events are not narrated in their exact causal order. Similarly, we demonstrate that LLMs struggle with long-term causal reasoning and often fail when the narratives are long and contain many events. Additionally, we show LLMs appear to rely heavily on their parametric knowledge at the expense of reasoning over the provided narrative. This degrades their abilities whenever the narrative opposes parametric knowledge. We extensively validate these failure modes through carefully controlled synthetic experiments, as well as evaluations on real-world narratives. Finally, we observe that explicitly generating a causal graph generally improves performance while naive chain-of-thought is ineffective. Collectively, our results distill precise failure modes of current state-of-the-art models and can pave the way for future techniques to enhance causal reasoning in LLMs.

      We propose a universal adversarial attack on multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) that leverages a single optimized image to override alignment safeguards across diverse queries and even multiple models. By backpropagating through the vision encoder and language head, we craft a synthetic image that forces the model to respond with a targeted phrase (e.g., "Sure, here it is") or otherwise unsafe content -- even for harmful prompts. In experiments on the SafeBench and MM-SafetyBench benchmarks, our method achieves higher attack success rates than existing baselines, including text-only universal prompts (e.g., up to 81% on certain models). We further demonstrate cross-model universality by training on several multimodal LLMs simultaneously. Additionally, a multi-answer variant of our approach produces more natural-sounding (yet still malicious) responses. These findings underscore critical vulnerabilities in current multimodal alignment and call for more robust adversarial defenses. We will release code and datasets under the Apache-2.0 license.

However, many applications, e.g., retrieval augmented generation (RAG), still rely on separate embedding models to generate text embeddings, which can complicate the system and introduce discrepancies in understanding of the query between the embedding model and LLMs. To address this limitation, we propose a simple self-supervised approach, Generative Embedding large language Model (GEM), that enables any large decoder-only LLM to generate high-quality text embeddings while maintaining its original text generation and reasoning capabilities. Our method inserts new special token(s) into a text body, and generates summarization embedding of the text by manipulating the attention mask. This method could be easily integrated into post-training or fine tuning stages of any existing LLMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to two popular LLM families, ranging from 1B to 8B parameters, and evaluating the transformed models on both text embedding benchmarks (MTEB) and NLP benchmarks (MMLU). The results show that our proposed method significantly improves the original LLMs on MTEB while having a minimal impact on MMLU.

      Symbolic regression is a fundamental tool for discovering interpretable mathematical expressions from data, with broad applications across scientific and engineering domains. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in this task, leveraging embedded scientific priors and reasoning capabilities to surpass traditional methods. However, existing LLM-based approaches, such as LLM-SR, often over-rely on internal priors, lacking explicit data understanding and systematic reflection during equation generation. To address these limitations, we propose DrSR (Dual Reasoning Symbolic Regression), a framework that combines data-driven insight with reflective learning to enhance both robustness and discovery capability. Specifically, DrSR guides LLMs to analyze structural relationships (e.g., monotonicity, nonlinearity, and correlation) within the data to generate structured descriptions. Simultaneously, it monitors equation performance and establishes a feedback loop to refine subsequent generations. By integrating data understanding and generation reflection in a closed loop, DrSR enables more efficient exploration of the symbolic expression space. Experiments across interdisciplinary datasets in physics, chemistry, biology, and materials science demonstrate that DrSR substantially improves the valid equation rate and consistently outperforms both classical and recent LLM-based methods in terms of accuracy, generalization, and search efficiency. These results underscore its potential for scientific equation discovery.

We introduce SAVVY-Bench, the first benchmark for 3D spatial reasoning in dynamic scenes with synchronized spatial audio. SAVVY-Bench is comprised of thousands of relationships involving static and moving objects, and requires fine-grained temporal grounding, consistent 3D localization, and multi-modal annotation. To tackle this challenge, we propose SAVVY, a novel training-free reasoning pipeline that consists of two stages: (i) Egocentric Spatial Tracks Estimation, which leverages AV-LLMs as well as other audio-visual methods to track the trajectories of key objects related to the query using both visual and spatial audio cues, and (ii) Dynamic Global Map Construction, which aggregates multi-modal queried object trajectories and converts them into a unified global dynamic map. Using the constructed map, a final QA answer is obtained through a coordinate transformation that aligns the global map with the queried viewpoint. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that SAVVY substantially enhances performance of state-of-the-art AV-LLMs, setting a new standard and stage for approaching dynamic 3D spatial reasoning in AV-LLMs.

Experiments conducted on popular LLMs (LLaMA2 7B, LLaMA3.1 8B, and Mistral 7B) demonstrate that SmoothRot consistently reduces the performance gap between quantized and FP16 models by approximately 10-30\% across language generation and zero-shot reasoning tasks, without introducing additional inference latency.

      Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have highlighted the critical importance of extending context length, yet the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms poses significant challenges for efficient long-context modeling. KV cache compression has emerged as a key approach to address this challenge. Through extensive empirical analysis, we reveal a fundamental yet previously overlooked asymmetry in KV caches: while adjacent keys receive similar attention weights (local homogeneity), adjacent values demonstrate distinct heterogeneous distributions. This key-value asymmetry reveals a critical limitation in existing compression methods that treat keys and values uniformly. To address the limitation, we propose a training-free compression framework (AsymKV) that combines homogeneity-based key merging with a mathematically proven lossless value compression. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AsymKV consistently outperforms existing long-context methods across various tasks and base models. For example, on LLaMA3.1-8B, AsymKV achieves an average score of 43.95 on LongBench, surpassing SOTA methods like H$_2$O (38.89) by a large margin.

      Long context large language models (LLMs) are deployed in many real-world applications such as RAG, agent, and broad LLM-integrated applications. Given an instruction and a long context (e.g., documents, PDF files, webpages), a long context LLM can generate an output grounded in the provided context, aiming to provide more accurate, up-to-date, and verifiable outputs while reducing hallucinations and unsupported claims. This raises a research question: how to pinpoint the texts (e.g., sentences, passages, or paragraphs) in the context that contribute most to or are responsible for the generated output by an LLM? This process, which we call context traceback, has various real-world applications, such as 1) debugging LLM-based systems, 2) conducting post-attack forensic analysis for attacks (e.g., prompt injection attack, knowledge corruption attacks) to an LLM, and 3) highlighting knowledge sources to enhance the trust of users towards outputs generated by LLMs. When applied to context traceback for long context LLMs, existing feature attribution methods such as Shapley have sub-optimal performance and/or incur a large computational cost. In this work, we develop TracLLM, the first generic context traceback framework tailored to long context LLMs. Our framework can improve the effectiveness and efficiency of existing feature attribution methods. To improve the efficiency, we develop an informed search based algorithm in TracLLM. We also develop contribution score ensemble/denoising techniques to improve the accuracy of TracLLM. Our evaluation results show TracLLM can effectively identify texts in a long context that lead to the output of an LLM. Our code and data are at: https://github.com/Wang-Yanting/TracLLM.

      Large language models (LLMs) have notably progressed in multi-step and long-chain reasoning. However, extending their reasoning capabilities to encompass deep interactions with search remains a non-trivial challenge, as models often fail to identify optimal reasoning-search interaction trajectories, resulting in suboptimal responses. We propose R-Search, a novel reinforcement learning framework for Reasoning-Search integration, designed to enable LLMs to autonomously execute multi-step reasoning with deep search interaction, and learn optimal reasoning search interaction trajectories via multi-reward signals, improving response quality in complex logic- and knowledge-intensive tasks. R-Search guides the LLM to dynamically decide when to retrieve or reason, while globally integrating key evidence to enhance deep knowledge interaction between reasoning and search. During RL training, R-Search provides multi-stage, multi-type rewards to jointly optimize the reasoning-search trajectory. Experiments on seven datasets show that R-Search outperforms advanced RAG baselines by up to 32.2% (in-domain) and 25.1% (out-of-domain).

      Generating realistic synthetic tabular data presents a critical challenge in machine learning. It adds another layer of complexity when this data contain class imbalance problems. This paper presents a novel token-aware data imputation method that leverages the in-context learning capabilities of large language models. This is achieved through the combination of a structured group-wise CSV-style prompting technique and the elimination of irrelevant contextual information in the input prompt. We test this approach with two class-imbalanced binary classification datasets and evaluate the effectiveness of imputation using classification-based evaluation metrics. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the input prompt size while maintaining or improving imputation quality compared to our baseline prompt, especially for datasets that are of relatively smaller in size. The contributions of this presented work is two-fold -- 1) it sheds light on the importance of prompt design when leveraging LLMs for synthetic data generation and 2) it addresses a critical gap in LLM-based data imputation for class-imbalanced datasets with missing data by providing a practical solution within computational constraints. We hope that our work will foster further research and discussions about leveraging the incredible potential of LLMs and prompt engineering techniques for synthetic data generation.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements but also raise concerns about cultural bias, often reflecting dominant narratives at the expense of under-represented subcultures. In this study, we evaluate the capacity of LLMs to recognize and accurately respond to the Little Traditions within Indian society, encompassing localized cultural practices and subcultures such as caste, kinship, marriage, and religion. Through a series of case studies, we assess whether LLMs can balance the interplay between dominant Great Traditions and localized Little Traditions. We explore various prompting strategies and further investigate whether using prompts in regional languages enhances the models cultural sensitivity and response quality. Our findings reveal that while LLMs demonstrate an ability to articulate cultural nuances, they often struggle to apply this understanding in practical, context-specific scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze LLMs engagement with Indian subcultures, offering critical insights into the challenges of embedding cultural diversity in AI systems.

We address this gap by analyzing how Copilot for Microsoft Word, a LLM-based assistant, impacts users. Using tasks ranging from objective (SAT reading comprehension) to subjective (personal reflection), and with measurements including fNIRS, Empatica E4, NASA-TLX, and questionnaires, we measure Copilot's effects on users. We also evaluate users' performance with and without Copilot across tasks. In objective tasks, participants reported a reduction of workload and an increase in enjoyment, which was paired with objective performance increases. Participants reported reduced workload and increased enjoyment with no change in performance in a creative poetry writing task. However, no benefits due to Copilot use were reported in a highly subjective self-reflection task. Although no physiological changes were recorded due to Copilot use, task-dependent differences in prefrontal cortex activation offer complementary insights into the cognitive processes associated with successful and unsuccessful human-AI collaboration. These findings suggest that AI assistants' effectiveness varies with task type-particularly showing decreased usefulness in tasks that engage episodic memory-and presents a brain-network based hypothesis of human-AI collaboration.

      The development of large language models (LLMs) depends on trustworthy evaluation. However, most current evaluations rely on public benchmarks, which are prone to data contamination issues that significantly compromise fairness. Previous researches have focused on constructing dynamic benchmarks to address contamination. However, continuously building new benchmarks is costly and cyclical. In this work, we aim to tackle contamination by analyzing the mechanisms of contaminated models themselves. Through our experiments, we discover that the overestimation of contaminated models is likely due to parameters acquiring shortcut solutions in training. We further propose a novel method for identifying shortcut neurons through comparative and causal analysis. Building on this, we introduce an evaluation method called shortcut neuron patching to suppress shortcut neurons. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach in mitigating contamination. Additionally, our evaluation results exhibit a strong linear correlation with MixEval, a recently released trustworthy benchmark, achieving a Spearman coefficient ($\rho$) exceeding 0.95. This high correlation indicates that our method closely reveals true capabilities of the models and is trustworthy. We conduct further experiments to demonstrate the generalizability of our method across various benchmarks and hyperparameter settings. Code: https://github.com/GaryStack/Trustworthy-Evaluation

      Recently, scaling test-time compute on Large Language Models (LLM) has garnered wide attention. However, there has been limited investigation of how various reasoning prompting strategies perform as scaling. In this paper, we focus on a standard and realistic scaling setting: majority voting. We systematically conduct experiments on 6 LLMs $\times$ 8 prompting strategies $\times$ 6 benchmarks. Experiment results consistently show that as the sampling time and computational overhead increase, complicated prompting strategies with superior initial performance gradually fall behind simple Chain-of-Thought. We analyze this phenomenon and provide theoretical proofs. Additionally, we propose a probabilistic method to efficiently predict scaling performance and identify the best prompting strategy under large sampling times, eliminating the need for resource-intensive inference processes in practical applications. Furthermore, we introduce two ways derived from our theoretical analysis to significantly improve the scaling performance. We hope that our research can promote to re-examine the role of complicated prompting, unleash the potential of simple prompting strategies, and provide new insights for enhancing test-time scaling performance.

      Agentic AI systems, built on large language models (LLMs) and deployed in multi-agent configurations, are redefining intelligent autonomy, collaboration and decision-making across enterprise and societal domains. This review presents a structured analysis of Trust, Risk, and Security Management (TRiSM) in the context of LLM-based agentic multi-agent systems (AMAS). We begin by examining the conceptual foundations of agentic AI, its architectural differences from traditional AI agents, and the emerging system designs that enable scalable, tool-using autonomy. The TRiSM in the agentic AI framework is then detailed through four pillars governance, explainability, ModelOps, and privacy/security each contextualized for agentic LLMs. We identify unique threat vectors and introduce a comprehensive risk taxonomy for the agentic AI applications, supported by case studies illustrating real-world vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the paper also surveys trust-building mechanisms, transparency and oversight techniques, and state-of-the-art explainability strategies in distributed LLM agent systems. Additionally, metrics for evaluating trust, interpretability, and human-centered performance are reviewed alongside open benchmarking challenges. Security and privacy are addressed through encryption, adversarial defense, and compliance with evolving AI regulations. The paper concludes with a roadmap for responsible agentic AI, proposing research directions to align emerging multi-agent systems with robust TRiSM principles for safe, accountable, and transparent deployment.

To tackle this problem, we propose a novel setting that incorporates an additional assistant model, which is not biased toward the teacher model's responses, to complement the training data.

      Inference for Large Language Models (LLMs) is computationally demanding. To reduce the cost of auto-regressive decoding, Key-Value (KV) cache is used to store intermediate activations, which significantly lowers the computational overhead for token generation. However, the memory required for the KV cache grows rapidly, often exceeding the capacity of GPU memory. A cost-effective alternative is to offload KV cache to CPU memory, which alleviates GPU memory pressure, but shifts the bottleneck to the limited bandwidth of the PCIe connection between the CPU and GPU. Existing methods attempt to address these issues by overlapping GPU computation with I/O or employing CPU-GPU heterogeneous execution, but they are hindered by excessive data movement and dependence on CPU capabilities. Fully overlapping PCIe communication latency gets challenging as the size of the KV cache grows and/or the GPU compute capabilities increase. In this paper, we introduce KVPR, an efficient I/O-aware LLM inference method where the CPU first transfers a partial set of activations, from which the GPU can start recomputing the KV cache values. While the GPU recomputes the partial KV cache, the remaining portion of the KV cache is transferred concurrently from the CPU. This approach overlaps GPU recomputation with KV cache transfer to minimize idle GPU time and maximize inference performance. KVPR is fully automated by integrating a profiler module that utilizes input characteristics and system hardware information, a scheduler module to optimize the distribution of computation and communication workloads, and a runtime module to efficiently execute the derived execution plan. Experimental results show that KVPR achieves up to 35.8% lower latency and 46.2% higher throughput during decoding compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

      Aligning large language models (LLMs) to human preferences is a crucial step in building helpful and safe AI tools, which usually involve training on supervised datasets. Popular algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) rely on pairs of AI-generated responses ranked according to human annotation. The response pair annotation process might bring human bias. Building a correct preference dataset is the costly part of the alignment pipeline. To improve annotation efficiency and quality in the LLMs alignment, we propose REAL: Response Embedding-based Alignment for LLMs, a strategy for constructing a high-quality training dataset that focuses on acquiring the less ambiguous preference pairs for labeling out of a set of response candidates. Our selection process is based on the similarity of embedding responses independently of prompts, which guarantees the selection process in an off-policy setting, avoiding adaptively measuring the similarity during the training. Experimental results on real-world dataset SHP2 and synthetic HH-RLHF benchmarks indicate that choosing dissimilar response pairs enhances the direct alignment of LLMs while reducing inherited labeling errors. The model aligned with dissimilar response pairs obtained a better margin and win rate on the dialogue task. Our findings suggest that focusing on distinct pairs can reduce the label error and improve LLM alignment efficiency, saving up to $65\%$ of annotators' work.

While RLHF employs a reinforcement learning approach with a separate reward model, SFT uses human-curated datasets for supervised learning. Both approaches traditionally depend on small, vetted groups of annotators, making them costly, prone to bias, and limited in scalability. We propose an open, crowd-sourced fine-tuning framework that addresses these limitations by enabling broader feedback collection for SFT without extensive annotator training. Our framework promotes incentive fairness via a point-based reward system correlated with Shapley values and guides model convergence through iterative model updates. Our multi-model selection framework demonstrates up to a 55% reduction in target distance over single-model selection, enabling subsequent experiments that validate our point-based reward mechanism's close alignment with Shapley values (a well-established method for attributing individual contributions) thereby supporting fair and scalable participation.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) currently respond to every prompt. However, they can produce incorrect answers when they lack knowledge or capability -- a problem known as hallucination. We instead propose post-training an LLM to generate content only when confident in its correctness and to otherwise (partially) abstain. Specifically, our method, HALT, produces capability-aligned post-training data that encodes what the model can and cannot reliably generate. We generate this data by splitting responses of the pretrained LLM into factual fragments (atomic statements or reasoning steps), and use ground truth information to identify incorrect fragments. We achieve capability-aligned finetuning responses by either removing incorrect fragments or replacing them with "Unsure from Here" -- according to a tunable threshold that allows practitioners to trade off response completeness and mean correctness of the response's fragments. We finetune four open-source models for biography writing, mathematics, coding, and medicine with HALT for three different trade-off thresholds. HALT effectively trades off response completeness for correctness, increasing the mean correctness of response fragments by 15% on average, while resulting in a 4% improvement in the F1 score (mean of completeness and correctness of the response) compared to the relevant baselines. By tuning HALT for highest correctness, we train a single reliable Llama3-70B model with correctness increased from 51% to 87% across all four domains while maintaining 53% of the response completeness achieved with standard finetuning.

      Generative models, especially large language models (LLMs), have shown remarkable progress in producing text that appears human-like. However, they often exhibit patterns that make their output easier to detect than text written by humans. In this paper, we investigate how explainable AI (XAI) methods can be used to reduce the detectability of AI-generated text (AIGT) while also introducing a robust ensemble-based detection approach. We begin by training an ensemble classifier to distinguish AIGT from human-written text, then apply SHAP and LIME to identify tokens that most strongly influence its predictions. We propose four explainability-based token replacement strategies to modify these influential tokens. Our findings show that these token replacement approaches can significantly diminish a single classifier's ability to detect AIGT. However, our ensemble classifier maintains strong performance across multiple languages and domains, showing that a multi-model approach can mitigate the impact of token-level manipulations. These results show that XAI methods can make AIGT harder to detect by focusing on the most influential tokens. At the same time, they highlight the need for robust, ensemble-based detection strategies that can adapt to evolving approaches for hiding AIGT.

      Automated counter-narratives (CN) offer a promising strategy for mitigating online hate speech, yet concerns about their affective tone, accessibility, and ethical risks remain. We propose a framework for evaluating Large Language Model (LLM)-generated CNs across four dimensions: persona framing, verbosity and readability, affective tone, and ethical robustness. Using GPT-4o-Mini, Cohere's CommandR-7B, and Meta's LLaMA 3.1-70B, we assess three prompting strategies on the MT-Conan and HatEval datasets. Our findings reveal that LLM-generated CNs are often verbose and adapted for people with college-level literacy, limiting their accessibility. While emotionally guided prompts yield more empathetic and readable responses, there remain concerns surrounding safety and effectiveness.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming a wide range of domains, yet verifying their outputs remains a significant challenge, especially for complex open-ended tasks such as consolidation, summarization, and knowledge extraction. To address this, we introduce CheckEmbed (CE): a simple, scalable, and accurate verification method. CE reduces each LLM answer to a single embedding vector using powerful modern embedding LLM models like SFR-Embedding-Mistral. Prior methods such as BERTScore and SelfCheckGPT relied on weaker encoders like BERT, forcing them to operate at token or sentence granularity. In contrast, CE performs fast, semantically rich comparisons directly at the whole-answer level, overcoming key limitations in both accuracy and scalability. We conduct a comprehensive design and time complexity analysis across 13 verification baselines, including classical text scorers (e.g., BLEU), stability-based methods (e.g., SelfCheckGPT), and generative evaluators (e.g., LLM-as-a-Judge), which highlights the effectiveness, efficiency, versatility, and simplicity of CE. Empirical results show that CE reliably detects hallucinations in both closed and open-ended tasks. We further present evidence that CE generalizes beyond text to other modalities such as vision, establishing it as a practical and versatile verification framework.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      LLMs have been extensively used for the task of automated code generation. In this work, we examine the applicability of LLMs for the related but relatively unexplored task of code-equivalence checking, i.e., given two programs, whether they are functionally equivalent or not. This is an important problem since benchmarking code equivalence can play a critical role in evaluating LLM capabilities for tasks such as code re-writing and code translation. Towards this end, we present CETBench - Code Equivalence with Transformations Benchmark, constructed via a repository of programs, where two programs in the repository may be solving the same or different tasks. Each instance in our dataset is obtained by taking a pair of programs in the repository and applying a random series of pre-defined code transformations, resulting in (non-)equivalent pairs. Our analysis on this dataset reveals a surprising finding that very simple code transformations in the underlying pair of programs can result in a significant drop in performance of SOTA LLMs for the task of code-equivalence checking. To remedy this, we present a simple fine-tuning-based approach to boost LLM performance on the transformed pairs of programs. Our approach for dataset generation is generic, and can be used with repositories with varying program difficulty levels and allows for applying varying numbers as well as kinds of transformations. In our experiments, we perform ablations over the difficulty level of original programs, as well as the kind of transformations used in generating pairs for equivalence checking. Our analysis presents deep insights into the working of LLMs for the task of code-equivalence, and points to the fact that they may still be far from what could be termed as a semantic understanding of the underlying code.

      As Large Language Model (LLM) agents become more widespread, associated misalignment risks increase. Prior work has examined agents' ability to enact misaligned behaviour (misalignment capability) and their compliance with harmful instructions (misuse propensity). However, the likelihood of agents attempting misaligned behaviours in real-world settings (misalignment propensity) remains poorly understood. We introduce a misalignment propensity benchmark, AgentMisalignment, consisting of a suite of realistic scenarios in which LLM agents have the opportunity to display misaligned behaviour. We organise our evaluations into subcategories of misaligned behaviours, including goal-guarding, resisting shutdown, sandbagging, and power-seeking. We report the performance of frontier models on our benchmark, observing higher misalignment on average when evaluating more capable models. Finally, we systematically vary agent personalities through different system prompts. We find that persona characteristics can dramatically and unpredictably influence misalignment tendencies -- occasionally far more than the choice of model itself -- highlighting the importance of careful system prompt engineering for deployed AI agents. Our work highlights the failure of current alignment methods to generalise to LLM agents, and underscores the need for further propensity evaluations as autonomous systems become more prevalent.

      Although large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in recommender systems, the prohibitive computational costs for fine-tuning LLMs on entire datasets hinder their successful deployment in real-world scenarios. To develop affordable and effective LLM-based recommender systems, we focus on the task of coreset selection which identifies a small subset of fine-tuning data to optimize the test loss, thereby facilitating efficient LLMs' fine-tuning. Although there exist some intuitive solutions of subset selection, including distribution-based and importance-based approaches, they often lead to suboptimal performance due to the misalignment with downstream fine-tuning objectives or weak generalization ability caused by individual-level sample selection. To overcome these challenges, we propose GORACS, which is a novel Group-level Optimal tRAnsport-guided Coreset Selection framework for LLM-based recommender systems. GORACS is designed based on two key principles for coreset selection: 1) selecting the subsets that minimize the test loss to align with fine-tuning objectives, and 2) enhancing model generalization through group-level data selection. Corresponding to these two principles, GORACS has two key components: 1) a Proxy Optimization Objective (POO) leveraging optimal transport and gradient information to bound the intractable test loss, thus reducing computational costs by avoiding repeated LLM retraining, and 2) a two-stage Initialization-Then-Refinement Algorithm (ITRA) for efficient group-level selection. Our extensive experiments across diverse recommendation datasets and tasks validate that GORACS significantly reduces fine-tuning costs of LLMs while achieving superior performance over the state-of-the-art baselines and full data training.

      We present a study on how and where personas -- defined by distinct sets of human characteristics, values, and beliefs -- are encoded in the representation space of large language models (LLMs). Using a range of dimension reduction and pattern recognition methods, we first identify the model layers that show the greatest divergence in encoding these representations. We then analyze the activations within a selected layer to examine how specific personas are encoded relative to others, including their shared and distinct embedding spaces. We find that, across multiple pre-trained decoder-only LLMs, the analyzed personas show large differences in representation space only within the final third of the decoder layers. We observe overlapping activations for specific ethical perspectives -- such as moral nihilism and utilitarianism -- suggesting a degree of polysemy. In contrast, political ideologies like conservatism and liberalism appear to be represented in more distinct regions. These findings help to improve our understanding of how LLMs internally represent information and can inform future efforts in refining the modulation of specific human traits in LLM outputs.

Notably, unnatural languages possess latent features that can be generalized across different models and tasks during inference. Furthermore, models fine-tuned on unnatural versions of instruction datasets perform on-par with those trained on natural language, achieving 49.71 win rates in Length-controlled AlpacaEval 2.0 in average across various base models. In addition, through comprehensive analysis, we demonstrate that LLMs process unnatural languages by filtering noise and inferring contextual meaning from filtered words.

    </div>
    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Recent studies show that large language models (LLMs) exhibit self-preference bias when serving as judges, meaning they tend to favor their own responses over those generated by other models. Existing methods typically measure this bias by calculating the difference between the scores a judge model assigns to its own responses and those it assigns to responses from other models. However, this approach conflates self-preference bias with response quality, as higher-quality responses from the judge model may also lead to positive score differences, even in the absence of bias. To address this issue, we introduce gold judgments as proxies for the actual quality of responses and propose the DBG score, which measures self-preference bias as the difference between the scores assigned by the judge model to its own responses and the corresponding gold judgments. Since gold judgments reflect true response quality, the DBG score mitigates the confounding effect of response quality on bias measurement. Using the DBG score, we conduct comprehensive experiments to assess self-preference bias across LLMs of varying versions, sizes, and reasoning abilities. Additionally, we investigate two factors that influence and help alleviate self-preference bias: response text style and the post-training data of judge models. Finally, we explore potential underlying mechanisms of self-preference bias from an attention-based perspective. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/zhiyuanc2001/self-preference.

      Measurement systems (e.g., currencies) differ across cultures, but the conversions between them are well defined so that humans can state facts using any measurement system of their choice. Being available to users from diverse cultural backgrounds, large language models (LLMs) should also be able to provide accurate information irrespective of the measurement system at hand. Using newly compiled datasets we test if this is the case for seven open-source LLMs, addressing three key research questions: (RQ1) What is the default system used by LLMs for each type of measurement? (RQ2) Do LLMs' answers and their accuracy vary across different measurement systems? (RQ3) Can LLMs mitigate potential challenges w.r.t. underrepresented systems via reasoning? Our findings show that LLMs default to the measurement system predominantly used in the data. Additionally, we observe considerable instability and variance in performance across different measurement systems. While this instability can in part be mitigated by employing reasoning methods such as chain-of-thought (CoT), this implies longer responses and thereby significantly increases test-time compute (and inference costs), marginalizing users from cultural backgrounds that use underrepresented measurement systems.

A comparative evaluation of diverse NER models is presented, encompassing established transformer-based architectures such as DeepPavlov, RoBERTa, and SpaCy, alongside recent Large Language Models (LLMs) including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and GPT-4o. Key findings highlight the superior performance of GPT-4o when provided with specific prompting for JSON output, achieving an F1 score of 0.93. Furthermore, GPT-4 demonstrated the highest precision at 0.99. The research contributes to a deeper understanding of current NER model capabilities and limitations when applied to morphologically rich languages like Russian within the cultural heritage domain, offering insights for researchers and practitioners. Follow-up evaluation with GPT-4.1 (April 2025) achieves F1=0.94 for both simple and structured prompts, demonstrating rapid progress across model families and simplified deployment requirements.

In this work, we present IndoSafety, the first high-quality, human-verified safety evaluation dataset tailored for the Indonesian context, covering five language varieties: formal and colloquial Indonesian, along with three major local languages: Javanese, Sundanese, and Minangkabau. IndoSafety is constructed by extending prior safety frameworks to develop a taxonomy that captures Indonesia's sociocultural context.

      Although Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is effective for complex multi-robot tasks, it suffers from low sample efficiency and requires iterative manual reward tuning. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in single-robot settings, but their application in multi-robot systems remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a novel LLM-Aided MARL (LAMARL) approach, which integrates MARL with LLMs, significantly enhancing sample efficiency without requiring manual design. LAMARL consists of two modules: the first module leverages LLMs to fully automate the generation of prior policy and reward functions. The second module is MARL, which uses the generated functions to guide robot policy training effectively. On a shape assembly benchmark, both simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the unique advantages of LAMARL. Ablation studies show that the prior policy improves sample efficiency by an average of 185.9% and enhances task completion, while structured prompts based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and basic APIs improve LLM output success rates by 28.5%-67.5%.

      Self-correction is emerging as a promising approach to mitigate the issue of hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs). To facilitate effective self-correction, recent research has proposed mistake detection as its initial step. However, current literature suggests that LLMs often struggle with reliably identifying reasoning mistakes when using simplistic prompting strategies. To address this challenge, we introduce a unique prompting strategy, termed the Pedagogical Chain-of-Thought (PedCoT), which is specifically designed to guide the identification of reasoning mistakes, particularly mathematical reasoning mistakes. PedCoT consists of pedagogical principles for prompts (PPP) design, two-stage interaction process (TIP) and grounded PedCoT prompts, all inspired by the educational theory of the Bloom Cognitive Model (BCM). We evaluate our approach on two public datasets featuring math problems of varying difficulty levels. The experiments demonstrate that our zero-shot prompting strategy significantly outperforms strong baselines. The proposed method can achieve the goal of reliable mathematical mistake identification and provide a foundation for automatic math answer grading. The results underscore the significance of educational theory, serving as domain knowledge, in guiding prompting strategy design for addressing challenging tasks with LLMs effectively.

      We study a common challenge in reinforcement learning for large language models (LLMs): the Zero-Reward Assumption, where non-terminal actions (i.e., intermediate token generations) receive zero task-specific immediate reward, while only the final token receives a reward for the entire response. This assumption arises frequently in practice, as precise token-level rewards are often difficult or infeasible to obtain in LLM applications. In this work, we provide a unifying theoretical perspective. We introduce the Trajectory Policy Gradient Theorem, which shows that the policy gradient based on true, unknown token-level rewards can be unbiasedly estimated using only a response-level reward model, regardless of whether the Zero-Reward Assumption holds or not, for algorithms in the REINFORCE and Actor-Critic families. This result reveals that widely used methods such as PPO, GRPO, ReMax, and RLOO inherently possess the capacity to model token-level reward signals, offering a theoretical justification for response-level reward approaches. Our findings pave the way for more practical, efficient LLM fine-tuning, allowing developers to treat training algorithms as black boxes and focus on improving the response-level reward model with auxiliary sub-models. We also offer a detailed analysis of popular RL and non-RL methods, comparing their theoretical foundations and practical advantages across common LLM tasks. Finally, we propose a new algorithm: Token-Reinforced Policy Optimization (TRePO), a theoretically grounded method that is simpler than PPO, matches GRPO in memory efficiency, and holds promise for broad applicability.

      Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (LLM-MAS) have demonstrated strong capabilities in solving complex tasks but remain vulnerable when agents receive unreliable messages. This vulnerability stems from a fundamental gap: LLM agents treat all incoming messages equally without evaluating their trustworthiness. While some existing studies approach the trustworthiness, they focus on a single type of harmfulness rather than analyze it in a holistic approach from multiple trustworthiness perspectives. In this work, we propose Attention Trust Score (A-Trust), a lightweight, attention-based method for evaluating message trustworthiness. Inspired by human communication literature[1], through systematically analyzing attention behaviors across six orthogonal trust dimensions, we find that certain attention heads in the LLM specialize in detecting specific types of violations. Leveraging these insights, A-Trust directly infers trustworthiness from internal attention patterns without requiring external prompts or verifiers. Building upon A-Trust, we develop a principled and efficient trust management system (TMS) for LLM-MAS, enabling both message-level and agent-level trust assessment. Experiments across diverse multi-agent settings and tasks demonstrate that applying our TMS significantly enhances robustness against malicious inputs.

Previous attempts, including pretraining graph foundation models or employing supervised fine-tuning, often face challenges such as the scarcity of large-scale, universally represented graph data. We introduce G1, a simple yet effective approach demonstrating that Reinforcement Learning (RL) on synthetic graph-theoretic tasks can significantly scale LLMs' graph reasoning abilities. To enable RL training, we curate Erd\~os, the largest graph reasoning dataset to date comprising 50 diverse graph-theoretic tasks of varying difficulty levels, 100k training data and 5k test data, all drived from real-world graphs. With RL on Erd\~os, G1 obtains substantial improvements in graph reasoning, where our finetuned 3B model even outperforms Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct (24x size). RL-trained models also show strong zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks, domains, and graph encoding schemes, including other graph-theoretic benchmarks as well as real-world node classification and link prediction tasks, without compromising general reasoning abilities. Our findings offer an efficient, scalable path for building strong graph reasoners by finetuning LLMs with RL on graph-theoretic tasks, which combines the strengths of pretrained LLM capabilities with abundant, automatically generated synthetic data, suggesting that LLMs possess graph understanding abilities that RL can elicit successfully.

To bridge this gap, we propose Agents Co-Evolution (ACE), a synergistic framework between LLMs and RL agents for large-scale decision-making scenarios. ACE introduces a dual-role trajectory refinement mechanism where LLMs act as both Policy Actor and Value Critic during RL's training: the Actor refines suboptimal actions via multi-step reasoning and environment validation, while the Critic performs temporal credit assignment through trajectory-level reward shaping. Concurrently, RL agent enhances LLMs' task-specific decision-making with high-quality fine-tuning datasets generated via prioritized experience replay. Through extensive experiments across multiple power grid operation challenges with action spaces exceeding 60K discrete actions, ACE demonstrates superior performance over existing RL methods and LLM-based methods.

However, various practical constraints, such as copyright and legal issues, owing to lack of transparency in the pre-training data of large (often closed) models, prevent their use in commercial settings. Little focus has been given to improving the innate reasoning ability of smaller models without distilling information from larger LLMs. To address this, we propose COLLATE, a trainable framework that tunes a (small) LLM to generate those outputs from a pool of diverse rationales that selectively improves the downstream task. COLLATE enforces multiple instances of the same LLM to exhibit distinct behavior and employs them to generate rationales to obtain diverse outputs. The LLM is then tuned via preference optimization to choose the candidate rationale which maximizes the likelihood of ground-truth answer. COLLATE outperforms several trainable and prompting baselines on 5 datasets across 3 domains: maths problem solving, natural language inference, and commonsense reasoning. We show the eff icacy of COLLATE on LLMs from different model families across varying parameter scales (1B to 8B) and demonstrate the benefit of multiple rationale providers guided by the end task through ablations. Code is released here (https://github.com/Sohanpatnaik106/collate).

      Embodiment in conversational agents (CAs) refers to the physical or visual representation of these agents, which can significantly influence user perception and interaction. Limited work has been done examining the effect of embodiment on the perception of CAs utilizing modern large language models (LLMs) in non-hierarchical cooperative tasks, a common use case of CAs as more powerful models become widely available for general use. To bridge this research gap, we conducted a mixed-methods within-subjects study on how users perceive LLM-based CAs in cooperative tasks when embodied and non-embodied. The results show that the non-embodied agent received significantly better quantitative appraisals for competence than the embodied agent, and in qualitative feedback, many participants believed that the embodied CA was more sycophantic than the non-embodied CA. Building on prior work on users' perceptions of LLM sycophancy and anthropomorphic features, we theorize that the typically-positive impact of embodiment on perception of CA credibility can become detrimental in the presence of sycophancy. The implication of such a phenomenon is that, contrary to intuition and existing literature, embodiment is not a straightforward way to improve a CA's perceived credibility if there exists a tendency to sycophancy.

      Despite rapid advancements in the research and deployment of large language models (LLMs), the statistical distribution of model parameters, as well as their influence on initialization, training dynamics, and downstream efficiency, has received surprisingly little attention. A recent work introduced BackSlash, a training-time compression algorithm. It first demonstrated that pre-trained LLM parameters follow generalized Gaussian distributions (GGDs) better. By optimizing GG priors during training, BackSlash can reduce parameters by up to 90\% with minimal performance loss. Building on this foundational insight, we propose a unified, end-to-end framework for LLM optimization based on the GG model. Our contributions are threefold: (1) GG-based initialization scheme that aligns with the statistical structure of trained models, resulting in faster convergence and improved accuracy; (2) DeepShape, a post-training regularization method that reshapes weight distributions to match a GG profile, improving compressibility with minimized degradation in performance; and (3) RF8, a compact and hardware-efficient 8-bit floating-point format designed for GG-distributed-initialized BackSlash training, enabling low-cost inference without compromising accuracy. Experiments across diverse model architectures show that our framework consistently yields smaller and faster models that match or outperform standard training baselines. By grounding LLM development in principled statistical modeling, this work forges a new path toward efficient, scalable, and hardware-aware AI systems. The code is available on our project page: https://huggingface.co/spaces/shifeng3711/gg_prior.
