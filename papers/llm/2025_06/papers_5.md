      Generative AI (genAI) technologies -- specifically, large language models (LLMs) -- and search have evolving relations. We argue for a novel perspective: using genAI to enrich a document corpus so as to improve query-based retrieval effectiveness. The enrichment is based on modifying existing documents or generating new ones. As an empirical proof of concept, we use LLMs to generate documents relevant to a topic which are more retrievable than existing ones. In addition, we demonstrate the potential merits of using corpus enrichment for retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and answer attribution in question answering.

      The OpenAI o1-series models have demonstrated that leveraging long-form Chain of Thought (CoT) can substantially enhance performance. However, the recursive thinking capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) remain limited, particularly in the absence of expert-curated data for distillation. In this paper, we propose \textbf{AvR}: \textbf{Alignment via Refinement}, a novel method aimed at unlocking the potential of LLMs for recursive reasoning through long-form CoT. AvR introduces a refinement process that integrates criticism and improvement actions, guided by differentiable learning techniques to optimize \textbf{refinement-aware rewards}. As a result, the synthesized multi-round data can be organized as a long refinement thought, further enabling test-time scaling. Experimental results show that AvR significantly outperforms conventional preference optimization methods. Notably, with only 3k synthetic samples, our method boosts the performance of the LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct model by over 20\% in win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0. Our code is available at Github (https://github.com/Banner-Z/AvR.git).

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming the landscape of digital content creation. However, the prevalent black-box Application Programming Interface (API) access to many LLMs introduces significant challenges in accountability, governance, and security. LLM fingerprinting, which aims to identify the source model by analyzing statistical and stylistic features of generated text, offers a potential solution. Current progress in this area is hindered by a lack of dedicated datasets and the need for efficient, practical methods that are robust against adversarial manipulations. To address these challenges, we introduce FD-Dataset, a comprehensive bilingual fingerprinting benchmark comprising 90,000 text samples from 20 famous proprietary and open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we present FDLLM, a novel fingerprinting method that leverages parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune a foundation model. This approach enables LoRA to extract deep, persistent features that characterize each source LLM. Through our analysis, we find that LoRA adaptation promotes the aggregation of outputs from the same LLM in representation space while enhancing the separation between different LLMs. This mechanism explains why LoRA proves particularly effective for LLM fingerprinting. Extensive empirical evaluations on FD-Dataset demonstrate FDLLM's superiority, achieving a Macro F1 score 22.1% higher than the strongest baseline. FDLLM also exhibits strong generalization to newly released models, achieving an average accuracy of 95% on unseen models. Notably, FDLLM remains consistently robust under various adversarial attacks, including polishing, translation, and synonym substitution. Experimental results show that FDLLM reduces the average attack success rate from 49.2% (LM-D) to 23.9%.

      Developing autonomous agents capable of performing complex, multi-step decision-making tasks specified in natural language remains a significant challenge, particularly in realistic settings where labeled data is scarce and real-time experimentation is impractical. Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches often struggle to generalize to unseen goals and states, limiting their applicability. In this paper, we introduce TEDUO, a novel training pipeline for offline language-conditioned policy learning in symbolic environments. Unlike conventional methods, TEDUO operates on readily available, unlabeled datasets and addresses the challenge of generalization to previously unseen goals and states. Our approach harnesses large language models (LLMs) in a dual capacity: first, as automatization tools augmenting offline datasets with richer annotations, and second, as generalizable instruction-following agents. Empirical results demonstrate that TEDUO achieves data-efficient learning of robust language-conditioned policies, accomplishing tasks beyond the reach of conventional RL frameworks or out-of-the-box LLMs alone.

      Modeling urban crime is an important yet challenging task that requires understanding the subtle visual, social, and cultural cues embedded in urban environments. Previous work has predominantly focused on rule-based agent-based modeling (ABM) and deep learning methods. ABMs offer interpretability of internal mechanisms but exhibit limited predictive accuracy.In contrast, deep learning methods are often effective in prediction but are less interpretable and require extensive training data. Moreover, both lines of work lack the cognitive flexibility to adapt to changing environments. Leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), we propose CrimeMind, a novel LLM-driven ABM framework for simulating urban crime within a multi-modal urban context.A key innovation of our design is the integration of the Routine Activity Theory (RAT) into the agentic workflow of CrimeMind, enabling it to process rich multi-modal urban features and reason about criminal behavior.However, RAT requires LLM agents to infer subtle cues in evaluating environmental safety as part of assessing guardianship, which can be challenging for LLMs. To address this, we collect a small-scale human-annotated dataset and align CrimeMind's perception with human judgment via a training-free textual gradient method.Experiments across four major U.S. cities demonstrate that CrimeMind outperforms both traditional ABMs and deep learning baselines in crime hotspot prediction and spatial distribution accuracy, achieving up to a 24% improvement over the strongest baseline.Furthermore, we conduct counterfactual simulations of external incidents and policy interventions and it successfully captures the expected changes in crime patterns, demonstrating its ability to reflect counterfactual scenarios.Overall, CrimeMind enables fine-grained modeling of individual behaviors and facilitates evaluation of real-world interventions.

      The LLM-as-a-judge paradigm uses large language models (LLMs) for automated text evaluation, where a numerical assessment is assigned by an LLM to the input text following scoring rubrics. Existing methods for LLM-as-a-judge use cross-entropy (CE) loss for fine-tuning, which neglects the numeric nature of score prediction. Recent work addresses numerical prediction limitations of LLM fine-tuning through regression-aware fine-tuning, which, however, does not consider chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for score prediction. In this paper, we introduce TRACT (Two-stage Regression-Aware fine-tuning with CoT), a method combining CoT reasoning with regression-aware training. TRACT consists of two stages: first, seed LLM is fine-tuned to generate CoTs, which serve as supervision for the second stage fine-tuning. The training objective of TRACT combines the CE loss for learning the CoT reasoning capabilities, and the regression-aware loss for the score prediction. Experiments across four LLM-as-a-judge datasets and two LLMs show that TRACT significantly outperforms existing methods. Extensive ablation studies validate the importance of each component in TRACT.

      Automated machine learning (AutoML) accelerates AI development by automating tasks in the development pipeline, such as optimal model search and hyperparameter tuning. Existing AutoML systems often require technical expertise to set up complex tools, which is in general time-consuming and requires a large amount of human effort. Therefore, recent works have started exploiting large language models (LLM) to lessen such burden and increase the usability of AutoML frameworks via a natural language interface, allowing non-expert users to build their data-driven solutions. These methods, however, are usually designed only for a particular process in the AI development pipeline and do not efficiently use the inherent capacity of the LLMs. This paper proposes AutoML-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework tailored for full-pipeline AutoML, i.e., from data retrieval to model deployment. AutoML-Agent takes user's task descriptions, facilitates collaboration between specialized LLM agents, and delivers deployment-ready models. Unlike existing work, instead of devising a single plan, we introduce a retrieval-augmented planning strategy to enhance exploration to search for more optimal plans. We also decompose each plan into sub-tasks (e.g., data preprocessing and neural network design) each of which is solved by a specialized agent we build via prompting executing in parallel, making the search process more efficient. Moreover, we propose a multi-stage verification to verify executed results and guide the code generation LLM in implementing successful solutions. Extensive experiments on seven downstream tasks using fourteen datasets show that AutoML-Agent achieves a higher success rate in automating the full AutoML process, yielding systems with good performance throughout the diverse domains.

      While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized as student-facing educational aids, their potential to directly support educators, particularly through locally deployable and customizable open-source solutions, remains significantly underexplored. Many existing educational solutions rely on cloud-based infrastructure or proprietary tools, which are costly and may raise privacy concerns. Regulated industries with limited budgets require affordable, self-hosted solutions. We introduce an end-to-end, open-source framework leveraging small (3B-7B parameters), locally deployed LLMs for customized teaching material generation and assessment. Our system uniquely incorporates an interactive loop crucial for effective small-model refinement, and an auxiliary LLM verifier to mitigate jailbreaking risks, enhancing output reliability and safety. Utilizing Retrieval and Context Augmented Generation (RAG/CAG), it produces factually accurate, customized pedagogically-styled content. Deployed on-premises for data privacy and validated through an evaluation pipeline and a college physics pilot, our findings show that carefully engineered small LLM systems can offer robust, affordable, practical, and safe educator support, achieving utility comparable to larger models for targeted tasks.

      Large Language Model (LLM) agents equipped with external tools have become increasingly powerful for complex tasks such as web shopping, automated email replies, and financial trading. However, these advancements amplify the risks of adversarial attacks, especially when agents can access sensitive external functionalities. Nevertheless, manipulating LLM agents into performing targeted malicious actions or invoking specific tools remains challenging, as these agents extensively reason or plan before executing final actions. In this work, we present UDora, a unified red teaming framework designed for LLM agents that dynamically hijacks the agent's reasoning processes to compel malicious behavior. Specifically, UDora first generates the model's reasoning trace for the given task, then automatically identifies optimal points within this trace to insert targeted perturbations. The resulting perturbed reasoning is then used as a surrogate response for optimization. By iteratively applying this process, the LLM agent will then be induced to undertake designated malicious actions or to invoke specific malicious tools. Our approach demonstrates superior effectiveness compared to existing methods across three LLM agent datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/AI-secure/UDora.

      The growing application of artificial intelligence in sensitive domains has intensified the demand for systems that are not only accurate but also explainable and trustworthy. Although explainable AI (XAI) methods have proliferated, many do not consider the diverse audiences that interact with AI systems: from developers and domain experts to end-users and society. This paper addresses how trust in AI is influenced by the design and delivery of explanations and proposes a multilevel framework that aligns explanations with the epistemic, contextual, and ethical expectations of different stakeholders. The framework consists of three layers: algorithmic and domain-based, human-centered, and social explainability. We highlight the emerging role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in enhancing the social layer by generating accessible, natural language explanations. Through illustrative case studies, we demonstrate how this approach facilitates technical fidelity, user engagement, and societal accountability, reframing XAI as a dynamic, trust-building process.

      Large language model (LLM) embeddings offer a promising new avenue for database query optimization. In this paper, we explore how pre-trained execution plan embeddings can guide SQL query execution without the need for additional model training. We introduce LLM-PM (LLM-based Plan Mapping), a framework that embeds the default execution plan of a query, finds its k nearest neighbors among previously executed plans, and recommends database hintsets based on neighborhood voting. A lightweight consistency check validates the selected hint, while a fallback mechanism searches the full hint space when needed. Evaluated on the JOB-CEB benchmark using OpenGauss, LLM-PM achieves an average speed-up of 21% query latency reduction. This work highlights the potential of LLM-powered embeddings to deliver practical improvements in query performance and opens new directions for training-free, embedding-based optimizer guidance systems.

      On-demand ride-hailing services like DiDi, Uber, and Lyft have transformed urban transportation, offering unmatched convenience and flexibility. In this paper, we introduce DiMA, an LLM-powered ride-hailing assistant deployed in DiDi Chuxing. Its goal is to provide seamless ride-hailing services and beyond through a natural and efficient conversational interface under dynamic and complex spatiotemporal urban contexts. To achieve this, we propose a spatiotemporal-aware order planning module that leverages external tools for precise spatiotemporal reasoning and progressive order planning. Additionally, we develop a cost-effective dialogue system that integrates multi-type dialog repliers with cost-aware LLM configurations to handle diverse conversation goals and trade-off response quality and latency. Furthermore, we introduce a continual fine-tuning scheme that utilizes real-world interactions and simulated dialogues to align the assistant's behavior with human preferred decision-making processes. Since its deployment in the DiDi application, DiMA has demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving 93% accuracy in order planning and 92% in response generation during real-world interactions. Offline experiments further validate DiMA capabilities, showing improvements of up to 70.23% in order planning and 321.27% in response generation compared to three state-of-the-art agent frameworks, while reducing latency by $0.72\times$ to $5.47\times$. These results establish DiMA as an effective, efficient, and intelligent mobile assistant for ride-hailing services.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on historical web data inevitably become outdated. We investigate evaluation strategies and update methods for LLMs as new data becomes available. We introduce a web-scale dataset for time-continual pretraining of LLMs derived from 114 dumps of Common Crawl (CC) - orders of magnitude larger than previous continual language modeling benchmarks. We also design time-stratified evaluations across both general CC data and specific domains (Wikipedia, StackExchange, and code documentation) to assess how well various continual learning methods adapt to new data while retaining past knowledge. Our findings demonstrate that, on general CC data, autoregressive meta-schedules combined with a fixed-ratio replay of older data can achieve comparable held-out loss to re-training from scratch, while requiring significantly less computation (2.6x). However, the optimal balance between incorporating new data and replaying old data differs as replay is crucial to avoid forgetting on generic web data but less so on specific domains.

      Detoxification, the task of rewriting harmful language into non-toxic text, has become increasingly important amid the growing prevalence of toxic content online. However, high-quality parallel datasets for detoxification, especially for hate speech, remain scarce due to the cost and sensitivity of human annotation. In this paper, we propose a novel LLM-in-the-loop pipeline leveraging GPT-4o-mini for automated detoxification. We first replicate the ParaDetox pipeline by replacing human annotators with an LLM and show that the LLM performs comparably to human annotation. Building on this, we construct ParaDeHate, a large-scale parallel dataset specifically for hatespeech detoxification. We release ParaDeHate as a benchmark of over 8K hate/non-hate text pairs and evaluate a wide range of baseline methods. Experimental results show that models such as BART, fine-tuned on ParaDeHate, achieve better performance in style accuracy, content preservation, and fluency, demonstrating the effectiveness of LLM-generated detoxification text as a scalable alternative to human annotation.

To address this, we introduce IDA-Bench, a novel benchmark evaluating LLM agents in multi-round interactive scenarios. Derived from complex Kaggle notebooks, tasks are presented as sequential natural language instructions by an LLM-simulated user. Agent performance is judged by comparing its final numerical output to the human-derived baseline. Initial results show that even state-of-the-art coding agents (like Claude-3.7-thinking) succeed on < 50% of the tasks, highlighting limitations not evident in single-turn tests.

      The scientific literature is growing rapidly, making it hard to keep track of the state-of-the-art. Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) aim to identify and evaluate all relevant papers on a topic. After retrieving a set of candidate papers, the abstract screening phase determines initial relevance. To date, abstract screening methods using large language models (LLMs) focus on binary classification settings; existing question answering (QA) based ranking approaches suffer from error propagation. LLMs offer a unique opportunity to evaluate the SLR's inclusion and exclusion criteria, yet, existing benchmarks do not provide them exhaustively. We manually extract these criteria as well as research questions for 57 SLRs, mostly in the medical domain, enabling principled comparisons between approaches. Moreover, we propose LGAR, a zero-shot LLM Guided Abstract Ranker composed of an LLM based graded relevance scorer and a dense re-ranker. Our extensive experiments show that LGAR outperforms existing QA-based methods by 5-10 pp. in mean average precision. Our code and data is publicly available.

      Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has shown great power in improving Large Language Models (LLMs). However, most existing RAG-based LLMs are dedicated to retrieving single modality information, mainly text; while for many real-world problems, such as healthcare, information relevant to queries can manifest in various modalities such as knowledge graph, text (clinical notes), and complex molecular structure. Thus, being able to retrieve relevant multi-modality domain-specific information, and reason and synthesize diverse knowledge to generate an accurate response is important. To address the gap, we present BioMol-MQA, a new question-answering (QA) dataset on polypharmacy, which is composed of two parts (i) a multimodal knowledge graph (KG) with text and molecular structure for information retrieval; and (ii) challenging questions that designed to test LLM capabilities in retrieving and reasoning over multimodal KG to answer questions. Our benchmarks indicate that existing LLMs struggle to answer these questions and do well only when given the necessary background data, signaling the necessity for strong RAG frameworks.

      While recent code-specific large language models (LLMs) have greatly enhanced their code generation capabilities, the safety of these models remains under-explored, posing potential risks as insecure code generated by these models may introduce vulnerabilities into real-world systems. Existing methods collect security-focused datasets from real-world vulnerabilities for instruction tuning in order to mitigate such issues. However, they are largely constrained by the data sparsity of vulnerable code, and have limited applicability in the multi-stage post-training workflows of modern LLMs. In this paper, we propose ProSec, a novel proactive security alignment approach designed to align code LLMs with secure coding practices. ProSec systematically exposes the vulnerabilities in a code LLM by synthesizing vulnerability-inducing coding scenarios from Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) and generates fixes to vulnerable code snippets, allowing the model to learn secure practices through preference learning objectives. The scenarios synthesized by ProSec trigger 25x more vulnerable code than a normal instruction-tuning dataset, resulting in a security-focused alignment dataset 7x larger than the previous work. Experiments show that models trained with ProSec are 25.2% to 35.4% more secure compared to previous work without degrading models' utility.

      Reward-model training is the cost bottleneck in modern Reinforcement Learning Human Feedback (RLHF) pipelines, often requiring tens of billions of parameters and an offline preference-tuning phase. In the proposed method, a frozen, instruction-tuned 7B LLM is augmented with only a one line JSON rubric and a rank-16 LoRA adapter (affecting just 0.8% of the model's parameters), enabling it to serve as a complete substitute for the previously used heavyweight evaluation models. The plug-and-play judge achieves 96.2% accuracy on RewardBench, outperforming specialized reward networks ranging from 27B to 70B parameters. Additionally, it allows a 7B actor to outperform the top 70B DPO baseline, which scores 61.8%, by achieving 92% exact match accuracy on GSM-8K utilizing online PPO. Thorough ablations indicate that (i) six in context demonstrations deliver the majority of the zero-to-few-shot improvements (+2pp), and (ii) the LoRA effectively addresses the remaining disparity, particularly in the safety and adversarial Chat-Hard segments. The proposed model introduces HH-Rationales, a subset of 10,000 pairs from Anthropic HH-RLHF, to examine interpretability, accompanied by human generated justifications. GPT-4 scoring indicates that our LoRA judge attains approximately = 9/10 in similarity to human explanations, while zero-shot judges score around =5/10. These results indicate that the combination of prompt engineering and tiny LoRA produces a cost effective, transparent, and easily adjustable reward function, removing the offline phase while achieving new state-of-the-art outcomes for both static evaluation and online RLHF.

      Temporal tabular question answering presents a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), requiring robust reasoning over structured data, which is a task where traditional prompting methods often fall short. These methods face challenges such as memorization, sensitivity to table size, and reduced performance on complex queries. To overcome these limitations, we introduce TempTabQA-C, a synthetic dataset designed for systematic and controlled evaluations, alongside a symbolic intermediate representation that transforms tables into database schemas. This structured approach allows LLMs to generate and execute SQL queries, enhancing generalization and mitigating biases. By incorporating adaptive few-shot prompting with contextually tailored examples, our method achieves superior robustness, scalability, and performance. Experimental results consistently highlight improvements across key challenges, setting a new benchmark for robust temporal reasoning with LLMs.

      LLM agents are widely used as agents for customer support, content generation, and code assistance. However, they are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, where adversarial inputs manipulate the model's behavior. Traditional defenses like input sanitization, guard models, and guardrails are either cumbersome or ineffective. In this paper, we propose a novel, lightweight defense mechanism called Polymorphic Prompt Assembling (PPA), which protects against prompt injection with near-zero overhead. The approach is based on the insight that prompt injection requires guessing and breaking the structure of the system prompt. By dynamically varying the structure of system prompts, PPA prevents attackers from predicting the prompt structure, thereby enhancing security without compromising performance. We conducted experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of PPA against existing attacks and compared it with other defense methods.

      Machine unlearning techniques aim to mitigate unintended memorization in large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches predominantly focus on the explicit removal of isolated facts, often overlooking latent inferential dependencies and the non-deterministic nature of knowledge within LLMs. Consequently, facts presumed forgotten may persist implicitly through correlated information. To address these challenges, we propose a knowledge unlearning evaluation framework that more accurately captures the implicit structure of real-world knowledge by representing relevant factual contexts as knowledge graphs with associated confidence scores. We further develop an inference-based evaluation protocol leveraging powerful LLMs as judges; these judges reason over the extracted knowledge subgraph to determine unlearning success. Our LLM judges utilize carefully designed prompts and are calibrated against human evaluations to ensure their trustworthiness and stability. Extensive experiments on our newly constructed benchmark demonstrate that our framework provides a more realistic and rigorous assessment of unlearning performance. Moreover, our findings reveal that current evaluation strategies tend to overestimate unlearning effectiveness.

      While understanding the knowledge boundaries of LLMs is crucial to prevent hallucination, research on the knowledge boundaries of LLMs has predominantly focused on English. In this work, we present the first study to analyze how LLMs recognize knowledge boundaries across different languages by probing their internal representations when processing known and unknown questions in multiple languages. Our empirical studies reveal three key findings: 1) LLMs' perceptions of knowledge boundaries are encoded in the middle to middle-upper layers across different languages. 2) Language differences in knowledge boundary perception follow a linear structure, which motivates our proposal of a training-free alignment method that effectively transfers knowledge boundary perception ability across languages, thereby helping reduce hallucination risk in low-resource languages; 3) Fine-tuning on bilingual question pair translation further enhances LLMs' recognition of knowledge boundaries across languages. Given the absence of standard testbeds for cross-lingual knowledge boundary analysis, we construct a multilingual evaluation suite comprising three representative types of knowledge boundary data.

      Developing algorithms to differentiate between machine-generated texts and human-written texts has garnered substantial attention in recent years. Existing methods in this direction typically concern an offline setting where a dataset containing a mix of real and machine-generated texts is given upfront, and the task is to determine whether each sample in the dataset is from a large language model (LLM) or a human. However, in many practical scenarios, sources such as news websites, social media accounts, and online forums publish content in a streaming fashion. Therefore, in this online scenario, how to quickly and accurately determine whether the source is an LLM with strong statistical guarantees is crucial for these media or platforms to function effectively and prevent the spread of misinformation and other potential misuse of LLMs. To tackle the problem of online detection, we develop an algorithm based on the techniques of sequential hypothesis testing by betting that not only builds upon and complements existing offline detection techniques but also enjoys statistical guarantees, which include a controlled false positive rate and the expected time to correctly identify a source as an LLM. Experiments were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

      Previous research has sought to enhance the graph reasoning capabilities of LLMs by supervised fine-tuning on synthetic graph data. While these led to specialized LLMs better at solving graph algorithm problems, we don't need LLMs for shortest path: we need generalization from synthetic graph data to real-world tasks with implicit graph structures. In this work, we propose to unlock generalizable learning of graph synthetic data with reinforcement learning. We first design solution-based and process-based rewards for synthetic graph problems: instead of rigid memorizing response patterns in direct fine-tuning, we posit that RL would help LLMs grasp the essentials underlying graph reasoning and alleviate overfitting. We employ RL algorithms such as GRPO and DPO, aligning both off-the-shelf LLMs and LLMs fine-tuned on synthetic graph data. We then compare them against existing settings on both in-domain synthetic tasks and out-of-domain real-world tasks with implicit graph structures such as multi-hop QA, structured planning, and more. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our RL recipe leads to statistically significant improvement on 5 datasets, with an average gain of 12.9\% over baseline settings. Further analysis reveals that process-based rewards consistently outperform solution-based rewards, mixing synthetic and real-world task data yields potential gains, while compositionality and explainable intermediate steps remains a critical challenge even after RL.

However, prior research has largely overlooked the security risks inherent in the generated code. In this work, we introduce \benchmark, a benchmark specifically designed to assess the security of LLM-generated code. The dataset encompasses a wide range of common software development scenarios and vulnerability types. Building upon this benchmark, we develop an automatic evaluation framework that leverages both static application security testing(SAST) and LLM-based judging to assess the presence of security vulnerabilities in model-generated code. Through the empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs on \benchmark, we reveal notable deficiencies in their ability to produce vulnerability-free code. Our findings highlight pressing challenges and offer actionable insights for future advancements in the secure code generation performance of LLMs. The data and code will be released soon.

      Long context large language models (LLMs) are deployed in many real-world applications such as RAG, agent, and broad LLM-integrated applications. Given an instruction and a long context (e.g., documents, PDF files, webpages), a long context LLM can generate an output grounded in the provided context, aiming to provide more accurate, up-to-date, and verifiable outputs while reducing hallucinations and unsupported claims. This raises a research question: how to pinpoint the texts (e.g., sentences, passages, or paragraphs) in the context that contribute most to or are responsible for the generated output by an LLM? This process, which we call context traceback, has various real-world applications, such as 1) debugging LLM-based systems, 2) conducting post-attack forensic analysis for attacks (e.g., prompt injection attack, knowledge corruption attacks) to an LLM, and 3) highlighting knowledge sources to enhance the trust of users towards outputs generated by LLMs. When applied to context traceback for long context LLMs, existing feature attribution methods such as Shapley have sub-optimal performance and/or incur a large computational cost. In this work, we develop TracLLM, the first generic context traceback framework tailored to long context LLMs. Our framework can improve the effectiveness and efficiency of existing feature attribution methods. To improve the efficiency, we develop an informed search based algorithm in TracLLM. We also develop contribution score ensemble/denoising techniques to improve the accuracy of TracLLM.

      The use of large language models (LLMs) for relevance assessment in information retrieval has gained significant attention, with recent studies suggesting that LLM-based judgments provide comparable evaluations to human judgments. Notably, based on TREC 2024 data, Upadhyay et al. make a bold claim that LLM-based relevance assessments, such as those generated by the UMBRELA system, can fully replace traditional human relevance assessments in TREC-style evaluations. This paper critically examines this claim, highlighting practical and theoretical limitations that undermine the validity of this conclusion. First, we question whether the evidence provided by Upadhyay et al. really supports their claim, particularly if a test collection is used asa benchmark for future improvements. Second, through a submission deliberately intended to do so, we demonstrate the ease with which automatic evaluation metrics can be subverted, showing that systems designed to exploit these evaluations can achieve artificially high scores. Theoretical challenges -- such as the inherent narcissism of LLMs, the risk of overfitting to LLM-based metrics, and the potential degradation of future LLM performance -- must be addressed before LLM-based relevance assessments can be considered a viable replacement for human judgments.

In this work, we adopt a mechanistic interpretability approach to analyze how such biases are structurally represented within models such as GPT-2 and Llama2. Focusing on demographic and gender biases, we explore different metrics to identify the internal edges responsible for biased behavior. We then assess the stability, localization, and generalizability of these components across dataset and linguistic variations. Through systematic ablations, we demonstrate that bias-related computations are highly localized, often concentrated in a small subset of layers. Moreover, the identified components change across fine-tuning settings, including those unrelated to bias. Finally, we show that removing these components not only reduces biased outputs but also affects other NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition and linguistic acceptability judgment because of the sharing of important components with these tasks.

      Recent advances in automatic speech recognition (ASR) have combined speech encoders with large language models (LLMs) through projection, forming Speech LLMs with strong performance. However, adapting them to new domains remains challenging, especially in low-resource settings where paired speech-text data is scarce. We propose a text-only fine-tuning strategy for Speech LLMs using unpaired target-domain text without requiring additional audio. To preserve speech-text alignment, we introduce a real-time evaluation mechanism during fine-tuning. This enables effective domain adaptation while maintaining source-domain performance. Experiments on LibriSpeech, SlideSpeech, and Medical datasets show that our method achieves competitive recognition performance, with minimal degradation compared to full audio-text fine-tuning. It also improves generalization to new domains without catastrophic forgetting, highlighting the potential of text-only fine-tuning for low-resource domain adaptation of ASR.

      As LLMs become central to interactive applications, ranging from tutoring to mental health, the ability to express personality in culturally appropriate ways is increasingly important. While recent works have explored personality evaluation of LLMs, they largely overlook the interplay between culture and personality. To address this, we introduce CulturalPersonas, the first large-scale benchmark with human validation for evaluating LLMs' personality expression in culturally grounded, behaviorally rich contexts. Our dataset spans 3,000 scenario-based questions across six diverse countries, designed to elicit personality through everyday scenarios rooted in local values. We evaluate three LLMs, using both multiple-choice and open-ended response formats. Our results show that CulturalPersonas improves alignment with country-specific human personality distributions (over a 20% reduction in Wasserstein distance across models and countries) and elicits more expressive, culturally coherent outputs compared to existing benchmarks. CulturalPersonas surfaces meaningful modulated trait outputs in response to culturally grounded prompts, offering new directions for aligning LLMs to global norms of behavior. By bridging personality expression and cultural nuance, we envision that CulturalPersonas will pave the way for more socially intelligent and globally adaptive LLMs.

      Recent advances in agentic LLMs have demonstrated great capabilities in Verilog code generation. However, existing approaches either use LLM-assisted single-agent prompting or cooperation-only multi-agent learning, which will lead to: (i) Degeneration issue for single-agent learning: characterized by diminished error detection and correction capabilities; (ii) Error propagation in cooperation-only multi-agent learning: erroneous information from the former agent will be propagated to the latter through prompts, which can make the latter agents generate buggy code. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based coopetitive multi-agent prompting framework, in which the agents cannot collaborate with each other to form the generation pipeline, but also create a healthy competitive mechanism to improve the generating quality. Our experimental results show that the coopetitive multi-agent framework can effectively mitigate the degeneration risk and reduce the error propagation while improving code error correction capabilities, resulting in higher quality Verilog code generation. The effectiveness of our approach is validated through extensive experiments. On VerilogEval Machine and Human dataset, CoopetitiveV+GPT-4 achieves 99.2% and 99.1% pass@10 scores, respectively.

      Hardware accelerators, especially those designed for tensor processing, have become ubiquitous in today's computing landscape. However, even with significant efforts in building compilers, programming these tensor accelerators remains challenging, leaving much of their potential underutilized. Recently, large language models (LLMs), trained on large amounts of code, have shown significant promise in code generation and optimization tasks, but generating low-resource languages like specialized tensor accelerator code still poses a significant challenge. We tackle this challenge with Autocomp, an approach that empowers accelerator programmers to leverage domain knowledge and hardware feedback to optimize code via an automated LLM-driven search. We accomplish this by: 1) formulating each optimization pass as a structured two-phase prompt, divided into planning and code generation phases, 2) inserting domain knowledge during planning via a concise and adaptable optimization menu, and 3) integrating correctness and performance metrics from hardware as feedback at each search iteration. Across three categories of representative workloads and two different accelerators, we demonstrate that Autocomp-optimized code runs 5.6x (GEMM) and 2.7x (convolution) faster than the vendor-provided library, and outperforms expert-level hand-tuned code by 1.4x (GEMM), 1.1x (convolution), and 1.3x (fine-grained linear algebra). Additionally, we demonstrate that optimization schedules generated from Autocomp can be reused across similar tensor operations, improving speedups by up to 24% under a fixed sample budget.

      This paper argues that a comprehensive vulnerability analysis is essential for building trustworthy Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (LLM-MAS). These systems, which consist of multiple LLM-powered agents working collaboratively, are increasingly deployed in high-stakes applications but face novel security threats due to their complex structures. While single-agent vulnerabilities are well-studied, LLM-MAS introduces unique attack surfaces through inter-agent communication, trust relationships, and tool integration that remain significantly underexplored. We present a systematic framework for vulnerability analysis of LLM-MAS that unifies diverse research. For each type of vulnerability, we define formal threat models grounded in practical attacker capabilities and illustrate them using real-world LLM-MAS applications. This formulation enables rigorous quantification of vulnerability across different architectures and provides a foundation for designing meaningful evaluation benchmarks. Our analysis reveals that LLM-MAS faces elevated risk due to compositional effects -- vulnerabilities in individual components can cascade through agent communication, creating threat models not present in single-agent systems. We conclude by identifying critical open challenges: (1) developing benchmarks specifically tailored to LLM-MAS vulnerability assessment, (2) considering new potential attacks specific to multi-agent architectures, and (3) implementing trust management systems that can enforce security in LLM-MAS. This research provides essential groundwork for future efforts to enhance LLM-MAS trustworthiness as these systems continue their expansion into critical applications.

      Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by enabling the retrieval of documents into the LLM context to provide more accurate and relevant responses. Existing RAG solutions do not focus on queries that may require fetching multiple documents with substantially different contents. Such queries occur frequently, but are challenging because the embeddings of these documents may be distant in the embedding space, making it hard to retrieve them all. This paper introduces Multi-Head RAG (MRAG), a novel scheme designed to address this gap with a simple yet powerful idea: leveraging activations of Transformer's multi-head attention layer, instead of the decoder layer, as keys for fetching multi-aspect documents. The driving observation is that different attention heads learn to capture different data aspects. Harnessing the corresponding activations results in embeddings that represent various facets of data items and queries, improving the retrieval accuracy for complex queries. We provide an evaluation methodology and metrics, multi-aspect datasets, and real-world use cases to demonstrate MRAG's effectiveness. We show MRAG's design advantages over 18 RAG baselines, empirical improvements of up to 20% in retrieval success ratios, and benefits for downstream LLM generation. MRAG can be seamlessly integrated with existing RAG frameworks and benchmarks.

      The rapid development of large-scale GPU clusters for LLM training has driven enterprises to replace core-layer electrical switches with optical circuit switches (OCS) to meet escalating bandwidth demands. However, current physical topology design of OCS-based clusters faces two critical challenges. First, there exist unrealizable logical topologies, leading to underutilization of bandwidth resource. Second, calculating OCS reconfiguration constitutes an NP-Complete problem and is time-consuming for multi-tenant GPU clusters which need real-time scheduling. In this paper, we propose \emph{Cross Wiring}, a new physical topology design that resolves both limitations. Our physical topology guarantees full compatibility with all logical topologies under L2-compatibility constraints. Through a proposed \emph{Symmetric Integer Matrix Decomposition Theorem}, we design a polynomial-time OCS reconfiguration algorithm that satisfies arbitrary logical topology requirements. Evaluations show a up to 39.5\% higher training throughput versus prior architectures such as \emph{Gemini} in 128-NPU testbed and a 12.6\% reduction in average job completion time through real-workload based multi-tenant large-scale simulations.

      Zero-shot Event Detection (ED), the task of identifying event mentions in natural language text without any training data, is critical for document understanding in specialized domains. Understanding the complex event ontology, extracting domain-specific triggers from the passage, and structuring them appropriately overloads and limits the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) for zero-shot ED. To this end, we propose DiCoRe, a divergent-convergent reasoning framework that decouples the task of ED using Dreamer and Grounder. Dreamer encourages divergent reasoning through open-ended event discovery, which helps to boost event coverage. Conversely, Grounder introduces convergent reasoning to align the free-form predictions with the task-specific instructions using finite-state machine guided constrained decoding. Additionally, an LLM-Judge verifies the final outputs to ensure high precision. Through extensive experiments on six datasets across five domains and nine LLMs, we demonstrate how DiCoRe consistently outperforms prior zero-shot, transfer-learning, and reasoning baselines, achieving 4-7% average F1 gains over the best baseline -- establishing DiCoRe as a strong zero-shot ED framework.

      Accurate and verifiable large language model (LLM) simulations of human research subjects promise an accessible data source for understanding human behavior and training new AI systems. However, results to date have been limited, and few social scientists have adopted this method. In this position paper, we argue that the promise of LLM social simulations can be achieved by addressing five tractable challenges. We ground our argument in a review of empirical comparisons between LLMs and human research subjects, commentaries on the topic, and related work. We identify promising directions, including context-rich prompting and fine-tuning with social science datasets. We believe that LLM social simulations can already be used for pilot and exploratory studies, and more widespread use may soon be possible with rapidly advancing LLM capabilities. Researchers should prioritize developing conceptual models and iterative evaluations to make the best use of new AI systems.

      The rise of general-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) systems, particularly large language models (LLMs), has raised pressing moral questions about how to reduce bias and ensure fairness at scale. Researchers have documented a sort of "bias" in the significant correlations between demographics (e.g., race, gender) in LLM prompts and responses, but it remains unclear how LLM fairness could be evaluated with more rigorous definitions, such as group fairness or fair representations. We analyze a variety of technical fairness frameworks and find inherent challenges in each that make the development of a fair LLM intractable. We show that each framework either does not logically extend to the general-purpose AI context or is infeasible in practice, primarily due to the large amounts of unstructured training data and the many potential combinations of human populations, use cases, and sensitive attributes. These inherent challenges would persist for general-purpose AI, including LLMs, even if empirical challenges, such as limited participatory input and limited measurement methods, were overcome. Nonetheless, fairness will remain an important type of model evaluation, and there are still promising research directions, particularly the development of standards for the responsibility of LLM developers, context-specific evaluations, and methods of iterative, participatory, and AI-assisted evaluation that could scale fairness across the diverse contexts of modern human-AI interaction.

      The assurance of mobile app GUI is more and more significant. Automated GUI testing approaches of different strategies have been developed, while there are still huge gaps between the approaches and the app business logic, not taking the completion of specific testing scenarios as the exploration target, leading to the exploration missing of critical app functionalities. Learning from the manual testing, which takes testing scenarios with app business logic as the basic granularity, in this paper, we utilize the LLMs to understand the semantics presented in app GUI and how they are mapped in the testing context based on specific testing scenarios. Then, scenario-based GUI tests are generated with the guidance of multi-agent collaboration. Specifically, we propose ScenGen, a novel LLM-guided scenario-based GUI testing approach involving five agents to respectively take responsibilities of different phases of the manual testing process. The Observer perceives the app GUI state by extracting GUI widgets and forming GUI layouts, understanding the expressed semantics. Then the app GUI info is sent to the Decider to make decisions on target widgets based on the target testing scenarios. The decision-making process takes the completion of specific testing scenarios as the exploration target. The Executor then executes the demanding operations on the apps. The execution results are checked by the Supervisor on whether the generated tests are consistent with the completion target of the testing scenarios, ensuring the traceability of the test generation and execution. Furthermore, the corresponding GUI test operations are recorded to the context memory by Recorder as an important basis for further decision-making, meanwhile monitoring the runtime bug occurrences. ScenGen is evaluated and the results show that ScenGen can effectively generate scenario-based GUI tests guided by LLMs.

      Mathematical optimization is fundamental to decision-making across diverse domains, from operations research to healthcare. Yet, translating real-world problems into optimization models remains a difficult task, often demanding specialized expertise. This paper approaches the problem of $\textit{autoformulation}$: the automated creation of solver-ready optimization models from natural language problem descriptions. We identify three core challenges of autoformulation: $\textit{(1)}$ the vast, problem-dependent hypothesis space, $\textit{(2)}$ efficient and diverse exploration of this space under uncertainty, and $\textit{(3)}$ evaluation of formulation correctness against problem description. To address these challenges, we present a novel method leveraging $\textit{Large Language Models}$ (LLMs) with $\textit{Monte-Carlo Tree Search}$, exploiting the hierarchical nature of optimization modeling to generate and systematically explore possible formulations. To enhance search efficiency, we introduce symbolic pruning to eliminate trivially equivalent search paths (branches), and employ LLM-based evaluation of partial formulations to guide search. Empirical analysis on linear and mixed-integer programming benchmarks demonstrates our method's effectiveness, with significant performance gains from both LLM-based value estimation and symbolic pruning techniques.

      Self-harm detection on social media is critical for early intervention and mental health support, yet remains challenging due to the subtle, context-dependent nature of such expressions. Identifying self-harm intent aids suicide prevention by enabling timely responses, but current large language models (LLMs) struggle to interpret implicit cues in casual language and emojis. This work enhances LLMs' comprehension of self-harm by distinguishing intent through nuanced language-emoji interplay. We present the Centennial Emoji Sensitivity Matrix (CESM-100), a curated set of 100 emojis with contextual self-harm interpretations and the Self-Harm Identification aNd intent Extraction with Supportive emoji sensitivity (SHINES) dataset, offering detailed annotations for self-harm labels, casual mentions (CMs), and serious intents (SIs). Our unified framework: a) enriches inputs using CESM-100; b) fine-tunes LLMs for multi-task learning: self-harm detection (primary) and CM/SI span detection (auxiliary); c) generates explainable rationales for self-harm predictions. We evaluate the framework on three state-of-the-art LLMs-Llama 3, Mental-Alpaca, and MentalLlama, across zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned scenarios. By coupling intent differentiation with contextual cues, our approach commendably enhances LLM performance in both detection and explanation tasks, effectively addressing the inherent ambiguity in self-harm signals.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) perform exceedingly well in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks for many languages including English. However, despite being the fifth most-spoken language globally, Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) in Bangla remains underdeveloped. In this work, we investigate how LLMs can be leveraged for improving Bangla GEC. For that, we first do an extensive categorization of 12 error classes in Bangla, and take a survey of native Bangla speakers to collect real-world errors. We next devise a rule-based noise injection method to create grammatically incorrect sentences corresponding to correct ones. The Vaiyakarana dataset, thus created, consists of 5,67,422 sentences of which 2,27,119 are erroneous. This dataset is then used to instruction-tune LLMs for the task of GEC in Bangla. Evaluations show that instruction-tuning with \name improves GEC performance of LLMs by 3-7 percentage points as compared to the zero-shot setting, and makes them achieve human-like performance in grammatical error identification. Humans, though, remain superior in error correction.

      Driven by advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), integrating them into recommendation tasks has gained interest due to their strong semantic understanding and prompt flexibility. Prior work encoded user-item interactions or metadata into prompts for recommendations. In parallel, LLM reasoning, boosted by test-time scaling and reinforcement learning, has excelled in fields like mathematics and code, where reasoning traces and correctness signals are clear, enabling high performance and interpretability. However, directly applying these reasoning methods to recommendation is ineffective because user feedback is implicit and lacks reasoning supervision. To address this, we propose $\textbf{R2Rec}$, a reasoning-enhanced recommendation framework that samples interaction chains from the user-item graph and converts them into structured interaction-of-thoughts via a progressive masked prompting strategy, with each thought representing stepwise reasoning grounded in interaction context. This allows LLMs to simulate step-by-step decision-making based on implicit patterns. We design a two-stage training pipeline: supervised fine-tuning teaches basic reasoning from high-quality traces, and reinforcement learning refines reasoning via reward signals, alleviating sparse explicit supervision. Experiments on three real-world datasets show R2Rec outperforms classical and LLM-based baselines with an average $\textbf{10.48%}$ improvement in HitRatio@1 and $\textbf{131.81%}$ gain over the original LLM. Furthermore, the explicit reasoning chains enhance interpretability by revealing the decision process. Our code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/R2Rec-7C5D.

Yet, cross-domain collaboration shatters the unified trust assumptions behind current alignment and containment techniques. An agent benign in isolation may, when receiving messages from an untrusted peer, leak secrets or violate policy, producing risks driven by emergent multi-agent dynamics rather than classical software bugs. This position paper maps the security agenda for cross-domain multi-agent LLM systems. We introduce seven categories of novel security challenges, for each of which we also present plausible attacks, security evaluation metrics, and future research guidelines.

Evaluating debate speeches requires a deep understanding of the speech at multiple levels, including argument strength and relevance, the coherence and organization of the speech, the appropriateness of its style and tone, and so on. This task involves a unique set of cognitive abilities that have previously received limited attention in systematic LLM benchmarking. To explore such skills, we leverage a dataset of over 600 meticulously annotated debate speeches and present the first in-depth analysis of how state-of-the-art LLMs compare to human judges on this task. Our findings reveal a nuanced picture: while larger models can approximate individual human judgments in some respects, they differ substantially in their overall judgment behavior. We also investigate the ability of frontier LLMs to generate persuasive, opinionated speeches, showing that models may perform at a human level on this task.

      Large language models (LLMs) have achieved distinguished performance on various reasoning-intensive tasks. However, LLMs might still face the challenges of robustness issues and fail unexpectedly in some simple reasoning tasks. Previous works evaluate the LLM robustness with hand-crafted templates or a limited set of perturbation rules, indicating potential data contamination in pre-training or fine-tuning datasets. In this work, inspired by stress testing in software engineering, we propose a novel framework, Automatic Robustness Checker (AR-Checker), to generate mathematical problem variants that maintain the semantic meanings of the original one but might fail the LLMs. The AR-Checker framework generates mathematical problem variants through multi-round parallel streams of LLM-based rewriting and verification. Our framework can generate benchmark variants dynamically for each LLM, thus minimizing the risk of data contamination. Experiments on GSM8K and MATH-500 demonstrate the strong performance of AR-Checker on mathematical tasks. We also evaluate AR-Checker on benchmarks beyond mathematics, including MMLU, MMLU-Pro, and CommonsenseQA, where it also achieves strong performance, further proving the effectiveness of AR-Checker.

It motivates this paper to explore enhanced unlearning schemes that can mitigate this trade-off. Specifically, we propose Gradient Rectified Unlearning (GRU), an improved framework that regulates the directions of gradient updates during the unlearning procedure such that their side impacts on other, unrelated responses can be minimized. GRU is easy and general to implement, demonstrating practical effectiveness across a variety of well-established unlearning benchmarks.

      System prompts in Large Language Models (LLMs) are predefined directives that guide model behaviour, taking precedence over user inputs in text processing and generation. LLM deployers increasingly use them to ensure consistent responses across contexts. While model providers set a foundation of system prompts, deployers and third-party developers can append additional prompts without visibility into others' additions, while this layered implementation remains entirely hidden from end-users. As system prompts become more complex, they can directly or indirectly introduce unaccounted for side effects. This lack of transparency raises fundamental questions about how the position of information in different directives shapes model outputs. As such, this work examines how the placement of information affects model behaviour. To this end, we compare how models process demographic information in system versus user prompts across six commercially available LLMs and 50 demographic groups. Our analysis reveals significant biases, manifesting in differences in user representation and decision-making scenarios. Since these variations stem from inaccessible and opaque system-level configurations, they risk representational, allocative and potential other biases and downstream harms beyond the user's ability to detect or correct. Our findings draw attention to these critical issues, which have the potential to perpetuate harms if left unexamined. Further, we argue that system prompt analysis must be incorporated into AI auditing processes, particularly as customisable system prompts become increasingly prevalent in commercial AI deployments.

      Large language models (LLMs) require substantial compute, and thus energy, at inference time. While quantizing weights and activations is effective at improving efficiency, naive quantization of LLMs can significantly degrade performance due to large magnitude outliers. This paper describes FPTQuant, which introduces four novel, lightweight, and expressive function-preserving transforms (FPTs) to facilitate quantization of transformers: (1) a mergeable pre-RoPE transform for queries and keys, (2) a mergeable transform for values, (3) a mergeable scaling transform within the MLP block, and (4) a cheap, dynamic scaling transform. By leveraging the equivariances and independencies inherent to canonical transformer operation, we designed these FPTs to maintain the model's function while shaping the intermediate activation distributions to be more quantization friendly. FPTQuant requires no custom kernels and adds virtually no overhead during inference. The FPTs are trained both locally to reduce outliers, and end-to-end such that the outputs of the quantized and full-precision models match. FPTQuant enables static INT4 quantization with minimal overhead and shows SOTA speed-up of up to 3.9 times over FP. Empirically, FPTQuant has an excellent accuracy-speed trade-off -- it is performing on par or exceeding most prior work and only shows slightly lower accuracy compared to a method that is up to 29% slower.

      We introduce EvaLearn, a pioneering benchmark designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their learning capability and efficiency in challenging tasks, a critical, yet underexplored aspect of model potential. EvaLearn contains 648 challenging problems across six task types, grouped into 182 sequences, each sequence dedicated to one task type. Diverging from most existing benchmarks that evaluate models in parallel, EvaLearn requires models to solve problems sequentially, allowing them to leverage the experience gained from previous solutions. EvaLearn provides five comprehensive automated metrics to evaluate models and quantify their learning capability and efficiency. We extensively benchmark nine frontier models and observe varied performance profiles: some models, such as Claude-3.7-sonnet, start with moderate initial performance but exhibit strong learning ability, while some models struggle to benefit from experience and may even show negative transfer. Moreover, we investigate model performance under two learning settings and find that instance-level rubrics and teacher-model feedback further facilitate model learning. Importantly, we observe that current LLMs with stronger static abilities do not show a clear advantage in learning capability across all tasks, highlighting that EvaLearn evaluates a new dimension of model performance. We hope EvaLearn provides a novel evaluation perspective for assessing LLM potential and understanding the gap between models and human capabilities, promoting the development of deeper and more dynamic evaluation approaches.

We review current evaluation metrics for both GUI and general LLM agents and outline five key challenges in integrating human evaluators for GUI agent assessments. To address these gaps, we advocate for a human-centered evaluation framework that incorporates risk assessments, enhances user awareness through in-context consent, and embeds privacy and security considerations into GUI agent design and evaluation.

Specifically, we investigate LLMs as spatial reasoners to overcome these limitations by uniformly encoding environments (e.g., real indoor floorplans), agents which can be dynamic obstacles and their paths as discrete tokens akin to language tokens. Our training-free framework supports multi-agent coordination, closed-loop replanning, and dynamic obstacle avoidance without retraining or fine-tuning. We show that LLMs can generalize across agents, tasks, and environments using only text-based interactions, opening new possibilities for semantically grounded, interactive navigation in both simulation and embodied systems.

      Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to generate formative feedback and instructional hints in English, making them increasingly relevant for AI-assisted education. However, their ability to provide effective instructional support across different languages, especially for mathematically grounded reasoning tasks, remains largely unexamined. In this work, we present the first large-scale simulation of multilingual tutor-student interactions using LLMs. A stronger model plays the role of the tutor, generating feedback in the form of hints, while a weaker model simulates the student. We explore 352 experimental settings across 11 typologically diverse languages, four state-of-the-art LLMs, and multiple prompting strategies to assess whether language-specific feedback leads to measurable learning gains. Our study examines how student input language, teacher feedback language, model choice, and language resource level jointly influence performance. Results show that multilingual hints can significantly improve learning outcomes, particularly in low-resource languages when feedback is aligned with the student's native language. These findings offer practical insights for developing multilingual, LLM-based educational tools that are both effective and inclusive.

      The honesty of large language models (LLMs) is a critical alignment challenge, especially as advanced systems with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning may strategically deceive humans. Unlike traditional honesty issues on LLMs, which could be possibly explained as some kind of hallucination, those models' explicit thought paths enable us to study strategic deception--goal-driven, intentional misinformation where reasoning contradicts outputs. Using representation engineering, we systematically induce, detect, and control such deception in CoT-enabled LLMs, extracting "deception vectors" via Linear Artificial Tomography (LAT) for 89% detection accuracy. Through activation steering, we achieve a 40% success rate in eliciting context-appropriate deception without explicit prompts, unveiling the specific honesty-related issue of reasoning models and providing tools for trustworthy AI alignment.

      Large Language Models (LLMs), whilst great at extracting facts from text, struggle with nested narrative reasoning. Existing long context and multi-hop QA benchmarks inadequately test this, lacking realistic distractors or failing to decouple context length from reasoning complexity, masking a fundamental LLM limitation. We introduce Verbose ListOps, a novel benchmark that programmatically transposes ListOps computations into lengthy, coherent stories. This uniquely forces internal computation and state management of nested reasoning problems by withholding intermediate results, and offers fine-grained controls for both narrative size \emph{and} reasoning difficulty. Whilst benchmarks like LongReason (2025) advance approaches for synthetically expanding the context size of multi-hop QA problems, Verbose ListOps pinpoints a specific LLM vulnerability: difficulty in state management for nested sub-reasoning amongst semantically-relevant, distracting narrative. Our experiments show that leading LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o4, Gemini 2.5 Pro) collapse in performance on Verbose ListOps at modest (~10k token) narrative lengths, despite effortlessly solving raw ListOps equations. Addressing this failure is paramount for real-world text interpretation which requires identifying key reasoning points, tracking conceptual intermediate results, and filtering irrelevant information. Verbose ListOps, and its extensible generation framework thus enables targeted reasoning enhancements beyond mere context-window expansion; a critical step to automating the world's knowledge work.

      With the significant progress of large reasoning models in complex coding and reasoning tasks, existing benchmarks, like LiveCodeBench and CodeElo, are insufficient to evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in real competition environments. Moreover, current evaluation metrics such as Pass@K fail to capture the reflective abilities of reasoning models. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{ICPC-Eval}, a top-level competitive coding benchmark designed to probing the frontiers of LLM reasoning. ICPC-Eval includes 118 carefully curated problems from 11 recent ICPC contests held in various regions of the world, offering three key contributions: 1) A challenging realistic ICPC competition scenario, featuring a problem type and difficulty distribution consistent with actual contests. 2) A robust test case generation method and a corresponding local evaluation toolkit, enabling efficient and accurate local evaluation. 3) An effective test-time scaling evaluation metric, Refine@K, which allows iterative repair of solutions based on execution feedback. The results underscore the significant challenge in evaluating complex reasoning abilities: top-tier reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 often rely on multi-turn code feedback to fully unlock their in-context reasoning potential when compared to non-reasoning counterparts. Furthermore, despite recent advancements in code generation, these models still lag behind top-performing human teams. We release the benchmark at: https://github.com/RUCAIBox/Slow_Thinking_with_LLMs

      Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant success in reasoning tasks, including mathematical reasoning and logical deduction. Among these reasoning tasks, graph problems stand out due to their complexity and unique structural characteristics, attracting considerable attention from researchers. Previous studies have explored LLMs' graph reasoning abilities through various techniques, such as different encoding methods for graph structures and the use of carefully designed prompts. However, a critical factor has been mostly overlooked: the prompt sequential order in which graph descriptions are presented to the models. In this study, we present the first comprehensive analysis of how the order of graph descriptions impacts LLM performance. Specifically, we comprehensively evaluate four graph description orders across six graph problems using six mainstream LLMs. The results reveal that: (1) ordered graph descriptions significantly improve LLMs' comprehension of graph structures; (2) the robustness of LLMs to graph description order varies across different tasks; and (3) the impact of graph order on performance is closely related to the inherent characteristics of tasks. This study provides a critical advancement in the application of LLMs for solving graph-related problems, paving the way for future research to optimize model performance through strategic graph description ordering.

      Recent work suggests that large language models (LLMs) can improve performance of speech tasks compared to existing systems. To support their claims, results on LibriSpeech and Common Voice are often quoted. However, this work finds that a substantial amount of the LibriSpeech and Common Voice evaluation sets appear in public LLM pretraining corpora. This calls into question the reliability of findings drawn from these two datasets. To measure contamination impact, LLMs trained with/without contamination are compared. A contaminated LLM is more likely to generate test sentences it has seen during training. Then, speech recognisers based on LLMs are compared. They show only subtle error rate differences if the LLM is contaminated, but assign significantly higher probabilities to transcriptions seen during LLM training. Results show that LLM outputs can be biased by tiny amounts of data contamination, highlighting the importance of evaluating LLM-based speech systems with held-out data.

      We propose a method that enables large language models (LLMs) to control embodied agents by directly mapping continuous observation vectors to continuous action vectors. Initially, the LLMs generate a control strategy based on a textual description of the agent, its environment, and the intended goal. This strategy is then iteratively refined through a learning process in which the LLMs are repeatedly prompted to improve the current strategy, using performance feedback and sensory-motor data collected during its evaluation. The method is validated on classic control tasks from the Gymnasium library and the inverted pendulum task from the MuJoCo library. In most cases, it successfully identifies optimal or high-performing solutions by integrating symbolic knowledge derived through reasoning with sub-symbolic sensory-motor data gathered as the agent interacts with its environment.

Using eight open-source large language models (LLMs) of varying sizes, we investigate how different prompting strategies, varying numbers of few-shot examples, and demonstration selection influence translation quality and length control. We discover that the phrasing of instructions, when aligned with the properties of the provided demonstrations, plays a crucial role in controlling the output length. Our experiments show that LLMs tend to produce shorter translations only when presented with extreme examples, while isometric demonstrations often lead to the models disregarding length constraints. While few-shot prompting generally enhances translation quality, further improvements are marginal across 5, 10, and 20-shot settings. Finally, considering multiple outputs allows to notably improve overall tradeoff between the length and quality, yielding state-of-the-art performance for some language pairs.

Current approaches focus on integrating protein-related knowledge into large language models through continued pretraining and multi-modal alignment, enabling simultaneous comprehension of textual descriptions and protein sequences. Through a thorough analysis of existing model architectures and text-based protein understanding benchmarks, we identify significant data leakage issues present in current benchmarks. Moreover, conventional metrics derived from natural language processing fail to accurately assess the model's performance in this domain. To address these limitations, we reorganize existing datasets and introduce a novel evaluation framework based on biological entities.

In this paper, we present a framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) for automating attack mitigation policy compliance through an innovative combination of in-context learning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We begin by describing how our system collects and manages both tool and API specifications, storing them in a vector database to enable efficient retrieval of relevant information. We then detail the architectural pipeline that first decomposes high-level mitigation policies into discrete tasks and subsequently translates each task into a set of actionable API calls. Our empirical evaluation, conducted using publicly available CTI policies in STIXv2 format and Windows API documentation, demonstrates significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score when employing RAG compared to a non-RAG baseline.

      Large language models (LLMs) excel at many supervised tasks but often struggle with structured reasoning in unfamiliar settings. This discrepancy suggests that standard fine-tuning pipelines may instill narrow, domain-specific heuristics rather than fostering general-purpose thinking strategies. In this work, we propose a "play to learn" framework that fine-tunes LLMs through reinforcement learning on a suite of seven custom logic puzzles, each designed to cultivate distinct reasoning skills such as constraint propagation, spatial consistency, and symbolic deduction. Using a reinforcement learning setup with verifiable rewards, models receive binary feedback based on puzzle correctness, encouraging iterative, hypothesis-driven problem solving. We demonstrate that this training approach significantly improves out-of-distribution performance on a range of mathematical benchmarks, especially for mid-difficulty problems that require multi-step reasoning. Analyses across problem categories and difficulty levels reveal that puzzle training promotes transferable reasoning routines, strengthening algebraic manipulation, geometric inference, and combinatorial logic, while offering limited gains on rote or highly specialized tasks. These findings show that reinforcement learning over logic puzzles reshapes the internal reasoning of LLMs, enabling more robust and compositional generalization without relying on task-specific symbolic tools.

      Logical reasoning is a core capability for many applications of large language models (LLMs), yet existing benchmarks often rely solely on final-answer accuracy, failing to capture the quality and structure of the reasoning process. We propose FineLogic, a fine-grained evaluation framework that assesses logical reasoning across three dimensions: overall benchmark accuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level alignment. In addition, to better understand how reasoning capabilities emerge, we conduct a comprehensive study on the effects of supervision format during fine-tuning. We construct four supervision styles (one natural language and three symbolic variants) and train LLMs under each. Our findings reveal that natural language supervision yields strong generalization even on out-of-distribution and long-context tasks, while symbolic reasoning styles promote more structurally sound and atomic inference chains. Further, our representation-level probing shows that fine-tuning primarily improves reasoning behaviors through step-by-step generation, rather than enhancing shortcut prediction or internalized correctness. Together, our framework and analysis provide a more rigorous and interpretable lens for evaluating and improving logical reasoning in LLMs.

      Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) error correction aims to correct recognition errors while preserving accurate text. Although traditional approaches demonstrate moderate effectiveness, LLMs offer a paradigm that eliminates the need for training and labeled data. However, directly using LLMs will encounter hallucinations problem, which may lead to the modification of the correct text. To address this problem, we propose the Reliable LLM Correction Framework (RLLM-CF), which consists of three stages: (1) error pre-detection, (2) chain-of-thought sub-tasks iterative correction, and (3) reasoning process verification. The advantage of our method is that it does not require additional information or fine-tuning of the model, and ensures the correctness of the LLM correction under multi-pass programming. Experiments on AISHELL-1, AISHELL-2, and Librispeech show that the GPT-4o model enhanced by our framework achieves 21%, 11%, 9%, and 11.4% relative reductions in CER/WER.

      Distilling reasoning paths from teacher to student models via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) provides a shortcut for improving the reasoning ability of smaller Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the reasoning paths generated by teacher models often reflect only surface-level traces of their underlying authentic reasoning. Insights from cognitive neuroscience suggest that authentic reasoning involves a complex interweaving between meta-reasoning (which selects appropriate sub-problems from multiple candidates) and solving (which addresses the sub-problem). This implies authentic reasoning has an implicit multi-branch structure. Supervised fine-tuning collapses this rich structure into a flat sequence of token prediction in the teacher's reasoning path, preventing effective distillation of this structure to students. To address this limitation, we propose RLKD, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based distillation framework guided by a novel Generative Structure Reward Model (GSRM). Our GSRM converts reasoning paths into multiple meta-reasoning-solving steps and computes rewards to measure structural alignment between student and teacher reasoning. RLKD combines this reward with RL, enabling student LLMs to internalize the teacher's implicit multi-branch reasoning structure rather than merely mimicking fixed output paths. Experiments show RLKD surpasses standard SFT-RL pipelines even when trained on 0.1% of data under an RL-only regime, unlocking greater student reasoning potential than SFT-based distillation.

      Despite the success of Instruction Tuning (IT) in training large language models (LLMs), such models often leverage spurious or biased features learnt from their training data and can become misaligned, leading to undesired behaviours. While existing techniques can steer model behaviour at inference-time, they are often post-hoc and do not embed steering as an intrinsic model feature. In this work, we introduce Focus Instruction Tuning (FIT), which trains LLMs to condition their responses by focusing on specific features whilst ignoring others, leading to different behaviours based on what features are specified. Across diverse benchmarks, we demonstrate that FIT: (i) successfully steers behaviour at inference time; (ii) increases robustness by amplifying core task signals and down-weighting spurious cues; (iii) mitigates social bias by suppressing demographic attributes; and (iv) generalises under distribution shifts and to previously unseen focus features. FIT therefore offers a lightweight, intrinsic mechanism for building more robust, fair, and easily controllable LLMs.

      Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to increasingly diverse requests, accompanied with varying resource (compute and memory) demands to serve them. However, this in turn degrades the cost-efficiency of LLM serving as common practices primarily rely on homogeneous GPU resources. In response to this problem, this work conducts a thorough study about serving LLMs over heterogeneous GPU resources on cloud platforms. The rationale is that different GPU types exhibit distinct compute and memory characteristics, aligning well with the divergent resource demands of diverse requests. Particularly, through comprehensive benchmarking, we discover that the cost-efficiency of LLM serving can be substantially optimized by meticulously determining GPU composition, deployment configurations, and workload assignments. Subsequently, we design a scheduling algorithm via mixed-integer linear programming, aiming at deducing the most cost-efficient serving plan under the constraints of price budget and real-time GPU availability. Remarkably, our approach effectively outperforms homogeneous and heterogeneous baselines under a wide array of scenarios, covering diverse workload traces, varying GPU availablilities, and multi-model serving.

However, AIGVs still suffer from noticeable visual quality defects, such as noise, blurriness, frame jitter and low dynamic degree, which severely impact the user's viewing experience. Therefore, an effective automatic visual quality assessment is of great importance for AIGV content regulation and generative model improvement. In this work, we decompose the visual quality of AIGVs into three dimensions: technical quality, motion quality, and video semantics. For each dimension, we design corresponding encoder to achieve effective feature representation. Moreover, considering the outstanding performance of large language models (LLMs) in various vision and language tasks, we introduce a LLM as the quality regression module. To better enable the LLM to establish reasoning associations between multi-dimensional features and visual quality, we propose a specially designed multi-modal prompt engineering framework.

      The strong planning and reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have fostered the development of agent-based systems capable of leveraging external tools and interacting with increasingly complex environments. However, these powerful features also introduce a critical security risk: indirect prompt injection, a sophisticated attack vector that compromises the core of these agents, the LLM, by manipulating contextual information rather than direct user prompts. In this work, we propose a generic black-box fuzzing framework, AgentFuzzer, designed to automatically discover and exploit indirect prompt injection vulnerabilities across diverse LLM agents. Our approach starts by constructing a high-quality initial seed corpus, then employs a seed selection algorithm based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to iteratively refine inputs, thereby maximizing the likelihood of uncovering agent weaknesses. We evaluate AgentFuzzer on two public benchmarks, AgentDojo and VWA-adv, where it achieves 71% and 70% success rates against agents based on o3-mini and GPT-4o, respectively, nearly doubling the performance of baseline attacks. Moreover, AgentFuzzer exhibits strong transferability across unseen tasks and internal LLMs, as well as promising results against defenses. Beyond benchmark evaluations, we apply our attacks in real-world environments, successfully misleading agents to navigate to arbitrary URLs, including malicious sites.

By comparing manually crafted agents to those evolved entirely by LLMs, we evaluate how effectively these systems can diagnose failure and adapt over time. Our results show that self-evolving agents, particularly when powered by models like Claude 3.7 and GPT-4o, outperform static baselines by autonomously adopting their strategies, passing along sample behavior to game-playing agents, and demonstrating adaptive reasoning over multiple iterations.

      Conventional biomedical research is increasingly labor-intensive due to the exponential growth of scientific literature and datasets. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has the potential to revolutionize this process by automating various steps. Still, significant challenges remain, including the need for multidisciplinary expertise, logicality of experimental design, and performance measurements. This paper introduces BioResearcher, the first end-to-end automated system designed to streamline the entire biomedical research process involving dry lab experiments. BioResearcher employs a modular multi-agent architecture, integrating specialized agents for search, literature processing, experimental design, and programming. By decomposing complex tasks into logically related sub-tasks and utilizing a hierarchical learning approach, BioResearcher effectively addresses the challenges of multidisciplinary requirements and logical complexity. Furthermore, BioResearcher incorporates an LLM-based reviewer for in-process quality control and introduces novel evaluation metrics to assess the quality and automation of experimental protocols. BioResearcher successfully achieves an average execution success rate of 63.07% across eight previously unmet research objectives. The generated protocols, on average, outperform typical agent systems by 22.0% on five quality metrics. The system demonstrates significant potential to reduce researchers' workloads and accelerate biomedical discoveries, paving the way for future innovations in automated research systems.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as promising tools for knowledge tracing (KT) due to their strong reasoning and generalization abilities. While recent LLM-based KT methods have proposed new prompt formats, they struggle to represent the full interaction histories of example learners within a single prompt during in-context learning (ICL), resulting in limited scalability and high computational cost under token constraints. In this work, we present \textit{LLM-based Option-weighted Knowledge Tracing (LOKT)}, a simple yet effective framework that encodes the interaction histories of example learners in context as \textit{textual categorical option weights (TCOW)}. TCOW are semantic labels (e.g., ``inadequate'') assigned to the options selected by learners when answering questions, enhancing the interpretability of LLMs. Experiments on multiple-choice datasets show that LOKT outperforms existing non-LLM and LLM-based KT models in both cold-start and warm-start settings. Moreover, LOKT enables scalable and cost-efficient inference, achieving strong performance even under strict token constraints.

      Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs), achieving state-of-the-art performance on tasks with structured, verifiable answers. Applying RLVR to Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) presents significant opportunities but is complicated by the broader, heterogeneous nature of vision-language tasks that demand nuanced visual, logical, and spatial capabilities. As such, training MLLMs using RLVR on multiple datasets could be beneficial but creates challenges with conflicting objectives from interaction among diverse datasets, highlighting the need for optimal dataset mixture strategies to improve generalization and reasoning. We introduce a systematic post-training framework for Multimodal LLM RLVR, featuring a rigorous data mixture problem formulation and benchmark implementation. Specifically, (1) We developed a multimodal RLVR framework for multi-dataset post-training by curating a dataset that contains different verifiable vision-language problems and enabling multi-domain online RL learning with different verifiable rewards; (2) We proposed a data mixture strategy that learns to predict the RL fine-tuning outcome from the data mixture distribution, and consequently optimizes the best mixture. Comprehensive experiments showcase that multi-domain RLVR training, when combined with mixture prediction strategies, can significantly boost MLLM general reasoning capacities. Our best mixture improves the post-trained model's accuracy on out-of-distribution benchmarks by an average of 5.24% compared to the same model post-trained with uniform data mixture, and by a total of 20.74% compared to the pre-finetuning baseline.

      We have witnessed that strong LLMs like Qwen-Math, MiMo, and Phi-4 possess immense reasoning potential inherited from the pre-training stage. With reinforcement learning (RL), these models can improve dramatically on reasoning tasks. Recent studies have shown that even RL on a single problem can unleash these models' reasoning capabilities. However, RL is not only expensive but also unstable. Even one-shot RL requires hundreds of GPU hours. This raises a critical question: Is there a more efficient way to unleash the reasoning potential of these powerful base LLMs? In this work, we demonstrate that Critique Fine-Tuning (CFT) on only one problem can effectively unleash the reasoning potential of LLMs. Our method constructs critique data by collecting diverse model-generated solutions to a single problem and using teacher LLMs to provide detailed critiques. We fine-tune Qwen and Llama family models, ranging from 1.5B to 14B parameters, on the CFT data and observe significant performance gains across diverse reasoning tasks. For example, with just 5 GPU hours of training, Qwen-Math-7B-CFT show an average improvement of 15% on six math benchmarks and 16% on three logic reasoning benchmarks. These results are comparable to or even surpass the results from RL with 20x less compute. Ablation studies reveal the robustness of one-shot CFT across different prompt problems. These results highlight one-shot CFT as a simple, general, and compute-efficient approach to unleashing the reasoning capabilities of modern LLMs.

      WiFi networks have achieved remarkable success in enabling seamless communication and data exchange worldwide. The IEEE 802.11be standard, known as WiFi 7, introduces Multi-Link Operation (MLO), a groundbreaking feature that enables devices to establish multiple simultaneous connections across different bands and channels. While MLO promises substantial improvements in network throughput and latency reduction, it presents significant challenges in channel allocation, particularly in dense network environments. Current research has predominantly focused on performance analysis and throughput optimization within static WiFi 7 network configurations. In contrast, this paper addresses the dynamic channel allocation problem in dense WiFi 7 networks with MLO capabilities. We formulate this challenge as a combinatorial optimization problem, leveraging a novel network performance analysis mechanism. Given the inherent lack of prior network information, we model the problem within a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework to enable online learning of optimal channel allocations. Our proposed Best-Arm Identification-enabled Monte Carlo Tree Search (BAI-MCTS) algorithm includes rigorous theoretical analysis, providing upper bounds for both sample complexity and error probability. To further reduce sample complexity and enhance generalizability across diverse network scenarios, we put forth LLM-BAI-MCTS, an intelligent algorithm for the dynamic channel allocation problem by integrating the Large Language Model (LLM) into the BAI-MCTS algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the BAI-MCTS algorithm achieves a convergence rate approximately $50.44\%$ faster than the state-of-the-art algorithms when reaching $98\%$ of the optimal value. Notably, the convergence rate of the LLM-BAI-MCTS algorithm increases by over $63.32\%$ in dense networks.

      With the growing adoption of reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) for aligning large language models (LLMs), the risk of backdoor installation during alignment has increased, leading to unintended and harmful behaviors. Existing backdoor triggers are typically limited to fixed word patterns, making them detectable during data cleaning and easily removable post-poisoning. In this work, we explore the use of prompt-specific paraphrases as backdoor triggers, enhancing their stealth and resistance to removal during LLM alignment. We propose AdvBDGen, an adversarially fortified generative fine-tuning framework that automatically generates prompt-specific backdoors that are effective, stealthy, and transferable across models. AdvBDGen employs a generator-discriminator pair, fortified by an adversary, to ensure the installability and stealthiness of backdoors. It enables the crafting and successful installation of complex triggers using as little as 3% of the fine-tuning data. Once installed, these backdoors can jailbreak LLMs during inference, demonstrate improved stability against perturbations compared to traditional constant triggers, and are more challenging to remove. These findings underscore an urgent need for the research community to develop more robust defenses against adversarial backdoor threats in LLM alignment.

      Neuro-symbolic approaches combining large language models (LLMs) with solvers excels in logical reasoning problems need long reasoning chains. In this paradigm, LLMs serve as translators, converting natural language reasoning problems into formal logic formulas. Then reliable symbolic solvers return correct solutions. Despite their success, we find that LLMs, as translators, struggle to handle lexical diversification, a common linguistic phenomenon, indicating that LLMs as logic translators are unreliable in real-world scenarios. Moreover, existing logical reasoning benchmarks lack lexical diversity, failing to challenge LLMs' ability to translate such text and thus obscuring this issue. In this work, we propose SCALe, a benchmark designed to address this significant gap through **logic-invariant lexical diversification**. By using LLMs to transform original benchmark datasets into lexically diversified but logically equivalent versions, we evaluate LLMs' ability to consistently map diverse expressions to uniform logical symbols on these new datasets. Experiments using SCALe further confirm that current LLMs exhibit deficiencies in this capability. Building directly on the deficiencies identified through our benchmark, we propose a new method, MenTaL, to address this limitation. This method guides LLMs to first construct a table unifying diverse expressions before performing translation. Applying MenTaL through in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) significantly improves the performance of LLM translators on lexically diversified text.

These systems enable more capable and context-aware behaviors by composing multiple specialized modules into cohesive workflows. Despite growing adoption in both academia and industry, the CAIS landscape remains fragmented, lacking a unified framework for analysis, taxonomy, and evaluation. In this survey, we define the concept of CAIS, propose a multi-dimensional taxonomy based on component roles and orchestration strategies, and analyze four foundational paradigms: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LLM Agents, Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), and orchestration-centric architectures. We review representative systems, compare design trade-offs, and summarize evaluation methodologies across these paradigms. Finally, we identify key challenges-including scalability, interoperability, benchmarking, and coordination-and outline promising directions for future research. This survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive foundation for understanding, developing, and advancing the next generation of system-level artificial intelligence.

      Evaluating machine translation (MT) quality for under-resourced African languages remains a significant challenge, as existing metrics often suffer from limited language coverage and poor performance in low-resource settings. While recent efforts, such as AfriCOMET, have addressed some of the issues, they are still constrained by small evaluation sets, a lack of publicly available training data tailored to African languages, and inconsistent performance in extremely low-resource scenarios. In this work, we introduce SSA-MTE, a large-scale human-annotated MT evaluation (MTE) dataset covering 13 African language pairs from the News domain, with over 63,000 sentence-level annotations from a diverse set of MT systems. Based on this data, we develop SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE, improved reference-based and reference-free evaluation metrics. We also benchmark prompting-based approaches using state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude. Our experimental results show that SSA-COMET models significantly outperform AfriCOMET and are competitive with the strongest LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro) evaluated in our study, particularly on low-resource languages such as Twi, Luo, and Yoruba.

Existing automation efforts using methods like Bayesian Optimization (BO) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are sub-optimal and costly to generalize across different topologies and technology nodes. In our work, we introduce a novel approach, LEDRO, utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) in conjunction with optimization techniques to iteratively refine the design space for analog circuit sizing. LEDRO is highly generalizable compared to other RL and BO baselines, eliminating the need for design annotation or model training for different topologies or technology nodes. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our proposed framework and baseline on 22 different Op-Amp topologies across four FinFET technology nodes. Results demonstrate the superior performance of LEDRO as it outperforms our best baseline by an average of 13% FoM improvement with 2.15x speed-up on low complexity Op-Amps and 48% FoM improvement with 1.7x speed-up on high complexity Op-Amps. This highlights LEDRO's effective performance, efficiency, and generalizability.

      What makes a difference in the post-training of LLMs? We investigate the training patterns of different layers in large language models (LLMs) through the lens of the gradient. We are specifically interested in how fast vs. slow thinking affects the layer-wise gradients, given the recent popularity of training LLMs on reasoning paths such as chain-of-thoughts (CoT) and process rewards. In our study, fast thinking without CoT leads to larger gradients and larger differences of gradients across layers than slow thinking (Detailed CoT), indicating the learning stability brought by the latter. Additionally, we study whether the gradient patterns can reflect the correctness of responses when training different LLMs using slow vs. fast thinking paths. The results show that the gradients of slow thinking can distinguish correct and irrelevant reasoning paths. As a comparison, we conduct similar gradient analyses on non-reasoning knowledge learning tasks, on which, however, trivially increasing the response length does not lead to similar behaviors of slow thinking. Our study strengthens fundamental understandings of LLM training and sheds novel insights on its efficiency and stability, which pave the way towards building a generalizable System-2 agent.

      Traditional offline evaluation methods for recommender systems struggle to capture the complexity of modern platforms due to sparse behavioural signals, noisy data, and limited modelling of user personality traits. While simulation frameworks can generate synthetic data to address these gaps, existing methods fail to replicate behavioural diversity, limiting their effectiveness. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Personality-driven User Behaviour Simulator (PUB), an LLM-based simulation framework that integrates the Big Five personality traits to model personalised user behaviour. PUB dynamically infers user personality from behavioural logs (e.g., ratings, reviews) and item metadata, then generates synthetic interactions that preserve statistical fidelity to real-world data. Experiments on the Amazon review datasets show that logs generated by PUB closely align with real user behaviour and reveal meaningful associations between personality traits and recommendation outcomes. These results highlight the potential of the personality-driven simulator to advance recommender system evaluation, offering scalable, controllable, high-fidelity alternatives to resource-intensive real-world experiments.

      Neural machine translation (NMT) systems typically employ maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding to select the highest-scoring translation from the distribution mass. However, recent evidence highlights the inadequacy of MAP decoding, often resulting in low-quality or even pathological hypotheses -- the decoding objective is not aligned with real-world translation quality. This paper proposes calibrating hypothesis likelihoods with translation quality from a distribution view by directly optimizing their Pearson correlation -- thereby enhancing the effectiveness of translation decoding. With our method, translation on large language models (LLMs) improves substantially after limited training (2K instances per direction). This improvement is orthogonal to those achieved through supervised fine-tuning, leading to substantial gains across a broad range of metrics and human evaluations -- even when applied to top-performing translation-specialized LLMs fine-tuned on high-quality translation data, such as Tower, or when compared to recent preference optimization methods, like CPO. Moreover, the calibrated translation likelihood can directly serve as a strong proxy for translation quality, closely approximating or even surpassing some state-of-the-art translation quality estimation models, like CometKiwi. Lastly, our in-depth analysis demonstrates that calibration enhances the effectiveness of MAP decoding, thereby enabling greater efficiency in real-world deployment. The resulting state-of-the-art translation model, which covers 10 languages, along with the accompanying code and human evaluation data, has been released to the community: https://github.com/moore3930/calibrating-llm-mt.

However, IaCGen transforms this performance dramatically: all evaluated models reach over 90% passItr@25, with Claude-3.5 and Claude-3.7 achieving 98% success rate. Despite these improvements, critical challenges remain in user intent alignment (25.2% accuracy) and security compliance (8.4% pass rate), highlighting areas requiring continued research.

      Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant performance gains via scaling up model sizes and/or data. However, recent evidence suggests diminishing returns from such approaches, motivating scaling the computation spent at inference time. Existing inference-time scaling methods, usually with reward models, cast the task as a search problem, which tends to be vulnerable to reward hacking as a consequence of approximation errors in reward models. In this paper, we instead cast inference-time scaling as a probabilistic inference task and leverage sampling-based techniques to explore the typical set of the state distribution of a state-space model with an approximate likelihood, rather than optimize for its mode directly. We propose a novel inference-time scaling approach by adapting particle-based Monte Carlo methods to this task. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that our methods have a 4-16x better scaling rate over our deterministic search counterparts on various challenging mathematical reasoning tasks. Using our approach, we show that Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B-Instruct can surpass GPT-4o accuracy in only 4 rollouts, while Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct scales to o1 level accuracy in only 32 rollouts.
