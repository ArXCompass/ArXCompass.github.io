      The incivility prevalent on platforms like Twitter (now X) and Reddit poses a challenge for developing AI systems that can support productive and rhetorically sound political argumentation. In this study, we report experiments with GPT-3.5 Turbo, fine-tuned on two contrasting datasets of political discussions: high-variance, high-incivility Twitter replies to U.S. Congress, and low-variance, low-incivility posts from Reddit's r/ChangeMyView. We systematically evaluate how these data sources and prompting strategies shape the rhetorical framing and deliberative quality of model-generated arguments. Our results show that Reddit-finetuned models produce safer but rhetorically rigid arguments, while cross-platform fine-tuning amplifies toxicity. Prompting reduces specific toxic behaviors, such as personal attacks, but fails to fully mitigate the influence of high-incivility training data. We introduce and validate a rhetorical evaluation rubric and provide practical guidelines for deploying LLMs in content authoring, moderation, and deliberation support.

      Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate feedback, yet their impact on learning remains underexplored, especially compared to existing feedback methods. This study investigates how on-demand LLM-generated explanatory feedback influences learning in seven scenario-based tutor training lessons. Analyzing over 2,600 lesson completions from 885 tutor learners, we compare posttest performance among learners across three groups: learners who received feedback generated by gpt-3.5-turbo, those who declined it, and those without access. All groups received non-LLM corrective feedback. To address potential selection bias-where higher-performing learners may be more inclined to use LLM feedback-we applied propensity scoring. Learners with a higher predicted likelihood of engaging with LLM feedback scored significantly higher at posttest than those with lower propensity. After adjusting for this effect, two out of seven lessons showed statistically significant learning benefits from LLM feedback with standardized effect sizes of 0.28 and 0.33. These moderate effects suggest that the effectiveness of LLM feedback depends on the learners' tendency to seek support. Importantly, LLM feedback did not significantly increase completion time, and learners overwhelmingly rated it as helpful. These findings highlight LLM feedback's potential as a low-cost and scalable way to improve learning on open-ended tasks, particularly in existing systems already providing feedback without LLMs. This work contributes open datasets, LLM prompts, and rubrics to support reproducibility.

      LaTeX's precision and flexibility in typesetting have made it the gold standard for the preparation of scientific documentation. Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising opportunity for researchers to produce publication-ready material using LaTeX with natural language instructions, yet current benchmarks completely lack evaluation of this ability. By introducing TeXpert, our benchmark dataset with natural language prompts for generating LaTeX code focused on components of scientific documents across multiple difficulty levels, we conduct an in-depth analysis of LLM performance in this regard and identify frequent error types. Our evaluation across open and closed-source LLMs highlights multiple key findings: LLMs excelling on standard benchmarks perform poorly in LaTeX generation with a significant accuracy drop-off as the complexity of tasks increases; open-source models like DeepSeek v3 and DeepSeek Coder strongly rival closed-source counterparts in LaTeX tasks; and formatting and package errors are unexpectedly prevalent, suggesting a lack of diverse LaTeX examples in the training datasets of most LLMs. Our dataset, code, and model evaluations are available at https://github.com/knowledge-verse-ai/TeXpert.

      Generating SQLs from user queries is a long-standing challenge, where the accuracy of initial schema linking significantly impacts subsequent SQL generation performance. However, current schema linking models still struggle with missing relevant schema elements or an excess of redundant ones. A crucial reason for this is that commonly used metrics, recall and precision, fail to capture relevant element missing and thus cannot reflect actual schema linking performance. Motivated by this, we propose enhanced schema linking metrics by introducing a restricted missing indicator. Accordingly, we introduce Knapsack optimization-based Schema Linking Approach (KaSLA), a plug-in schema linking method designed to prevent the missing of relevant schema elements while minimizing the inclusion of redundant ones. KaSLA employs a hierarchical linking strategy that first identifies the optimal table linking and subsequently links columns within the selected table to reduce linking candidate space. In each linking process, it utilizes a knapsack optimization approach to link potentially relevant elements while accounting for a limited tolerance of potentially redundant ones. With this optimization, KaSLA-1.6B achieves superior schema linking results compared to large-scale LLMs, including deepseek-v3 with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) schema linking method. Extensive experiments on Spider and BIRD benchmarks verify that KaSLA can significantly improve the SQL generation performance of SOTA Text2SQL models by substituting their schema linking processes.

      In machine learning, contamination refers to situations where testing data leak into the training set. The issue is particularly relevant for the evaluation of the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), which are generally trained on gargantuan, and generally opaque, corpora of text scraped from the world wide web. Developing tools to detect contamination is therefore crucial to be able to fairly and properly track the evolution of the performance of LLMs. To date, only a few recent studies have attempted to address the issue of quantifying and detecting contamination in short text sequences, such as those commonly found in benchmarks. However, these methods have limitations that can sometimes render them impractical. In the present paper, we introduce LogProber, a novel, efficient algorithm that we show to be able to detect contamination in a black box setting that tries to tackle some of these drawbacks by focusing on the familiarity with the question rather than the answer. Here, we explore the properties of the proposed method in comparison with concurrent approaches, identify its advantages and limitations, and illustrate how different forms of contamination can go undetected depending on the design of the detection algorithm.

      The code generation capabilities of large language models(LLMs) have emerged as a critical dimension in evaluating their overall performance. However, prior research has largely overlooked the security risks inherent in the generated code. In this work, we introduce SafeGenBench, a benchmark specifically designed to assess the security of LLM-generated code. The dataset encompasses a wide range of common software development scenarios and vulnerability types. Building upon this benchmark, we develop an automatic evaluation framework that leverages both static application security testing(SAST) and LLM-based judging to assess the presence of security vulnerabilities in model-generated code. Through the empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs on SafeGenBench, we reveal notable deficiencies in their ability to produce vulnerability-free code. Our findings highlight pressing challenges and offer actionable insights for future advancements in the secure code generation performance of LLMs. The data and code will be released soon.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      We develop a framework to quantify the time-to-unsafe-sampling - the number of large language model (LLM) generations required to trigger an unsafe (e.g., toxic) response. Estimating this quantity is challenging, since unsafe responses are exceedingly rare in well-aligned LLMs, potentially occurring only once in thousands of generations. As a result, directly estimating time-to-unsafe-sampling would require collecting training data with a prohibitively large number of generations per prompt. However, with realistic sampling budgets, we often cannot generate enough responses to observe an unsafe outcome for every prompt, leaving the time-to-unsafe-sampling unobserved in many cases, making the estimation and evaluation tasks particularly challenging. To address this, we frame this estimation problem as one of survival analysis and develop a provably calibrated lower predictive bound (LPB) on the time-to-unsafe-sampling of a given prompt, leveraging recent advances in conformal prediction. Our key innovation is designing an adaptive, per-prompt sampling strategy, formulated as a convex optimization problem. The objective function guiding this optimized sampling allocation is designed to reduce the variance of the estimators used to construct the LPB, leading to improved statistical efficiency over naive methods that use a fixed sampling budget per prompt. Experiments on both synthetic and real data support our theoretical results and demonstrate the practical utility of our method for safety risk assessment in generative AI models.

      Penetration-testing, while critical for validating defenses and uncovering vulnerabilities, is often limited by high operational costs and the scarcity of human expertise. This paper investigates the feasibility and effectiveness of using Large Language Model (LLM)-driven autonomous systems to address these challenges in real-world Microsoft Active Directory (AD) enterprise networks. Our novel prototype, cochise, represents the first demonstration of a fully autonomous, LLM-driven framework capable of compromising accounts within a real-life Microsoft AD testbed (GOAD). The evaluation deliberately utilizes GOAD to capture the intricate interactions and sometimes nondeterministic outcomes of live network pen-testing, moving beyond the limitations of synthetic benchmarks. We perform our empirical evaluation using five LLMs, comparing reasoning to non-reasoning models as well as including open-weight models. Through comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analysis, incorporating insights from cybersecurity experts, we demonstrate that autonomous LLMs can effectively conduct Assumed Breach simulations. Key findings highlight their ability to dynamically adapt attack strategies, perform inter-context attacks, and generate scenario-specific attack parameters. Cochise also exhibits robust self-correction mechanisms, automatically installing missing tools and rectifying invalid command generations. Critically, we find that the associated costs are competitive with those incurred by professional pen-testers, suggesting a path toward democratizing access to essential security testing for organizations with budgetary constraints. However, our research also illuminates existing limitations, including instances of LLM ``going down rabbit holes'', challenges in comprehensive information transfer between planning and execution modules, and critical safety concerns that necessitate human oversight.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate promising capabilities in solving scientific problems but often suffer from the issue of hallucination. While integrating LLMs with tools can mitigate this issue, models fine-tuned on tool usage become overreliant on them and incur unnecessary costs. Inspired by how human experts assess problem complexity before selecting solutions, we propose a novel two-component fine-tuning method, Adapting While Learning (AWL). In the first component, World Knowledge Learning (WKL), LLMs internalize scientific knowledge by learning from tool-generated solutions. In the second component, Tool Usage Adaptation (TUA), we categorize problems as easy or hard based on the model's accuracy, and train it to maintain direct reasoning for easy problems while switching to tools for hard ones. We validate our method on six scientific benchmark datasets across climate science, epidemiology, physics, and other domains. Compared to the original instruct model (8B), models post-trained with AWL achieve 29.11% higher answer accuracy and 12.72% better tool usage accuracy, even surpassing state-of-the-art models including GPT-4o and Claude-3.5 on four custom-created datasets.

      Traditional technical analysis methods face limitations in accurately predicting trends in today's complex financial markets. This paper introduces ElliottAgents, an multi-agent system that integrates the Elliott Wave Principle with AI for stock market forecasting. The inherent complexity of financial markets, characterized by non-linear dynamics, noise, and susceptibility to unpredictable external factors, poses significant challenges for accurate prediction. To address these challenges, the system employs LLMs to enhance natural language understanding and decision-making capabilities within a multi-agent framework. By leveraging technologies such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), ElliottAgents performs continuous, multi-faceted analysis of market data to identify wave patterns and predict future price movements. The research explores the system's ability to process historical stock data, recognize Elliott wave patterns, and generate actionable insights for traders. Experimental results, conducted on historical data from major U.S. companies, validate the system's effectiveness in pattern recognition and trend forecasting across various time frames. This paper contributes to the field of AI-driven financial analysis by demonstrating how traditional technical analysis methods can be effectively combined with modern AI approaches to create more reliable and interpretable market prediction systems.

      Batch prompting, which combines a batch of multiple queries sharing the same context in one inference, has emerged as a promising solution to reduce inference costs. However, our study reveals a significant security vulnerability in batch prompting: malicious users can inject attack instructions into a batch, leading to unwanted interference across all queries, which can result in the inclusion of harmful content, such as phishing links, or the disruption of logical reasoning. In this paper, we construct BATCHSAFEBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 150 attack instructions of two types and 8k batch instances, to study the batch prompting vulnerability systematically. Our evaluation of both closed-source and open-weight LLMs demonstrates that all LLMs are susceptible to batch-prompting attacks. We then explore multiple defending approaches. While the prompting-based defense shows limited effectiveness for smaller LLMs, the probing-based approach achieves about 95% accuracy in detecting attacks. Additionally, we perform a mechanistic analysis to understand the attack and identify attention heads that are responsible for it.

      The ability to follow instructions accurately is fundamental for Large Language Models (LLMs) to serve as reliable agents in real-world applications. For complex instructions, LLMs often struggle to fulfill all requirements in a single attempt. In practice, users typically provide iterative feedback until the LLM generates a response that meets all requirements. However, existing instruction-following benchmarks are either single-turn or introduce new requirements in each turn without allowing self-correction. To address this gap, we propose Meeseeks. Meeseeks simulates realistic human-LLM interactions through an iterative feedback framework, which enables models to self-correct based on specific requirement failures in each turn, better reflecting real-world user-end usage patterns. Meanwhile, the benchmark implements a comprehensive evaluation system with 38 capability tags organized across three dimensions: Intent Recognition, Granular Content Validation, and Output Structure Validation. Through rigorous evaluation across LLMs, Meeseeks provides valuable insights into LLMs' instruction-following capabilities in multi-turn scenarios.

      Large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities to generate concise summaries of patient information and alleviate the burden of clinical documentation that overwhelms healthcare providers. We present Distillnote, a framework for LLM-based clinical note summarization, and generate over 64,000 admission note summaries through three techniques: (1) One-step, direct summarization, and a divide-and-conquer approach involving (2) Structured summarization focused on independent clinical insights, and (3) Distilled summarization that further condenses the Structured summaries. We test how useful are the summaries by using them to predict heart failure compared to a model trained on the original notes. Distilled summaries achieve 79% text compression and up to 18.2% improvement in AUPRC compared to an LLM trained on the full notes. We also evaluate the quality of the generated summaries in an LLM-as-judge evaluation as well as through blinded pairwise comparisons with clinicians. Evaluations indicate that one-step summaries are favoured by clinicians according to relevance and clinical actionability, while distilled summaries offer optimal efficiency (avg. 6.9x compression-to-performance ratio) and significantly reduce hallucinations. We release our summaries on PhysioNet to encourage future research.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming the landscape of digital content creation. However, the prevalent black-box Application Programming Interface (API) access to many LLMs introduces significant challenges in accountability, governance, and security. LLM fingerprinting, which aims to identify the source model by analyzing statistical and stylistic features of generated text, offers a potential solution. Current progress in this area is hindered by a lack of dedicated datasets and the need for efficient, practical methods that are robust against adversarial manipulations. To address these challenges, we introduce FD-Dataset, a comprehensive bilingual fingerprinting benchmark comprising 90,000 text samples from 20 famous proprietary and open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we present FDLLM, a novel fingerprinting method that leverages parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune a foundation model. This approach enables LoRA to extract deep, persistent features that characterize each source LLM. Through our analysis, we find that LoRA adaptation promotes the aggregation of outputs from the same LLM in representation space while enhancing the separation between different LLMs. This mechanism explains why LoRA proves particularly effective for LLM fingerprinting. Extensive empirical evaluations on FD-Dataset demonstrate FDLLM's superiority, achieving a Macro F1 score 22.1% higher than the strongest baseline. FDLLM also exhibits strong generalization to newly released models, achieving an average accuracy of 95% on unseen models. Notably, FDLLM remains consistently robust under various adversarial attacks, including polishing, translation, and synonym substitution. Experimental results show that FDLLM reduces the average attack success rate from 49.2% (LM-D) to 23.9%.

      Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted across psychology, serving as research tools, experimental subjects, human simulators, and computational models of cognition. However, the application of human measurement tools to these systems can produce contradictory results, raising concerns that many findings are measurement phantoms--statistical artifacts rather than genuine psychological phenomena. In this Perspective, we argue that building a robust science of AI psychology requires integrating two of our field's foundational pillars: the principles of reliable measurement and the standards for sound causal inference. We present a dual-validity framework to guide this integration, which clarifies how the evidence needed to support a claim scales with its scientific ambition. Using an LLM to classify text may require only basic accuracy checks, whereas claiming it can simulate anxiety demands a far more rigorous validation process. Current practice systematically fails to meet these requirements, often treating statistical pattern matching as evidence of psychological phenomena. The same model output--endorsing "I am anxious"--requires different validation strategies depending on whether researchers claim to measure, characterize, simulate, or model psychological constructs. Moving forward requires developing computational analogues of psychological constructs and establishing clear, scalable standards of evidence rather than the uncritical application of human measurement tools.

In this study, we evaluate the performance of two LLM- based diagnostic tools, DeepSeek R1 and O3 Mini, using a structured dataset of symptoms and diagnoses. We assessed their predictive accuracy at both the disease and category levels, as well as the reliability of their confidence scores. DeepSeek R1 achieved a disease-level accuracy of 76% and an overall accuracy of 82%, outperforming O3 Mini, which attained 72% and 75% respectively. Notably, DeepSeek R1 demonstrated exceptional performance in Mental Health, Neurological Disorders, and Oncology, where it reached 100% accuracy, while O3 Mini excelled in Autoimmune Disease classification with 100% accuracy. Both models, however, struggled with Respiratory Disease classification, recording accuracies of only 40% for DeepSeek R1 and 20% for O3 Mini. Additionally, the analysis of confidence scores revealed that DeepSeek R1 provided high-confidence predictions in 92% of cases, compared to 68% for O3 Mini. Ethical considerations regarding bias, model interpretability, and data privacy are also discussed to ensure the responsible integration of LLMs into clinical practice. Overall, our findings offer valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of LLM-based diagnostic systems and provide a roadmap for future enhancements in AI-driven healthcare.

      Medical Question-Answering (QA) encompasses a broad spectrum of tasks, including multiple choice questions (MCQ), open-ended text generation, and complex computational reasoning. Despite this variety, a unified framework for delivering high-quality medical QA has yet to emerge. Although recent progress in reasoning-augmented large language models (LLMs) has shown promise, their ability to achieve comprehensive medical understanding is still largely unexplored. In this paper, we present Med-U1, a unified framework for robust reasoning across medical QA tasks with diverse output formats, ranging from MCQs to complex generation and computation tasks. Med-U1 employs pure large-scale reinforcement learning with mixed rule-based binary reward functions, incorporating a length penalty to manage output verbosity. With multi-objective reward optimization, Med-U1 directs LLMs to produce concise and verifiable reasoning chains. Empirical results reveal that Med-U1 significantly improves performance across multiple challenging Med-QA benchmarks, surpassing even larger specialized and proprietary models. Furthermore, Med-U1 demonstrates robust generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. Extensive analysis presents insights into training strategies, reasoning chain length control, and reward design for medical LLMs. Our code is available here.

      High-definition maps (HD maps) are detailed and informative maps capturing lane centerlines and road elements. Although very useful for autonomous driving, HD maps are costly to build and maintain. Furthermore, access to these high-quality maps is usually limited to the firms that build them. On the other hand, standard definition (SD) maps provide road centerlines with an accuracy of a few meters. In this paper, we explore the possibility of enhancing SD maps by incorporating information from road manuals using LLMs. We develop SD++, an end-to-end pipeline to enhance SD maps with location-dependent road information obtained from a road manual. We suggest and compare several ways of using LLMs for such a task. Furthermore, we show the generalization ability of SD++ by showing results from both California and Japan.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Training large language models (LLMs) typically relies on adaptive optimizers such as Adam, which require significant memory to maintain first- and second-moment matrices, known as optimizer states. While recent works such as GaLore, Fira, and APOLLO have proposed state-compressed variants to reduce memory consumption, a fundamental question remains: What is the minimal amount of optimizer state that is truly necessary to retain state-of-the-art performance in LLM pretraining? In this work, we systematically investigate this question using a bottom-up approach. We find that two memory- and compute-efficient optimization techniques are particularly effective: (1) column-wise gradient normalization significantly boosts the performance of plain SGD without requiring momentum; and (2) adding first-order momentum only to the output layer - where gradient variance is highest - yields performance competitive with fully adaptive methods such as Muon. Based on these insights, we propose SCALE (Stochastic Column-normalized Last-layer Momentum), a new optimizer that combines column-normalized SGD with last-layer momentum, where column normalization refers to normalizing the gradient along the output dimension. Across multiple LLaMA models (60M-1B), SCALE matches or exceeds the performance of Adam while using only 35-45% of the total memory. It also consistently outperforms memory-efficient optimizers such as GaLore, Fira, and APOLLO, making it a strong candidate for large-scale pretraining under memory constraints. For the LLaMA 7B model, SCALE outperforms the state-of-the-art method APOLLO in terms of both perplexity and memory consumption. In addition, our method serves as a minimalist baseline for more sophisticated optimizer design.

      Modern GPUs evolve rapidly, yet production compilers still rely on hand-crafted register allocation heuristics that require substantial re-tuning for each hardware generation. We introduce VeriLocc, a framework that combines large language models (LLMs) with formal compiler techniques to enable generalizable and verifiable register allocation across GPU architectures. VeriLocc fine-tunes an LLM to translate intermediate representations (MIRs) into target-specific register assignments, aided by static analysis for cross-architecture normalization and generalization and a verifier-guided regeneration loop to ensure correctness. Evaluated on matrix multiplication (GEMM) and multi-head attention (MHA), VeriLocc achieves 85-99% single-shot accuracy and near-100% pass@100. Case study shows that VeriLocc discovers more performant assignments than expert-tuned libraries, outperforming rocBLAS by over 10% in runtime.

      Vector representations of contextual embeddings learned by pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are effective in various downstream tasks in numerical domains such as time series forecasting. Despite their significant benefits, the tendency of LLMs to hallucinate in such domains can have severe consequences in applications such as energy, nature, finance, healthcare, retail and transportation, among others. To guarantee prediction reliability and accuracy in numerical domains, it is necessary to open the black box behind the LLM and provide performance guarantees through explanation. However, there is little theoretical understanding of when pre-trained language models help solve numerical downstream tasks. This paper seeks to bridge this gap by understanding when the next-word prediction capability of LLMs can be adapted to numerical domains through a novel analysis based on the concept of isotropy in the contextual embedding space. Specifically, a log-linear model for LLMs is considered in which numerical data can be predicted from its context through a network with softmax in the output layer of LLMs (i.e., language model head in self-attention). For this model, it is demonstrated that, in order to achieve state-of-the-art performance in numerical domains, the hidden representations of the LLM embeddings must possess a structure that accounts for the shift-invariance of the softmax function. By formulating a gradient structure of self-attention in pre-trained models, it is shown how the isotropic property of LLM embeddings in contextual embedding space preserves the underlying structure of representations, thereby resolving the shift-invariance problem and providing a performance guarantee. Experiments show that different characteristics of numerical data and model architectures have different impacts on isotropy, and this variability directly affects the performances.

      Regardless of the advancements in device capabilities, efficient inferencing advanced large language models (LLMs) at the edge remains challenging due to limited device memory and power constraints. Existing strategies, such as aggressive quantization, pruning, or remote inference, trade accuracy for efficiency or lead to substantial cost burdens. This position paper introduces a new approach that leverages speculative decoding, previously viewed primarily as a decoding acceleration technique for autoregressive generation of LLMs, as a promising approach specifically adapted for edge computing by orchestrating computation across heterogeneous devices. We propose \acronym, a method that allows lightweight edge devices to draft multiple candidate tokens locally using diverse draft models, while a single, shared edge server efficiently batches and verifies the tokens utilizing a more precise target model. This approach supports device heterogeneity and reduces server-side memory footprint by avoiding the need to deploy multiple target models. Our initial experiments with Jetson Orin Nano, Raspberry Pi 4B/5, and an edge server equipped with 4 Nvidia A100 GPUs indicate substantial benefits: significantly increased system throughput, capacity, and better cost efficiency, all without sacrificing model accuracy.

      Efforts to improve Large Language Model (LLM) agent performance on complex tasks have largely focused on fine-tuning and iterative self-correction. However, these approaches often lack generalizable mechanisms for longterm learning and remain inefficient in dynamic environments. We introduce OmniReflect, a hierarchical, reflection-driven framework that constructs a constitution, a compact set of guiding principles distilled from task experiences, to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of an LLM agent. OmniReflect operates in two modes: Self-sustaining, where a single agent periodically curates its own reflections during task execution, and Co-operative, where a Meta-advisor derives a constitution from a small calibration set to guide another agent. To construct these constitutional principles, we employ Neural, Symbolic, and NeuroSymbolic techniques, offering a balance between contextual adaptability and computational efficiency. Empirical results averaged across models show major improvements in task success, with absolute gains of +10.3% on ALFWorld, +23.8% on BabyAI, and +8.3% on PDDL in the Self-sustaining mode. Similar gains are seen in the Co-operative mode, where a lightweight Qwen3-4B ReAct agent outperforms all Reflexion baselines on BabyAI. These findings highlight the robustness and effectiveness of OmniReflect across environments and backbones.

      The use of large language models (LLMs) is becoming common in the context of political science, particularly in studies that analyse individuals use of digital media. However, while previous research has demonstrated LLMs ability at labelling tasks, the effectiveness of using LLMs to classify political content (PC) from just URLs is not yet well explored. The work presented in this article bridges this gap by evaluating whether LLMs can accurately identify PC vs. non-PC from both the article text and the URLs from five countries (France, Germany, Spain, the UK, and the US) and different languages. Using cutting-edge LLMs like GPT, Llama, Mistral, Deepseek, Qwen and Gemma, we measure model performance to assess whether URL-level analysis can be a good approximation for full-text analysis of PC, even across different linguistic and national contexts. Model outputs are compared with human-labelled articles, as well as traditional supervised machine learning techniques, to set a baseline of performance. Overall, our findings suggest the capacity of URLs to embed most of the news content, providing a vital perspective on accuracy-cost balancing. We also account for contextual limitations and suggest methodological recommendations to use LLMs within political science studies.

      As Large Language Models (LLMs) are integrated into safety-critical applications involving sequential decision-making in the real world, it is essential to know when to trust LLM decisions. Existing LLM Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) methods are primarily designed for single-turn question-answering formats, resulting in multi-step decision-making scenarios, e.g., LLM agentic system, being underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a principled, information-theoretic framework that decomposes LLM sequential decision uncertainty into two parts: (i) internal uncertainty intrinsic to the current decision, which is focused on existing UQ methods, and (ii) extrinsic uncertainty, a Mutual-Information (MI) quantity describing how much uncertainty should be inherited from preceding decisions. We then propose UProp, an efficient and effective extrinsic uncertainty estimator that converts the direct estimation of MI to the estimation of Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) over multiple Trajectory-Dependent Decision Processes (TDPs). UProp is evaluated over extensive multi-step decision-making benchmarks, e.g., AgentBench and HotpotQA, with state-of-the-art LLMs, e.g., GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-V3. Experimental results demonstrate that UProp significantly outperforms existing single-turn UQ baselines equipped with thoughtful aggregation strategies. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive analysis of UProp, including sampling efficiency, potential applications, and intermediate uncertainty propagation, to demonstrate its effectiveness.

This present study investigates the feasibility and scalability of using generative AI to identify and evaluate specific tutor moves in real-life math tutoring. We analyze 50 randomly selected transcripts of college-student remote tutors assisting middle school students in mathematics. Using GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-4-turbo, Gemini-1.5-pro, and LearnLM, we assess tutors' application of two tutor skills: delivering effective praise and responding to student math errors. All models reliably detected relevant situations, for example, tutors providing praise to students (94-98% accuracy) and a student making a math error (82-88% accuracy) and effectively evaluated the tutors' adherence to tutoring best practices, aligning closely with human judgments (83-89% and 73-77%, respectively). We propose a cost-effective prompting strategy and discuss practical implications for using large language models to support scalable assessment in authentic settings.

      In the era of large language models (LLMs), code benchmarks have become an important research area in software engineering and are widely used by practitioners. These benchmarks evaluate the performance of LLMs on specific code-related tasks, such as code understanding and generation. A critical step in constructing code benchmarks is the design of prompts. However, as existing code benchmarks typically rely on a single prompt template per task, they are prone to the issue of prompt sensitivity, where minor prompt variations could result in substantial performance variations, leading to unreliable evaluations of model capabilities. While previous studies have explored prompt sensitivity, their experimental designs and findings are limited to traditional natural language processing (NLP) tasks. In this paper, we present an empirical study to investigate prompt sensitivity in code benchmarks. We first propose a general framework that modifies prompt templates in a manner that preserves both their semantics and their structure as much as possible. Based on the framework, we conduct extensive experiments across eight code benchmark tasks on 10 representative open-source LLMs, with each task featuring 100 semantically similar prompt templates. We then analyze the evaluation results using various statistical metrics, focusing on both absolute and relative model performance. Our findings suggest that even slight prompt variations can lead to significant shifts in performance. Additionally, we observe that such variations can introduce inconsistencies in the performance rankings across different models. These insights highlight the need for considering prompt sensitivity when designing future code benchmarks, to ensure more reliable and accurate evaluation of LLM capabilities.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed as near-autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents capable of making everyday decisions on behalf of humans. Although LLMs perform well on many technical tasks, their behaviour in personal decision-making remains less understood. Previous studies have assessed their rationality and moral alignment with human decisions. However, the behaviour of AI assistants in scenarios where financial rewards are at odds with user comfort has not yet been thoroughly explored. In this paper, we tackle this problem by quantifying the prices assigned by multiple LLMs to a series of user discomforts: additional walking, waiting, hunger and pain. We uncover several key concerns that strongly question the prospect of using current LLMs as decision-making assistants: (1) a large variance in responses between LLMs, (2) within a single LLM, responses show fragility to minor variations in prompt phrasing (e.g., reformulating the question in the first person can considerably alter the decision), (3) LLMs can accept unreasonably low rewards for major inconveniences (e.g., 1 Euro to wait 10 hours), and (4) LLMs can reject monetary gains where no discomfort is imposed (e.g., 1,000 Euro to wait 0 minutes). These findings emphasize the need for scrutiny of how LLMs value human inconvenience, particularly as we move toward applications where such cash-versus-comfort trade-offs are made on users' behalf.

      The increasing demand for domain-specific and human-aligned Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the widespread adoption of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) techniques. SFT datasets often comprise valuable instruction-response pairs, making them highly valuable targets for potential extraction. This paper studies this critical research problem for the first time. We start by formally defining and formulating the problem, then explore various attack goals, types, and variants based on the unique properties of SFT data in real-world scenarios. Based on our analysis of extraction behaviors of direct extraction, we develop a novel extraction method specifically designed for SFT models, called Differentiated Data Extraction (DDE), which exploits the confidence levels of fine-tuned models and their behavioral differences from pre-trained base models. Through extensive experiments across multiple domains and scenarios, we demonstrate the feasibility of SFT data extraction using DDE. Our results show that DDE consistently outperforms existing extraction baselines in all attack settings. To counter this new attack, we propose a defense mechanism that mitigates DDE attacks with minimal impact on model performance. Overall, our research reveals hidden data leak risks in fine-tuned LLMs and provides insights for developing more secure models.

      With the rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) -- each optimized for different strengths, style, or latency/cost profile -- routing has become an essential technique to operationalize the use of different models. However, existing LLM routing approaches are limited in two key ways: they evaluate performance using benchmarks that often fail to capture human preferences driven by subjective evaluation criteria, and they typically select from a limited pool of models. In this work, we propose a preference-aligned routing framework that guides model selection by matching queries to user-defined domains (e.g., travel) or action types (e.g., image editing) -- offering a practical mechanism to encode preferences in routing decisions. Specifically, we introduce \textbf{Arch-Router}, a compact 1.5B model that learns to map queries to domain-action preferences for model routing decisions. Our approach also supports seamlessly adding new models for routing without requiring retraining or architectural modifications. Experiments on conversational datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in matching queries with human preferences, outperforming top proprietary models. Our approach captures subjective evaluation criteria and makes routing decisions more transparent and flexible. Our model is available at: \texttt{https://huggingface.co/katanemo/Arch-Router-1.5B}.

Traditional approaches such as HTML boilerplate extraction or keyword filters often fail in multilingual settings and struggle with context-sensitive nuances, whereas Large Language Models (LLMs) offer improved quality at high computational cost. We introduce SORE (Semantic Outlier Removal), a cost-effective, transparent method that leverages multilingual sentence embeddings and approximate nearest-neighbor search to identify and excise unwanted text segments. By first identifying core content via metadata embedding and then flagging segments that either closely match predefined outlier groups or deviate significantly from the core, SORE achieves near-LLM extraction precision at a fraction of the cost. Experiments on HTML datasets demonstrate that SORE outperforms structural methods and yield high precision in diverse scenarios. Our system is currently deployed in production, processing millions of documents daily across multiple languages while maintaining both efficiency and accuracy.

      Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on several tasks and are increasingly deployed in real-world applications. However, especially in high-stakes settings, it becomes vital to know when the output of an LLM may be unreliable. Depending on whether an answer is trustworthy, a system can then choose to route the question to another expert, or otherwise fall back on a safe default behavior. In this work, we study the extent to which LLMs can reliably indicate confidence in their answers, and how this notion of confidence can translate into downstream accuracy gains. We propose Self-Reflection with Error-based Feedback (Self-REF), a lightweight training strategy to teach LLMs to express confidence in whether their answers are correct in a reliable manner. Self-REF introduces confidence tokens into the LLM, from which a confidence score can be extracted. Compared to conventional approaches such as verbalizing confidence and examining token probabilities, we demonstrate empirically that confidence tokens show significant improvements in downstream routing and rejection learning tasks.

      Requirements over strings, commonly represented using natural language (NL), are particularly relevant for software systems due to their heavy reliance on string data manipulation. While individual requirements can usually be analyzed manually, verifying properties (e.g., satisfiability) over sets of NL requirements is particularly challenging. Formal approaches (e.g., SMT solvers) may efficiently verify such properties, but are known to have theoretical limitations. Additionally, the translation of NL requirements into formal constraints typically requires significant manual effort. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as an alternative approach for formal reasoning tasks, but their effectiveness in verifying requirements over strings is less studied. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid approach that verifies the satisfiability of NL requirements over strings by using LLMs (1) to derive a satisfiability outcome (and a consistent string, if possible), and (2) to generate declarative (i.e., SMT) and imperative (i.e., Python) checkers, used to validate the correctness of (1). In our experiments, we assess the performance of four LLMs. Results show that LLMs effectively translate natural language into checkers, even achieving perfect testing accuracy for Python-based checkers. These checkers substantially help LLMs in generating a consistent string and accurately identifying unsatisfiable requirements, leading to more than doubled generation success rate and F1-score in certain cases compared to baselines without generated checkers.

However, their manual development and maintenance are labor-intensive, particularly in tasks with large linguistic variability. To overcome these limitations, we proposed a novel approach employing LLMs solely during the rule-based systems development phase. We conducted the initial experiments focusing on the first two steps of developing a rule-based NLP pipeline: find relevant snippets from the clinical note; extract informative keywords from the snippets for the rule-based named entity recognition (NER) component. Our experiments demonstrated exceptional recall in identifying clinically relevant text snippets (Deepseek: 0.98, Qwen: 0.99) and 1.0 in extracting key terms for NER.

      Understanding whether large language models (LLMs) possess a world model-a structured understanding of the world that supports generalization beyond surface-level patterns-is central to assessing their reliability, especially in high-stakes applications. We propose a formal framework for evaluating whether an LLM exhibits a sufficiently robust world model, defined as producing consistent outputs across semantically equivalent prompts while distinguishing between prompts that express different intents. We introduce a new evaluation approach to measure this that decomposes model response variability into three components: variability due to user purpose, user articulation, and model instability. An LLM with a strong world model should attribute most of the variability in its responses to changes in foundational purpose rather than superficial changes in articulation. This approach allows us to quantify how much of a model's behavior is semantically grounded rather than driven by model instability or alternative wording. We apply this framework to evaluate LLMs across diverse domains. Our results show how larger models attribute a greater share of output variability to changes in user purpose, indicating a more robust world model. This improvement is not uniform, however: larger models do not consistently outperform smaller ones across all domains, and their advantage in robustness is often modest. These findings highlight the importance of moving beyond accuracy-based benchmarks toward semantic diagnostics that more directly assess the structure and stability of a model's internal understanding of the world.

      Due to the size and complexity of modern large language models (LLMs), it has proven challenging to uncover the underlying mechanisms that models use to solve reasoning problems. For instance, is their reasoning for a specific problem localized to certain parts of the network? Do they break down the reasoning problem into modular components that are then executed as sequential steps as we go deeper in the model? To better understand the reasoning capability of LLMs, we study a minimal propositional logic problem that requires combining multiple facts to arrive at a solution. By studying this problem on Mistral and Gemma models, up to 27B parameters, we illuminate the core components the models use to solve such logic problems. From a mechanistic interpretability point of view, we use causal mediation analysis to uncover the pathways and components of the LLMs' reasoning processes. Then, we offer fine-grained insights into the functions of attention heads in different layers. We not only find a sparse circuit that computes the answer, but we decompose it into sub-circuits that have four distinct and modular uses. Finally, we reveal that three distinct models -- Mistral-7B, Gemma-2-9B and Gemma-2-27B -- contain analogous but not identical mechanisms.

We introduce two novel tasks, including PolyFiQA-Easy and PolyFiQA-Expert, the first multilingual financial benchmarks requiring models to perform complex reasoning over mixed-language inputs; and EnglishOCR and SpanishOCR, the first OCR-embedded financial QA tasks challenging models to extract and reason over information from visual-text financial documents. Moreover, we propose a dynamic, difficulty-aware selection mechanism and curate a compact, balanced benchmark rather than simple aggregation existing datasets. Extensive evaluation of 22 state-of-the-art models reveals that even the strongest models, despite their general multimodal and multilingual capabilities, struggle dramatically when faced with complex cross-lingual and multimodal tasks in financial domain. MultiFinBen is publicly released to foster transparent, reproducible, and inclusive progress in financial studies and applications.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. However, their tendency to memorize training data raises concerns regarding privacy, copyright compliance, and security, particularly in cases involving Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Effective machine unlearning techniques are essential to mitigate these risks, yet existing methods remain underdeveloped for LLMs due to their open-ended output space. In this work, we apply the Adaptive Representation Misdirection Unlearning (RMU) technique to unlearn sensitive information from LLMs. Through extensive experiments, we analyze the effects of unlearning across different decoder layers to determine the most effective regions for sensitive information removal. Our technique ranked 4th on the official leaderboard of both 1B parameter and 7B parameter models.

      Traditional ASR metrics like WER and CER fail to capture intelligibility, especially for dysarthric and dysphonic speech, where semantic alignment matters more than exact word matches. ASR systems struggle with these speech types, often producing errors like phoneme repetitions and imprecise consonants, yet the meaning remains clear to human listeners. We identify two key challenges: (1) Existing metrics do not adequately reflect intelligibility, and (2) while LLMs can refine ASR output, their effectiveness in correcting ASR transcripts of dysarthric speech remains underexplored. To address this, we propose a novel metric integrating Natural Language Inference (NLI) scores, semantic similarity, and phonetic similarity. Our ASR evaluation metric achieves a 0.890 correlation with human judgments on Speech Accessibility Project data, surpassing traditional methods and emphasizing the need to prioritize intelligibility over error-based measures.

      Fine-tuning LLMs is both computationally and memory-intensive. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, such as QLoRA and DoRA, reduce the number of trainable parameters and lower memory usage, they do not decrease computational cost. In some cases, they may even slow down fine-tuning. In this paper, we introduce SparseLoRA, a method that accelerates LLM fine-tuning through contextual sparsity. We propose a lightweight, training-free SVD sparsity estimator that dynamically selects a sparse subset of weights for loss and gradient computation. Also, we systematically analyze and address sensitivity across layers, tokens, and training steps. Our experimental results show that SparseLoRA reduces computational cost by up to 2.2 times and a measured speedup of up to 1.6 times while maintaining accuracy across various downstream tasks, including commonsense and arithmetic reasoning, code generation, and instruction following.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new potential for automating documentation-to-code traceability, yet their capabilities remain underexplored. We present a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, and o3-mini) in establishing trace links between various software documentation (including API references and user guides) and source code. We create two novel datasets from two open-source projects (Unity Catalog and Crawl4AI). Through systematic experiments, we assess three key capabilities: (1) trace link identification accuracy, (2) relationship explanation quality, and (3) multi-step chain reconstruction. Results show that the best-performing LLM achieves F1-scores of 79.4% and 80.4% across the two datasets, substantially outperforming our baselines (TF-IDF, BM25, and CodeBERT). While fully correct relationship explanations range from 42.9% to 71.1%, partial accuracy exceeds 97%, indicating that fundamental connections are rarely missed. For multi-step chains, LLMs maintain high endpoint accuracy but vary in capturing precise intermediate links. Error analysis reveals that many false positives stem from naming-based assumptions, phantom links, or overgeneralization of architectural patterns. We demonstrate that task-framing, such as a one-to-many matching strategy, is critical for performance. These findings position LLMs as powerful assistants for trace discovery, but their limitations could necessitate human-in-the-loop tool design and highlight specific error patterns for future research.

      We investigate the challenge of applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to long texts. We propose a theoretical framework that distinguishes the failure modes of long context tasks into three categories: cross-chunk dependence (task noise), confusion that grows with context size (model noise), and the imperfect integration of partial results (aggregator noise). Under this view, we analyze when it is effective to use multi-agent chunking, i.e., dividing a length sequence into smaller chunks and aggregating the processed results of each chunk. Our experiments on tasks such as retrieval, question answering, and summarization confirm both the theoretical analysis and the conditions that favor multi-agent chunking. By exploring superlinear model noise growth with input length, we also explain why, for large inputs, a weaker model configured with chunk-based processing can surpass a more advanced model like GPT4o applied in a single shot. Overall, we present a principled understanding framework and our results highlight a direct pathway to handling long contexts in LLMs with carefully managed chunking and aggregator strategies.

      Modern Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) reduce the cost of customizing large language models (LLMs), yet still require a separate optimization run for every downstream dataset. We introduce \textbf{Drag-and-Drop LLMs (\textit{DnD})}, a prompt-conditioned parameter generator that eliminates per-task training by mapping a handful of unlabeled task prompts directly to LoRA weight updates. A lightweight text encoder distills each prompt batch into condition embeddings, which are then transformed by a cascaded hyper-convolutional decoder into the full set of LoRA matrices. Once trained in a diverse collection of prompt-checkpoint pairs, DnD produces task-specific parameters in seconds, yielding i) up to \textbf{12,000$\times$} lower overhead than full fine-tuning, ii) average gains up to \textbf{30\%} in performance over the strongest training LoRAs on unseen common-sense reasoning, math, coding, and multimodal benchmarks, and iii) robust cross-domain generalization despite never seeing the target data or labels. Our results demonstrate that prompt-conditioned parameter generation is a viable alternative to gradient-based adaptation for rapidly specializing LLMs. Our project is available at \href{https://jerryliang24.github.io/DnD}{https://jerryliang24.github.io/DnD}.

      Although the annotation paradigm based on Large Language Models (LLMs) has made significant breakthroughs in recent years, its actual deployment still has two core bottlenecks: first, the cost of calling commercial APIs in large-scale annotation is very expensive; second, in scenarios that require fine-grained semantic understanding, such as sentiment classification and toxicity classification, the annotation accuracy of LLMs is even lower than that of Small Language Models (SLMs) dedicated to this field. To address these problems, we propose a new paradigm of multi-model cooperative annotation and design a fully automatic annotation framework AutoAnnotator based on this. Specifically, AutoAnnotator consists of two layers. The upper-level meta-controller layer uses the generation and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to select SLMs for annotation, automatically generate annotation code and verify difficult samples; the lower-level task-specialist layer consists of multiple SLMs that perform annotation through multi-model voting. In addition, we use the difficult samples obtained by the secondary review of the meta-controller layer as the reinforcement learning set and fine-tune the SLMs in stages through a continual learning strategy, thereby improving the generalization of SLMs. Extensive experiments show that AutoAnnotator outperforms existing open-source/API LLMs in zero-shot, one-shot, CoT, and majority voting settings. Notably, AutoAnnotator reduces the annotation cost by 74.15% compared to directly annotating with GPT-3.5-turbo, while still improving the accuracy by 6.21%.

      Prompting has become a dominant paradigm for adapting large language models (LLMs). While discrete (textual) prompts are widely used for their interpretability, soft (parameter) prompts have recently gained traction in APIs. This is because they can encode information from more training samples while minimizing the user's token usage, leaving more space in the context window for task-specific input. However, soft prompts are tightly coupled to the LLM they are tuned on, limiting their generalization to other LLMs. This constraint is particularly problematic for efficiency and privacy: (1) tuning prompts on each LLM incurs high computational costs, especially as LLMs continue to grow in size. Additionally, (2) when the LLM is hosted externally, soft prompt tuning often requires sharing private data with the LLM provider. For instance, this is the case with the NVIDIA NeMo API. To address these issues, we propose POST (Privacy Of Soft prompt Transfer), a framework that enables private tuning of soft prompts on a small model and subsequently transfers these prompts to a larger LLM. POST uses knowledge distillation to derive a small model directly from the large LLM to improve prompt transferability, tunes the soft prompt locally, optionally with differential privacy guarantees, and transfers it back to the larger LLM using a small public dataset. Our experiments show that POST reduces computational costs, preserves privacy, and effectively transfers high-utility soft prompts.

      Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) pose significant safety concerns that impede their broader deployment. Recent research in hallucination detection has demonstrated that LLMs' internal representations contain truthfulness hints, which can be harnessed for detector training. However, the performance of these detectors is heavily dependent on the internal representations of predetermined tokens, fluctuating considerably when working on free-form generations with varying lengths and sparse distributions of hallucinated entities. To address this, we propose HaMI, a novel approach that enables robust detection of hallucinations through adaptive selection and learning of critical tokens that are most indicative of hallucinations. We achieve this robustness by an innovative formulation of the Hallucination detection task as Multiple Instance (HaMI) learning over token-level representations within a sequence, thereby facilitating a joint optimisation of token selection and hallucination detection on generation sequences of diverse forms. Comprehensive experimental results on four hallucination benchmarks show that HaMI significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches.

      Language is not only a tool for communication but also a medium for human cognition and reasoning. If, as linguistic relativity suggests, the structure of language shapes cognitive patterns, then large language models (LLMs) trained on human language may also internalize the habitual logical structures embedded in different languages. To examine this hypothesis, we introduce BICAUSE, a structured bilingual dataset for causal reasoning, which includes semantically aligned Chinese and English samples in both forward and reversed causal forms. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) LLMs exhibit typologically aligned attention patterns, focusing more on causes and sentence-initial connectives in Chinese, while showing a more balanced distribution in English. (2) Models internalize language-specific preferences for causal word order and often rigidly apply them to atypical inputs, leading to degraded performance, especially in Chinese. (3) When causal reasoning succeeds, model representations converge toward semantically aligned abstractions across languages, indicating a shared understanding beyond surface form. Overall, these results suggest that LLMs not only mimic surface linguistic forms but also internalize the reasoning biases shaped by language. Rooted in cognitive linguistic theory, this phenomenon is for the first time empirically verified through structural analysis of model internals.

      Large language model-based multi-agent systems have recently gained significant attention due to their potential for complex, collaborative, and intelligent problem-solving capabilities. Existing surveys typically categorize LLM-based multi-agent systems (LLM-MAS) according to their application domains or architectures, overlooking the central role of communication in coordinating agent behaviors and interactions. To address this gap, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of LLM-MAS from a communication-centric perspective. Specifically, we propose a structured framework that integrates system-level communication (architecture, goals, and protocols) with system internal communication (strategies, paradigms, objects, and content), enabling a detailed exploration of how agents interact, negotiate, and achieve collective intelligence. Through an extensive analysis of recent literature, we identify key components in multiple dimensions and summarize their strengths and limitations. In addition, we highlight current challenges, including communication efficiency, security vulnerabilities, inadequate benchmarking, and scalability issues, and outline promising future research directions. This review aims to help researchers and practitioners gain a clear understanding of the communication mechanisms in LLM-MAS, thereby facilitating the design and deployment of robust, scalable, and secure multi-agent systems.

      Large language model-(LLM) based automated program repair (APR) techniques have shown promising results in resolving real-world GitHub issue tasks. Existing APR systems are primarily evaluated in unimodal settings (e.g., SWE-bench). However, these autonomous systems struggle to resolve multimodal problem scenarios (e.g., SWE-bench M) due to limitations in interpreting and leveraging visual information. In multimodal scenarios, LLMs need to rely on visual information in the graphical user interface (GUI) to understand bugs and generate fixes. To bridge this gap, we propose GUIRepair, a cross-modal reasoning approach for resolving multimodal issue scenarios by understanding and capturing visual information. Specifically, GUIRepair integrates two key components, Image2Code and Code2Image, to enhance fault comprehension and patch validation. Image2Code extracts relevant project documents based on the issue report, then applies this domain knowledge to generate the reproduced code responsible for the visual symptoms, effectively translating GUI images into executable context for better fault comprehension. Code2Image replays the visual issue scenario using the reproduced code and captures GUI renderings of the patched program to assess whether the fix visually resolves the issue, providing feedback for patch validation. We evaluate GUIRepair on SWE-bench M, and the approach demonstrates significant effectiveness. When utilizing GPT-4o as the base model, GUIRepair solves 157 instances, outperforming the best open-source baseline by 26 instances. Furthermore, when using o4-mini as the base model, GUIRepair can achieve even better results and solve 175 instances, outperforming the top commercial system by 22 instances. This emphasizes the success of our new perspective on incorporating cross-modal reasoning by understanding and capturing visual information to resolve multimodal issues.

      Large language model (LLM)-powered agents are increasingly used in recommender systems (RSs) to achieve personalized behavior modeling, where the memory mechanism plays a pivotal role in enabling the agents to autonomously explore, learn and self-evolve from real-world interactions. However, this very mechanism, serving as a contextual repository, inherently exposes an attack surface for potential adversarial manipulations. Despite its central role, the robustness of agentic RSs in the face of such threats remains largely underexplored. Previous works suffer from semantic mismatches or rely on static embeddings or pre-defined prompts, all of which hinder their applicability to systems with dynamic memory states. This challenge is exacerbated by the black-box nature of commercial RSs. To tackle the above problems, in this paper, we present the first systematic investigation of memory-based vulnerabilities in LLM-powered recommender agents, revealing their security limitations and guiding efforts to strengthen system resilience and trustworthiness. Specifically, we propose a novel black-box attack framework named DrunkAgent. DrunkAgent crafts semantically meaningful adversarial textual triggers for target item promotions and introduces a series of strategies to maximize the trigger effect by corrupting the memory updates during the interactions. The triggers and strategies are optimized on a surrogate model, enabling DrunkAgent transferable and stealthy. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets across diverse agentic RSs, including collaborative filtering, retrieval augmentation and sequential recommendations, demonstrate the generalizability, transferability and stealthiness of DrunkAgent.

      The Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm has become a pivotal method for solving complex problems with large language models (LLMs). However, its application to domain-specific tasks remains challenging, as LLMs often fail to decompose tasks accurately or execute subtasks effectively. This paper introduces the Re-TASK framework, a novel theoretical model that revisits LLM tasks from capability, skill, and knowledge perspectives, drawing on the principles of Bloom's Taxonomy and Knowledge Space Theory. While CoT provides a workflow-centric perspective on tasks, Re-TASK introduces a Chain-of-Learning (CoL) paradigm that highlights task dependencies on specific capability items, further broken down into their constituent knowledge and skill components. To address CoT failures, we propose a Re-TASK prompting strategy, which strengthens task-relevant capabilities through targeted knowledge injection and skill adaptation. Experiments across diverse domains demonstrate the effectiveness of Re-TASK. In particular, we achieve improvements of 45.00% on Yi-1.5-9B and 24.50% on Llama3-Chinese-8B for legal tasks.

While numerous publicly available preference datasets provide pairwise comparisons of responses, the potential for biases in the resulting reward models remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce novel methods to detect and evaluate prefix bias -- a systematic shift in model preferences triggered by minor variations in query prefixes -- in LLM-based reward models trained on such datasets. We leverage these metrics to reveal significant biases in preference models across racial and gender dimensions. Our comprehensive evaluation spans diverse open-source preference datasets and reward model architectures, demonstrating susceptibility to this kind of bias regardless of the underlying model architecture. Furthermore, we propose a data augmentation strategy to mitigate these biases, showing its effectiveness in reducing the impact of prefix bias.

      Digital watermarking is a promising solution for mitigating some of the risks arising from the misuse of automatically generated text. These approaches either embed non-specific watermarks to allow for the detection of any text generated by a particular sampler, or embed specific keys that allow the identification of the LLM user. However, simultaneously using the same embedding for both detection and user identification leads to a false detection problem, whereby, as user capacity grows, unwatermarked text is increasingly likely to be falsely detected as watermarked. Through theoretical analysis, we identify the underlying causes of this phenomenon. Building on these insights, we propose Dual Watermarking which jointly encodes detection and identification watermarks into generated text, significantly reducing false positives while maintaining high detection accuracy. Our experimental results validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

We introduce TrainVerify, a system for verifiable distributed training of LLMs. Given a deep learning model's logical specification as the ground truth, TrainVerify formally verifies that a distributed parallel execution plan is mathematically equivalent to it. Direct verification is notoriously difficult due to the sheer scale of LLMs which often involves billions of variables and highly intricate computation graphs. Therefore, TrainVerify introduces shape-reduction techniques and a stage-wise parallel verification algorithm that significantly reduces complexity while preserving formal correctness. TrainVerify scales to frontier LLMs, including the successful verification of the Llama3 (405B) and DeepSeek-V3 (671B) training plans.

To satisfy low-latency and high-computation demands, the integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) systems plays a vital role, which offloads computing tasks from terminal devices to nearby UAVs, enabling flexible and resilient service provisions for ground users. To promote the development of LAENets, it is significant to achieve low-carbon multi-UAV-assisted MEC networks. However, several challenges hinder this implementation, including the complexity of multi-dimensional UAV modeling and the difficulty of multi-objective coupled optimization. To this end, this paper proposes a novel Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)-based Large Language Model (LLM) agent framework for model formulation. Specifically, we develop HybridRAG by combining KeywordRAG, VectorRAG, and GraphRAG, empowering LLM agents to efficiently retrieve structural information from expert databases and generate more accurate optimization problems compared with traditional RAG-based LLM agents. After customizing carbon emission optimization problems for multi-UAV-assisted MEC networks, we propose a Double Regularization Diffusion-enhanced Soft Actor-Critic (R\textsuperscript{2}DSAC) algorithm to solve the formulated multi-objective optimization problem. The R\textsuperscript{2}DSAC algorithm incorporates diffusion entropy regularization and action entropy regularization to improve the performance of the diffusion policy. Furthermore, we dynamically mask unimportant neurons in the actor network to reduce the carbon emissions associated with model training. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed HybridRAG-based LLM agent framework and the R\textsuperscript{2}DSAC algorithm.

      This paper presents an evaluation framework for agentic AI systems in mission-critical negotiation contexts, addressing the need for AI agents that can adapt to diverse human operators and stakeholders. Using Sotopia as a simulation testbed, we present two experiments that systematically evaluated how personality traits and AI agent characteristics influence LLM-simulated social negotiation outcomes--a capability essential for a variety of applications involving cross-team coordination and civil-military interactions. Experiment 1 employs causal discovery methods to measure how personality traits impact price bargaining negotiations, through which we found that Agreeableness and Extraversion significantly affect believability, goal achievement, and knowledge acquisition outcomes. Sociocognitive lexical measures extracted from team communications detected fine-grained differences in agents' empathic communication, moral foundations, and opinion patterns, providing actionable insights for agentic AI systems that must operate reliably in high-stakes operational scenarios. Experiment 2 evaluates human-AI job negotiations by manipulating both simulated human personality and AI system characteristics, specifically transparency, competence, adaptability, demonstrating how AI agent trustworthiness impact mission effectiveness. These findings establish a repeatable evaluation methodology for experimenting with AI agent reliability across diverse operator personalities and human-agent team dynamics, directly supporting operational requirements for reliable AI systems. Our work advances the evaluation of agentic AI workflows by moving beyond standard performance metrics to incorporate social dynamics essential for mission success in complex operations.

      Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as personal agents, accessing sensitive user data such as calendars, emails, and medical records. Users currently face a trade-off: They can send private records, many of which are stored in remote databases, to powerful but untrusted LLM providers, increasing their exposure risk. Alternatively, they can run less powerful models locally on trusted devices. We bridge this gap. Our Socratic Chain-of-Thought Reasoning first sends a generic, non-private user query to a powerful, untrusted LLM, which generates a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt and detailed sub-queries without accessing user data. Next, we embed these sub-queries and perform encrypted sub-second semantic search using our Homomorphically Encrypted Vector Database across one million entries of a single user's private data. This represents a realistic scale of personal documents, emails, and records accumulated over years of digital activity. Finally, we feed the CoT prompt and the decrypted records to a local language model and generate the final response. On the LoCoMo long-context QA benchmark, our hybrid framework, combining GPT-4o with a local Llama-3.2-1B model, outperforms using GPT-4o alone by up to 7.1 percentage points. This demonstrates a first step toward systems where tasks are decomposed and split between untrusted strong LLMs and weak local ones, preserving user privacy.

      Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable potential in advancing scientific discovery. However, their capability in the fundamental yet crucial task of reproducing code from research papers, especially in the NLP domain, remains underexplored. This task includes unique complex reasoning challenges in the intellectual synthesis of abstract concepts and the comprehension of code repositories with interdependent files. Motivated by this gap, we present LMR-BENCH, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the capability of LLM agents on code reproduction from Language Modeling Research. It consists of 28 code reproduction tasks derived from 23 research papers published in top-tier NLP venues over the past five years, spanning nine fundamental categories. Models are provided with a research paper, a code repository containing one or more masked functions, and instructions for implementing these functions. We conduct extensive experiments in standard prompting and LLM agent settings with state-of-the-art LLMs, evaluating the accuracy of unit tests and performing LLM-based evaluation of code correctness. Experimental results reveal that even the most advanced models still exhibit persistent limitations in scientific reasoning and code synthesis, highlighting critical gaps in LLM agents' ability to autonomously reproduce scientific research

      With the popularity of large language models (LLMs), undesirable societal problems like misinformation production and academic misconduct have been more severe, making LLM-generated text detection now of unprecedented importance. Although existing methods have made remarkable progress, a new challenge posed by text from privately tuned LLMs remains underexplored. Users could easily possess private LLMs by fine-tuning an open-source one with private corpora, resulting in a significant performance drop of existing detectors in practice. To address this issue, we propose PhantomHunter, an LLM-generated text detector specialized for detecting text from unseen, privately-tuned LLMs. Its family-aware learning framework captures family-level traits shared across the base models and their derivatives, instead of memorizing individual characteristics.

      Phishing websites continue to pose a significant cybersecurity threat, often leveraging deceptive structures, brand impersonation, and social engineering tactics to evade detection. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled improved phishing detection through contextual understanding, most existing approaches rely on single-agent classification facing the risks of hallucination and lack interpretability or robustness. To address these limitations, we propose PhishDebate, a modular multi-agent LLM-based debate framework for phishing website detection. PhishDebate employs four specialized agents to independently analyze different textual aspects of a webpage--URL structure, HTML composition, semantic content, and brand impersonation--under the coordination of a Moderator and a final Judge. Through structured debate and divergent thinking, the framework delivers more accurate and interpretable decisions. Extensive evaluations on commercial LLMs demonstrate that PhishDebate achieves 98.2% recall and 98.2% True Positive Rate (TPR) on a real-world phishing dataset, and outperforms single-agent and Chain of Thought (CoT) baselines. Additionally, its modular design allows agent-level configurability, enabling adaptation to varying resource and application requirements.

      Although Rust ensures memory safety by default, it also permits the use of unsafe code, which can introduce memory safety vulnerabilities if misused. Unfortunately, existing tools for detecting memory bugs in Rust typically exhibit limited detection capabilities, inadequately handle Rust-specific types, or rely heavily on manual intervention. To address these limitations, we present deepSURF, a tool that integrates static analysis with Large Language Model (LLM)-guided fuzzing harness generation to effectively identify memory safety vulnerabilities in Rust libraries, specifically targeting unsafe code. deepSURF introduces a novel approach for handling generics by substituting them with custom types and generating tailored implementations for the required traits, enabling the fuzzer to simulate user-defined behaviors within the fuzzed library. Additionally, deepSURF employs LLMs to augment fuzzing harnesses dynamically, facilitating exploration of complex API interactions and significantly increasing the likelihood of exposing memory safety vulnerabilities. We evaluated deepSURF on 27 real-world Rust crates, successfully rediscovering 20 known memory safety bugs and uncovering 6 previously unknown vulnerabilities, demonstrating clear improvements over state-of-the-art tools.

      Embedding-Based Retrieval (EBR) is an important technique in modern search engines, enabling semantic match between search queries and relevant results. However, search logging data on platforms like Facebook Marketplace lacks the diversity and details needed for effective EBR model training, limiting the models' ability to capture nuanced search patterns. To address this challenge, we propose Aug2Search, an EBR-based framework leveraging synthetic data generated by Generative AI (GenAI) models, in a multimodal and multitask approach to optimize query-product relevance. This paper investigates the capabilities of GenAI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), in generating high-quality synthetic data, and analyzing its impact on enhancing EBR models. We conducted experiments using eight Llama models and 100 million data points from Facebook Marketplace logs. Our synthetic data generation follows three strategies: (1) generate queries, (2) enhance product listings, and (3) generate queries from enhanced listings. We train EBR models on three different datasets: sampled engagement data or original data ((e.g., "Click" and "Listing Interactions")), synthetic data, and a mixture of both engagement and synthetic data to assess their performance across various training sets. Our findings underscore the robustness of Llama models in producing synthetic queries and listings with high coherence, relevance, and diversity, while maintaining low levels of hallucination. Aug2Search achieves an improvement of up to 4% in ROC_AUC with 100 million synthetic data samples, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Moreover, our experiments reveal that with the same volume of training data, models trained exclusively on synthetic data often outperform those trained on original data only or a mixture of original and synthetic data.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise as decision-makers in dynamic settings, but their stateless nature necessitates creating a natural language representation of history. We present a unifying framework for systematically constructing natural language "state" representations for prompting LLM agents in repeated multi-agent games. Previous work on games with LLM agents has taken an ad hoc approach to encoding game history, which not only obscures the impact of state representation on agents' behavior, but also limits comparability between studies. Our framework addresses these gaps by characterizing methods of state representation along three axes: action informativeness (i.e., the extent to which the state representation captures actions played); reward informativeness (i.e., the extent to which the state representation describes rewards obtained); and prompting style (or natural language compression, i.e., the extent to which the full text history is summarized). We apply this framework to a dynamic selfish routing game, chosen because it admits a simple equilibrium both in theory and in human subject experiments \cite{rapoport_choice_2009}. Despite the game's relative simplicity, we find that there are key dependencies of LLM agent behavior on the natural language state representation. In particular, we observe that representations which provide agents with (1) summarized, rather than complete, natural language representations of past history; (2) information about regrets, rather than raw payoffs; and (3) limited information about others' actions lead to behavior that more closely matches game theoretic equilibrium predictions, and with more stable game play by the agents. By contrast, other representations can exhibit either large deviations from equilibrium, higher variation in dynamic game play over time, or both.

      The rapid emergence of diverse large language models (LLMs) has spurred the development of LLM routers that assign user queries to the most suitable model. However, existing LLM routers typically perform a single-round, one-to-one mapping (\textit{i.e.}, assigning each query to a single model in isolation), which limits their capability to tackle complex tasks that demand the complementary strengths of multiple LLMs. In this paper, we present \textbf{Router-R1}, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework that formulates multi-LLM routing and aggregation as a sequential decision process. Router-R1 instantiates the router itself as a capable LLM, leveraging its reasoning ability to interleave "think" actions (internal deliberation) with "route" actions (dynamic model invocation), and integrates each response into its evolving context. To facilitate learning, we employ a lightweight rule-based reward comprising format rewards, final outcome rewards, and a novel cost reward for optimizing the balance between performance and cost, opening a pathway toward enhancing performance-cost trade-offs via RL. Router-R1 also conditions only on simple model descriptors such as pricing, latency, and example performance, enabling strong generalization to unseen model selection. Experiments on seven general and multi-hop QA benchmarks show that Router-R1 outperforms several strong baselines, achieving superior performance while maintaining robust generalization and cost management.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable in real-world applications. However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning - even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations. The code is available at github.com/VITA-Group/LoX.

The integration of AI components within the computational infrastructure of FA labs has the potential to automate a variety of tasks, including the detection of non-conformities in images, the retrieval of analogous cases from diverse data sources, and the generation of reports from annotated images. However, as the number of deployed AI models increases, the challenge lies in orchestrating these components into cohesive and efficient workflows that seamlessly integrate with the FA process.

      Generating grounded and trustworthy responses remains a key challenge for large language models (LLMs). While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with citation-based grounding holds promise, instruction-tuned models frequently fail even in straightforward scenarios: missing explicitly stated answers, citing incorrectly, or refusing when evidence is available. In this work, we explore how reinforcement learning (RL) and internal reasoning can enhance grounding in LLMs. We use the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) method to train models using verifiable outcome-based rewards targeting answer correctness, citation sufficiency, and refusal quality, without requiring gold reasoning traces or expensive annotations. Through comprehensive experiments across ASQA, QAMPARI, ELI5, and ExpertQA we show that reasoning-augmented models significantly outperform instruction-only variants, especially in handling unanswerable queries and generating well-cited responses. A two-stage training setup, first optimizing answer and citation behavior and then refusal, further improves grounding by stabilizing the learning signal. Additionally, we revisit instruction tuning via GPT-4 distillation and find that combining it with GRPO enhances performance on long-form, generative QA tasks. Overall, our findings highlight the value of reasoning, stage-wise optimization, and outcome-driven RL for building more verifiable and reliable LLMs.

      Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a common strategy for updating large language model (LLM) responses with current, external information. However, models may still rely on memorized training data, bypass the retrieved evidence, and produce contaminated outputs. We introduce Retrieval-Path Contamination Scoring (RePCS), a diagnostic method that detects such behavior without requiring model access or retraining. RePCS compares two inference paths: (i) a parametric path using only the query, and (ii) a retrieval-augmented path using both the query and retrieved context by computing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between their output distributions. A low divergence suggests that the retrieved context had minimal impact, indicating potential memorization. This procedure is model-agnostic, requires no gradient or internal state access, and adds only a single additional forward pass. We further derive PAC-style guarantees that link the KL threshold to user-defined false positive and false negative rates. On the Prompt-WNQA benchmark, RePCS achieves a ROC-AUC of 0.918. This result outperforms the strongest prior method by 6.5 percentage points while keeping latency overhead below 4.7% on an NVIDIA T4 GPU. RePCS offers a lightweight, black-box safeguard to verify whether a RAG system meaningfully leverages retrieval, making it especially valuable in safety-critical applications.

      The rise of reinforcement learning (RL) in critical real-world applications demands a fundamental rethinking of privacy in AI systems. Traditional privacy frameworks, designed to protect isolated data points, fall short for sequential decision-making systems where sensitive information emerges from temporal patterns, behavioral strategies, and collaborative dynamics. Modern RL paradigms, such as federated RL (FedRL) and RL with human feedback (RLHF) in large language models (LLMs), exacerbate these challenges by introducing complex, interactive, and context-dependent learning environments that traditional methods do not address. In this position paper, we argue for a new privacy paradigm built on four core principles: multi-scale protection, behavioral pattern protection, collaborative privacy preservation, and context-aware adaptation. These principles expose inherent tensions between privacy, utility, and interpretability that must be navigated as RL systems become more pervasive in high-stakes domains like healthcare, autonomous vehicles, and decision support systems powered by LLMs. To tackle these challenges, we call for the development of new theoretical frameworks, practical mechanisms, and rigorous evaluation methodologies that collectively enable effective privacy protection in sequential decision-making systems.

      Training LLMs on decentralized and wimpy computation nodes, e.g., multiple on-spot instances, lowers the training cost and enables model democratization. The inevitable challenge here is the churn of nodes due to failures and the operator's scheduling policies, leading to losing a stage - a part of the model. The conventional approaches to recover from failures are to either use checkpointing, where periodically a copy of the entire model is sent to an additional storage, or redundant computation. These approaches yield significant communication and/or computation overhead even in non-failure cases and scale poorly in settings with large models. In this paper, we propose, CheckFree, an efficient recovery method where a failing stage is substituted by a weighted average of the closest neighboring stages. In contrast to the state of the art, CheckFree requires no additional computation or storage. However, because of the nature of averaging neighbouring stages, it can only recover failures of intermediate stages. We further extend our method to CheckFree+ with out-of-order pipeline execution to tolerate crashes of the first and last stages. Thanks to out-of-order pipelining, behaviour of those stages is mimicked by their neighboring ones, which allows CheckFree+ to recover them by simply copying the weights from the immediate neighbour. To be able to recover the (de)embedding layers, CheckFree+ copies those layers to the neighboring stages, which requires relatively small storage overhead. We extensively evaluate our method on LLaMa models of model sizes from 124M to 1.5B with varying failure frequencies. In the case of low and medium failure rates (5-10%), CheckFree and CheckFree+ outperform both checkpointing and redundant computation in terms of convergence in wall-clock time by over 12%. Both of our proposals can be run via our code available at: https://github.com/gensyn-ai/CheckFree.

      Documenting code snippets is essential to pinpoint key areas where both developers and users should pay attention. Examples include usage examples and other Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which are especially important for third-party libraries. With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), the key goal is to investigate the kinds of description developers commonly use and evaluate how well an LLM, in this case Llama, can support description generation. We use NPM Code Snippets, consisting of 185,412 packages with 1,024,579 code snippets. From there, we use 400 code snippets (and their descriptions) as samples. First, our manual classification found that the majority of original descriptions (55.5%) highlight example-based usage. This finding emphasizes the importance of clear documentation, as some descriptions lacked sufficient detail to convey intent. Second, the LLM correctly identified the majority of original descriptions as "Example" (79.75%), which is identical to our manual finding, showing a propensity for generalization. Third, compared to the originals, the produced description had an average similarity score of 0.7173, suggesting relevance but room for improvement. Scores below 0.9 indicate some irrelevance. Our results show that depending on the task of the code snippet, the intention of the document may differ from being instructions for usage, installations, or descriptive learning examples for any user of a library.

(2) an adaptive collaboration engine that dynamically selects heterogeneous LLM combinations and interaction modes based on task characteristics. (3) agent organization optimization strategies combining divide-and-conquer approaches for efficient problem decomposition. Extensive experiments demonstrate AgentGroupChat-V2's superior performance across diverse domains, achieving 91.50% accuracy on GSM8K (exceeding the best baseline by 5.6 percentage points), 30.4% accuracy on competition-level AIME (nearly doubling other methods), and 79.20% pass@1 on HumanEval.

To address these challenges, we present FrontendBench, a benchmark co-developed by humans and LLMs. FrontendBench categorizes tasks based on code functionality and incorporates interactive test scenarios, enabling a more comprehensive and practical evaluation of front-end code generation capabilities. The benchmark comprises 148 meticulously crafted prompt-test case pairs spanning five levels of web components, from basic UI elements to complex interactive features. Each task reflects realistic front-end development challenges. Furthermore, we introduce an automatic evaluation framework that executes generated code within a sandbox environment and assesses outcomes using predefined test scripts. This framework achieves a 90.54% agreement rate with expert human evaluations, demonstrating high reliability. We benchmark several state-of-the-art LLMs on FrontendBench and observe substantial performance disparities in handling real-world front-end tasks. These results highlight FrontendBench as a reliable and scalable benchmark, supporting consistent multimodal evaluation and providing a robust foundation for future research in front-end code generation. Our data and code will be released soon.

      The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers potential solutions to address problems such as shortage of medical resources and low diagnostic consistency in psychiatric clinical practice. Despite this potential, a robust and comprehensive benchmarking framework to assess the efficacy of LLMs in authentic psychiatric clinical environments is absent. This has impeded the advancement of specialized LLMs tailored to psychiatric applications. In response to this gap, by incorporating clinical demands in psychiatry and clinical data, we proposed a benchmarking system, PsychBench, to evaluate the practical performance of LLMs in psychiatric clinical settings. We conducted a comprehensive quantitative evaluation of 16 LLMs using PsychBench, and investigated the impact of prompt design, chain-of-thought reasoning, input text length, and domain-specific knowledge fine-tuning on model performance. Through detailed error analysis, we identified strengths and potential limitations of the existing models and suggested directions for improvement. Subsequently, a clinical reader study involving 60 psychiatrists of varying seniority was conducted to further explore the practical benefits of existing LLMs as supportive tools for psychiatrists of varying seniority. Through the quantitative and reader evaluation, we show that while existing models demonstrate significant potential, they are not yet adequate as decision-making tools in psychiatric clinical practice. The reader study further indicates that, as an auxiliary tool, LLM could provide particularly notable support for junior psychiatrists, effectively enhancing their work efficiency and overall clinical quality. To promote research in this area, we will make the dataset and evaluation framework publicly available, with the hope of advancing the application of LLMs in psychiatric clinical settings.

      With LLM usage rapidly increasing, their vulnerability to jailbreaks that create harmful outputs are a major security risk. As new jailbreaking strategies emerge and models are changed by fine-tuning, continuous testing for security vulnerabilities is necessary. Existing Red Teaming methods fall short in cost efficiency, attack success rate, attack diversity, or extensibility as new attack types emerge. We address these challenges with Modular And Diverse Malicious Attack MiXtures (MAD-MAX) for Automated LLM Red Teaming. MAD-MAX uses automatic assignment of attack strategies into relevant attack clusters, chooses the most relevant clusters for a malicious goal, and then combines strategies from the selected clusters to achieve diverse novel attacks with high attack success rates. MAD-MAX further merges promising attacks together at each iteration of Red Teaming to boost performance and introduces a similarity filter to prune out similar attacks for increased cost efficiency. The MAD-MAX approach is designed to be easily extensible with newly discovered attack strategies and outperforms the prominent Red Teaming method Tree of Attacks with Pruning (TAP) significantly in terms of Attack Success Rate (ASR) and queries needed to achieve jailbreaks. MAD-MAX jailbreaks 97% of malicious goals in our benchmarks on GPT-4o and Gemini-Pro compared to TAP with 66%. MAD-MAX does so with only 10.9 average queries to the target LLM compared to TAP with 23.3. WARNING: This paper contains contents which are offensive in nature.

      Recent advances in LLMs have greatly improved general-domain NLP tasks. Yet, their adoption in critical domains, such as clinical trial recruitment, remains limited. As trials are designed in natural language and patient data is represented as both structured and unstructured text, the task of matching trials and patients benefits from knowledge aggregation and reasoning abilities of LLMs. Classical approaches are trial-specific and LLMs with their ability to consolidate distributed knowledge hold the potential to build a more general solution. Yet recent applications of LLM-assisted methods rely on proprietary models and weak evaluation benchmarks. In this survey, we are the first to analyze the task of trial-patient matching and contextualize emerging LLM-based approaches in clinical trial recruitment. We critically examine existing benchmarks, approaches and evaluation frameworks, the challenges to adopting LLM technologies in clinical research and exciting future directions.

      Robotic assembly tasks remain an open challenge due to their long horizon nature and complex part relations. Behavior trees (BTs) are increasingly used in robot task planning for their modularity and flexibility, but creating them manually can be effort-intensive. Large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied to robotic task planning for generating action sequences, yet their ability to generate BTs has not been fully investigated. To this end, we propose LLM-as-BT-Planner, a novel framework that leverages LLMs for BT generation in robotic assembly task planning. Four in-context learning methods are introduced to utilize the natural language processing and inference capabilities of LLMs for producing task plans in BT format, reducing manual effort while ensuring robustness and comprehensibility. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of fine-tuned smaller LLMs on the same tasks. Experiments in both simulated and real-world settings demonstrate that our framework enhances LLMs' ability to generate BTs, improving success rate through in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning.

      Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly evolved, approaching Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) while benefiting from large-scale reinforcement learning to enhance Human Alignment (HA) and Reasoning. Recent reward-based optimization algorithms, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have achieved significant performance on reasoning tasks, whereas preference-based optimization algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) significantly improve the performance of LLMs on human alignment. However, despite the strong performance of reward-based optimization methods in alignment tasks , they remain vulnerable to reward hacking. Furthermore, preference-based algorithms (such as Online DPO) haven't yet matched the performance of reward-based optimization algorithms (like PPO) on reasoning tasks, making their exploration in this specific area still a worthwhile pursuit. Motivated by these challenges, we propose the Trust Region Preference Approximation (TRPA) algorithm, which integrates rule-based optimization with preference-based optimization for reasoning tasks. As a preference-based algorithm, TRPA naturally eliminates the reward hacking issue. TRPA constructs preference levels using predefined rules, forms corresponding preference pairs, and leverages a novel optimization algorithm for RL training with a theoretical monotonic improvement guarantee. Experimental results demonstrate that TRPA not only achieves competitive performance on reasoning tasks but also exhibits robust stability.

      We explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated assessment of open-text student reflections and prediction of academic performance. Traditional methods for evaluating reflections are time-consuming and may not scale effectively in educational settings. In this work, we employ LLMs to transform student reflections into quantitative scores using two assessment strategies (single-agent and multi-agent) and two prompting techniques (zero-shot and few-shot). Our experiments, conducted on a dataset of 5,278 reflections from 377 students over three academic terms, demonstrate that the single-agent with few-shot strategy achieves the highest match rate with human evaluations. Furthermore, models utilizing LLM-assessed reflection scores outperform baselines in both at-risk student identification and grade prediction tasks. These findings suggest that LLMs can effectively automate reflection assessment, reduce educators' workload, and enable timely support for students who may need additional assistance. Our work emphasizes the potential of integrating advanced generative AI technologies into educational practices to enhance student engagement and academic success.

      Human vision is dynamic and continuous. However, in video understanding with multimodal large language models (LLMs), existing methods primarily rely on static features extracted from images sampled at a fixed low frame rate of frame-per-second (FPS) $\leqslant$2, leading to critical visual information loss. In this paper, we introduce F-16, the first multimodal LLM designed for high-frame-rate video understanding. By increasing the frame rate to 16 FPS and compressing visual tokens within each 1-second clip, F-16 efficiently captures dynamic visual features while preserving key semantic information. Experimental results demonstrate that higher frame rates considerably enhance video understanding across multiple benchmarks, providing a new approach to improving video LLMs beyond scaling model size or training data. F-16 achieves state-of-the-art performance among 7-billion-parameter video LLMs on both general and fine-grained video understanding benchmarks, such as Video-MME and TemporalBench. Furthermore, F-16 excels in complex spatiotemporal tasks, including high-speed sports analysis (\textit{e.g.}, basketball, football, gymnastics, and diving), outperforming SOTA proprietary visual models like GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-pro. Additionally, we introduce a novel decoding method for F-16 that enables highly efficient low-frame-rate inference without requiring model retraining.

      Open-ended question answering (QA) is a key task for evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Compared to closed-ended QA, it demands longer answer statements, more nuanced reasoning processes, and diverse expressions, making refined and interpretable automatic evaluation both crucial and challenging. Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore struggle to capture semantic similarities due to different patterns between model responses and reference answers. Current LLM-based evaluation approaches, such as pairwise or listwise comparisons of candidate answers, lack intuitive interpretability. While pointwise scoring of each response provides some descriptions, it fails to adapt across different question contents. Most notably, existing methods overlook the distinction between factoid and non-factoid questions. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{MinosEval}, a novel evaluation method that first distinguishes open-ended questions and then ranks candidate answers using different evaluation strategies. For factoid questions, it applies an adaptive key-point scoring strategy, while for non-factoid questions, it uses an instance-aware listwise ranking strategy. Experiments on multiple open-ended QA datasets, including self-built ones with more candidate responses to complement community resources, show that MinosEval better aligns with human annotations and offers more interpretable results.

      Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) trained with Long Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) reasoning have demonstrated remarkable cross-domain generalization capabilities. However, the underlying mechanisms supporting such transfer remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that cross-domain generalization arises from shared abstract reasoning prototypes -- fundamental reasoning patterns that capture the essence of problems across domains. These prototypes minimize the nuances of the representation, revealing that seemingly diverse tasks are grounded in shared reasoning structures.Based on this hypothesis, we propose ProtoReasoning, a framework that enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs by leveraging scalable and verifiable prototypical representations (Prolog for logical reasoning, PDDL for planning).ProtoReasoning features: (1) an automated prototype construction pipeline that transforms problems into corresponding prototype representations; (2) a comprehensive verification system providing reliable feedback through Prolog/PDDL interpreters; (3) the scalability to synthesize problems arbitrarily within prototype space while ensuring correctness. Extensive experiments show that ProtoReasoning achieves 4.7% improvement over baseline models on logical reasoning (Enigmata-Eval), 6.3% improvement on planning tasks, 4.0% improvement on general reasoning (MMLU) and 1.0% on mathematics (AIME24). Significantly, our ablation studies confirm that learning in prototype space also demonstrates enhanced generalization to structurally similar problems compared to training solely on natural language representations, validating our hypothesis that reasoning prototypes serve as the foundation for generalizable reasoning in large language models.

      Heuristic algorithms play a vital role in solving combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, yet traditional designs depend heavily on manual expertise and struggle to generalize across diverse instances. We introduce \textbf{HeurAgenix}, a two-stage hyper-heuristic framework powered by large language models (LLMs) that first evolves heuristics and then selects among them automatically. In the heuristic evolution phase, HeurAgenix leverages an LLM to compare seed heuristic solutions with higher-quality solutions and extract reusable evolution strategies. During problem solving, it dynamically picks the most promising heuristic for each problem state, guided by the LLM's perception ability. For flexibility, this selector can be either a state-of-the-art LLM or a fine-tuned lightweight model with lower inference cost. To mitigate the scarcity of reliable supervision caused by CO complexity, we fine-tune the lightweight heuristic selector with a dual-reward mechanism that jointly exploits singals from selection preferences and state perception, enabling robust selection under noisy annotations. Extensive experiments on canonical benchmarks show that HeurAgenix not only outperforms existing LLM-based hyper-heuristics but also matches or exceeds specialized solvers.

Next, we categorize mainstream jailbreak techniques from both the attack impact and visibility perspectives, and provide a comprehensive analysis of representative attack methods, related datasets, and evaluation metrics. On the defense side, we organize existing strategies based on response timing and technical approach, offering a structured understanding of their applicability and implementation. Furthermore, we identify key limitations in existing surveys, such as insufficient attention to agent-specific security issues, the absence of a clear taxonomy for hybrid jailbreak methods, a lack of detailed analysis of experimental setups, and outdated coverage of recent advancements.

However, ML-assisted debugging critically depends on diverse and scalable bug datasets, which existing manual or automated bug insertion methods fail to reliably produce. We introduce BugGen, a first of its kind, fully autonomous, multi-agent pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically generate, insert, and validate realistic functional bugs in RTL. BugGen partitions modules, selects mutation targets via a closed-loop agentic architecture, and employs iterative refinement and rollback mechanisms to ensure syntactic correctness and functional detectability. Evaluated across five OpenTitan IP blocks, BugGen produced 500 unique bugs with 94% functional accuracy and achieved a throughput of 17.7 validated bugs per hour-over five times faster than typical manual expert insertion. Additionally, BugGen identified 104 previously undetected bugs in OpenTitan regressions, highlighting its utility in exposing verification coverage gaps. Compared against Certitude, BugGen demonstrated over twice the syntactic accuracy, deeper exposure of testbench blind spots, and more functionally meaningful and complex bug scenarios. Furthermore, when these BugGen-generated datasets were employed to train ML-based failure triage models, we achieved high classification accuracy (88.1%-93.2%) across different IP blocks, confirming the practical utility and realism of generated bugs. BugGen thus provides a scalable solution for generating high-quality bug datasets, significantly enhancing verification efficiency and ML-assisted debugging.

In this paper, we design an large language model (LLM) agent for automatic hyper-parameters-tuning, where an iterative framework and model context protocol (MCP) are applied. In particular, the LLM agent is first setup via a profile, which specifies the mission, background, and output format. Then, the LLM agent is driven by the prompt requirement, and iteratively invokes WS-PSO-CM algorithm for exploration. Finally, the LLM agent autonomously terminates the loop and returns a set of hyper-parameters. Our experiment results show that the minimal sum-rate achieved by hyper-parameters generated via our LLM agent is significantly higher than those by both human heuristics and random generation methods. This indicates that an LLM agent with PSO knowledge and WS-PSO-CM algorithm background is useful in finding high-performance hyper-parameters.

      Large Language Models are increasingly being deployed in datacenters. Serving these models requires careful memory management, as their memory usage includes static weights, dynamic activations, and key-value caches. While static weights are constant and predictable, dynamic components such as activations and KV caches change frequently during runtime, presenting significant challenges for efficient memory management. Modern LLM serving systems typically handle runtime memory and KV caches at distinct abstraction levels: runtime memory management relies on static tensor abstractions, whereas KV caches utilize a page table-based virtualization layer built on top of the tensor abstraction. This virtualization dynamically manages KV caches to mitigate memory fragmentation. However, this dual-level approach fundamentally isolates runtime memory and KV cache management, resulting in suboptimal memory utilization under dynamic workloads, which can lead to a nearly 20% drop in throughput. To address these limitations, we propose eLLM, an elastic memory management framework inspired by the classical memory ballooning mechanism in operating systems. The core components of eLLM include: (1) Virtual Tensor Abstraction, which decouples the virtual address space of tensors from the physical GPU memory, creating a unified and flexible memory pool; (2) an Elastic Memory Mechanism that dynamically adjusts memory allocation through runtime memory inflation and deflation, leveraging CPU memory as an extensible buffer; and (3) a Lightweight Scheduling Strategy employing SLO-aware policies to optimize memory utilization and effectively balance performance trade-offs under stringent SLO constraints. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that eLLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art systems, 2.32x higher decoding throughput, and supporting 3x larger batch sizes for 128K-token inputs.

      Advancements in deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) have positioned it as a promising approach for decision-making in cooperative games. However, it still remains challenging for MARL agents to learn cooperative strategies for some game environments. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated emergent reasoning capabilities, making them promising candidates for enhancing coordination among the agents. However, due to the model size of LLMs, it can be expensive to frequently infer LLMs for actions that agents can take. In this work, we propose You Only LLM Once for MARL (YOLO-MARL), a novel framework that leverages the high-level task planning capabilities of LLMs to improve the policy learning process of multi-agents in cooperative games. Notably, for each game environment, YOLO-MARL only requires one time interaction with LLMs in the proposed strategy generation, state interpretation and planning function generation modules, before the MARL policy training process. This avoids the ongoing costs and computational time associated with frequent LLMs API calls during training. Moreover, trained decentralized policies based on normal-sized neural networks operate independently of the LLM. We evaluate our method across two different environments and demonstrate that YOLO-MARL outperforms traditional MARL algorithms.

In this work, we model the o2m property of OD in LLMs by decomposing OD generation into two key tasks: Multi-Response Generation (MRG) and Preference-based Selection (PS), which entail generating a set of n semantically and lexically diverse high-quality responses for a given dialogue context, followed by selecting a single response based on human preference, respectively. To facilitate MRG and PS, we introduce o2mDial, a dialogue corpus explicitly designed to capture the o2m property by featuring multiple plausible responses for each context. Leveraging o2mDial, we propose new in-context learning and instruction-tuning strategies, as well as novel evaluation metrics for MRG, alongside a model-based approach for PS. Empirical results demonstrate that applying the proposed two-stage framework to smaller LLMs for OD generation enhances overall response diversity while maintaining contextual coherence, improving response quality by up to 90%, bringing them closer to the performance of larger models.

      Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated immense utility across various industries. However, as LLMs advance, the risk of harmful outputs increases due to incorrect or malicious instruction prompts. While current methods effectively address jailbreak risks, they share common limitations: 1) Judging harmful responses from the prefill-level lacks utilization of the model's decoding outputs, leading to relatively lower effectiveness and robustness. 2) Rejecting potentially harmful responses based on a single evaluation can significantly impair the model's helpfulness.This paper examines the LLMs' capability to recognize harmful outputs, revealing and quantifying their proficiency in assessing the danger of previous tokens. Motivated by pilot experiment results, we design a robust defense mechanism at the decoding level. Our novel decoder-oriented, step-by-step defense architecture corrects harmful queries directly rather than rejecting them outright. We introduce speculative decoding to enhance usability and facilitate deployment to boost secure decoding speed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach improves model security without compromising reasoning speed. Notably, our method leverages the model's ability to discern hazardous information, maintaining its helpfulness compared to existing methods.

      As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in the real world, the ability to ``unlearn'', or remove specific pieces of knowledge post hoc, has become essential for a variety of reasons ranging from privacy regulations to correcting outdated or harmful content. Prior work has proposed unlearning benchmarks and algorithms, and has typically assumed that the training process and the target model are fixed. In this work, we empirically investigate how learning-time choices in knowledge encoding impact the effectiveness of unlearning factual knowledge. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1) learning with paraphrased descriptions improves unlearning performance and (2) unlearning individual piece of knowledge from a chunk of text is challenging. Our results suggest that learning-time knowledge encoding may play a central role in enabling reliable post-hoc unlearning.

      The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought impressive advancements across various tasks. However, despite these achievements, LLMs still pose inherent safety risks, especially in the context of jailbreak attacks. Most existing jailbreak methods follow an input-level manipulation paradigm to bypass safety mechanisms. Yet, as alignment techniques improve, such attacks are becoming increasingly detectable. In this work, we identify an underexplored threat vector: the model's internal reasoning process, which can be manipulated to elicit harmful outputs in a more stealthy way. To explore this overlooked attack surface, we propose a novel black-box jailbreak attack method, Analyzing-based Jailbreak (ABJ). ABJ comprises two independent attack paths: textual and visual reasoning attacks, which exploit the model's multimodal reasoning capabilities to bypass safety mechanisms, comprehensively exposing vulnerabilities in its reasoning chain. We conduct extensive experiments on ABJ across various open-source and closed-source LLMs, VLMs, and RLMs. In particular, ABJ achieves high attack success rate (ASR) (82.1% on GPT-4o-2024-11-20) with exceptional attack efficiency (AE) among all target models, showcasing its remarkable attack effectiveness, transferability, and efficiency. Our work reveals a new type of safety risk and highlights the urgent need to mitigate implicit vulnerabilities in the model's reasoning process.

      As the complexity of integrated circuit designs continues to escalate, the functional verification becomes increasingly challenging. Reference models, critical for accelerating the verification process, are themselves becoming more intricate and time-consuming to develop. Despite the promise shown by large language models (LLMs) in code programming, effectively generating complex reference models remains a significant hurdle. To address these challenges, we introduce ChatModel, the first LLM-aided agile reference model generation and verification platform. ChatModel streamlines the transition from design specifications to fully functional reference models by integrating design standardization and hierarchical agile modeling. Employing a building-block generation strategy, it not only enhances the design capabilities of LLMs for reference models but also significantly boosts verification efficiency. We evaluated ChatModel on 300 designs of varying complexity, demonstrating substantial improvements in both efficiency and quality of reference model generation. ChatModel achieved a peak performance improvement of 55.02% compared to alternative methods, with notable enhancements in generation stability, and delivered a 9.18x increase in its capacity to produce reference model designs. Furthermore, it accelerated the iterative process of reference model design and validation by an average of 5.90x compared to traditional approaches. These results highlight the potential of ChatModel to significantly advance the automation of reference model generation and validation.

      Negation is a fundamental linguistic phenomenon that poses persistent challenges for Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in tasks requiring deep semantic understanding. Existing benchmarks often treat negation as a side case within broader tasks like natural language inference, resulting in a lack of benchmarks that exclusively target negation understanding. In this work, we introduce Thunder-NUBench, a novel benchmark explicitly designed to assess sentence-level negation understanding in LLMs. Thunder-NUBench goes beyond surface-level cue detection by contrasting standard negation with structurally diverse alternatives such as local negation, contradiction, and paraphrase. The benchmark consists of manually curated sentence-negation pairs and a multiple-choice dataset that enables in-depth evaluation of models' negation understanding.
