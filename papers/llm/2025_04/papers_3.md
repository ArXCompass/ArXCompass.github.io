      Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence, driving advancements in machine translation, summarization, and conversational agents. However, their increasing integration into critical societal domains has raised concerns about embedded biases, which can perpetuate stereotypes and compromise fairness. These biases stem from various sources, including historical inequalities in training data, linguistic imbalances, and adversarial manipulation. Despite mitigation efforts, recent studies indicate that LLMs remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks designed to elicit biased responses. This work proposes a scalable benchmarking framework to evaluate LLM robustness against adversarial bias elicitation. Our methodology involves (i) systematically probing models with a multi-task approach targeting biases across various sociocultural dimensions, (ii) quantifying robustness through safety scores using an LLM-as-a-Judge approach for automated assessment of model responses, and (iii) employing jailbreak techniques to investigate vulnerabilities in safety mechanisms. Our analysis examines prevalent biases in both small and large state-of-the-art models and their impact on model safety. Additionally, we assess the safety of domain-specific models fine-tuned for critical fields, such as medicine. Finally, we release a curated dataset of bias-related prompts, CLEAR-Bias, to facilitate systematic vulnerability benchmarking. Our findings reveal critical trade-offs between model size and safety, aiding the development of fairer and more robust future language models.

      Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) pose significant safety concerns that impede their broader deployment. Recent research in hallucination detection has demonstrated that LLMs' internal representations contain truthfulness hints, which can be harnessed for detector training. However, the performance of these detectors is heavily dependent on the internal representations of predetermined tokens, fluctuating considerably when working on free-form generations with varying lengths and sparse distributions of hallucinated entities. To address this, we propose HaMI, a novel approach that enables robust detection of hallucinations through adaptive selection and learning of critical tokens that are most indicative of hallucinations. We achieve this robustness by an innovative formulation of the Hallucination detection task as Multiple Instance (HaMI) learning over token-level representations within a sequence, thereby facilitating a joint optimisation of token selection and hallucination detection on generation sequences of diverse forms. Comprehensive experimental results on four hallucination benchmarks show that HaMI significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed human-computer interaction by enabling natural language-based communication with AI-powered chatbots. These models are designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing users to articulate requests with minimal effort. However, despite their accessibility, studies reveal that users often struggle with effective prompting, resulting in inefficient responses. Existing research has highlighted both the limitations of LLMs in interpreting vague or poorly structured prompts and the difficulties users face in crafting precise queries. This study investigates learner-AI interactions through an educational experiment in which participants receive structured guidance on effective prompting. We introduce and compare three types of prompting guidelines: a task-specific framework developed through a structured methodology and two baseline approaches. To assess user behavior and prompting efficacy, we analyze a dataset of 642 interactions from 107 users. Using Von NeuMidas, an extended pragmatic annotation schema for LLM interaction analysis, we categorize common prompting errors and identify recurring behavioral patterns. We then evaluate the impact of different guidelines by examining changes in user behavior, adherence to prompting strategies, and the overall quality of AI-generated responses. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of how users engage with LLMs and the role of structured prompting guidance in enhancing AI-assisted communication. By comparing different instructional frameworks, we offer insights into more effective approaches for improving user competency in AI interactions, with implications for AI literacy, chatbot usability, and the design of more responsive AI systems.

      Reasoning and strategic behavior in social interactions is a hallmark of intelligence. This form of reasoning is significantly more sophisticated than isolated planning or reasoning tasks in static settings (e.g., math problem solving). In this paper, we present Strategic Planning, Interaction, and Negotiation (SPIN-Bench), a new multi-domain evaluation designed to measure the intelligence of strategic planning and social reasoning. While many existing benchmarks focus on narrow planning or single-agent reasoning, SPIN-Bench combines classical PDDL tasks, competitive board games, cooperative card games, and multi-agent negotiation scenarios in one unified framework. The framework includes both a benchmark as well as an arena to simulate and evaluate the variety of social settings to test reasoning and strategic behavior of AI agents. We formulate the benchmark SPIN-Bench by systematically varying action spaces, state complexity, and the number of interacting agents to simulate a variety of social settings where success depends on not only methodical and step-wise decision making, but also conceptual inference of other (adversarial or cooperative) participants. Our experiments reveal that while contemporary LLMs handle basic fact retrieval and short-range planning reasonably well, they encounter significant performance bottlenecks in tasks requiring deep multi-hop reasoning over large state spaces and socially adept coordination under uncertainty. We envision SPIN-Bench as a catalyst for future research on robust multi-agent planning, social reasoning, and human--AI teaming. Project Website: https://spinbench.github.io/

      Video-based Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have witnessed substantial advancements in recent years, propelled by the advancement in multi-modal LLMs. Although these models have demonstrated proficiency in providing the overall description of videos, they struggle with fine-grained understanding, particularly in aspects such as visual dynamics and video details inquiries. To tackle these shortcomings, we find that fine-tuning Video-LLMs on self-supervised fragment tasks, greatly improve their fine-grained video understanding abilities. Hence we propose two key contributions:(1) Self-Supervised Fragment Fine-Tuning (SF$^2$T), a novel effortless fine-tuning method, employs the rich inherent characteristics of videos for training, while unlocking more fine-grained understanding ability of Video-LLMs. Moreover, it relieves researchers from labor-intensive annotations and smartly circumvents the limitations of natural language, which often fails to capture the complex spatiotemporal variations in videos; (2) A novel benchmark dataset, namely FineVidBench, for rigorously assessing Video-LLMs' performance at both the scene and fragment levels, offering a comprehensive evaluation of their capabilities. We assessed multiple models and validated the effectiveness of SF$^2$T on them. Experimental results reveal that our approach improves their ability to capture and interpret spatiotemporal details.

      This paper proposes DeepGreen, an Large Language Model Driven (LLM-Driven) system for detecting corporate green-washing behaviour. Utilizing dual-layer LLM analysis, DeepGreen preliminarily identifies potential green keywords in financial statements and then assesses their implementation degree via iterative semantic analysis of LLM. A core variable GreenImplement is derived from the ratio from the two layers' output. We extract 204 financial statements of 68 companies from A-share market over three years, comprising 89,893 words, and analyse them through DeepGreen. Our analysis, supported by violin plots and K-means clustering, reveals insights and validates the variable against the Huazheng ESG rating. It offers a novel perspective for regulatory agencies and investors, serving as a proactive monitoring tool that complements traditional methods.Empirical tests show that green implementation can significantly boost the asset return rate of companies, but there is heterogeneity in scale. Small and medium-sized companies have limited contribution to asset return via green implementation, so there is a stronger motivation for green-washing.

      This study examines hallucinations in Large Language Model (LLM) translations into Irish, specifically focusing on instances where the models generate novel, non-existent words. We classify these hallucinations within verb and noun categories, identifying six distinct patterns among the latter. Additionally, we analyse whether these hallucinations adhere to Irish morphological rules and what linguistic tendencies they exhibit. Our findings show that while both GPT-4.o and GPT-4.o Mini produce similar types of hallucinations, the Mini model generates them at a significantly higher frequency. Beyond classification, the discussion raises speculative questions about the implications of these hallucinations for the Irish language. Rather than seeking definitive answers, we offer food for thought regarding the increasing use of LLMs and their potential role in shaping Irish vocabulary and linguistic evolution. We aim to prompt discussion on how such technologies might influence language over time, particularly in the context of low-resource, morphologically rich languages.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as promising tools for automated reinforcement learning (RL) reward design, owing to their robust capabilities in commonsense reasoning and code generation. By engaging in dialogues with RL agents, LLMs construct a Reward Observation Space (ROS) by selecting relevant environment states and defining their internal operations. However, existing frameworks have not effectively leveraged historical exploration data or manual task descriptions to iteratively evolve this space. In this paper, we propose a novel heuristic framework that enhances LLM-driven reward design by evolving the ROS through a table-based exploration caching mechanism and a text-code reconciliation strategy. Our framework introduces a state execution table, which tracks the historical usage and success rates of environment states, overcoming the Markovian constraint typically found in LLM dialogues and facilitating more effective exploration. Furthermore, we reconcile user-provided task descriptions with expert-defined success criteria using structured prompts, ensuring alignment in reward design objectives. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark RL tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of the proposed framework. Code and video demos are available at jingjjjjjie.github.io/LLM2Reward.

      Despite the steady progress in machine translation evaluation, existing automatic metrics struggle to capture how well meaning is preserved beyond sentence boundaries. We posit that reliance on a single intrinsic quality score, trained to mimic human judgments, might be insufficient for evaluating translations of long, complex passages, and a more ``pragmatic'' approach that assesses how accurately key information is conveyed by a translation in context is needed. We introduce TREQA (Translation Evaluation via Question-Answering), a framework that extrinsically evaluates translation quality by assessing how accurately candidate translations answer reading comprehension questions that target key information in the original source or reference texts. In challenging domains that require long-range understanding, such as literary texts, we show that TREQA is competitive with and, in some cases, outperforms state-of-the-art neural and LLM-based metrics in ranking alternative paragraph-level translations, despite never being explicitly optimized to correlate with human judgments. Furthermore, the generated questions and answers offer interpretability: empirical analysis shows that they effectively target translation errors identified by experts in evaluated datasets.

      In-context knowledge editing (IKE) enables efficient modification of large language model (LLM) outputs without parameter changes and at zero-cost. However, it can be misused to manipulate responses opaquely, e.g., insert misinformation or offensive content. Such malicious interventions could be incorporated into high-level wrapped APIs where the final input prompt is not shown to end-users. To address this issue, we investigate the detection and reversal of IKE-edits. First, we demonstrate that IKE-edits can be detected with high accuracy (F1 > 80\%) using only the top-10 output probabilities of the next token, even in a black-box setting, e.g. proprietary LLMs with limited output information. Further, we introduce the novel task of reversing IKE-edits using specially tuned reversal tokens. We explore using both continuous and discrete reversal tokens, achieving over 80\% accuracy in recovering original, unedited outputs across multiple LLMs. Our continuous reversal tokens prove particularly effective, with minimal impact on unedited prompts. Through analysis of output distributions, attention patterns, and token rankings, we provide insights into IKE's effects on LLMs and how reversal tokens mitigate them. This work represents a significant step towards enhancing LLM resilience against potential misuse of in-context editing, improving their transparency and trustworthiness.

      Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been deployed to tackle various software engineering (SE) tasks like code generation, significantly advancing the automation of SE tasks. However, assessing the quality of these LLM-generated code and text remains challenging. The commonly used Pass@k metric necessitates extensive unit tests and configured environments, demands a high labor cost, and is not suitable for evaluating LLM-generated text. Conventional metrics like BLEU, which measure only lexical rather than semantic similarity, have also come under scrutiny. In response, a new trend has emerged to employ LLMs for automated evaluation, known as LLM-as-a-judge. These LLM-as-a-judge methods are claimed to better mimic human assessment than conventional metrics without relying on high-quality reference answers. Nevertheless, their exact human alignment in SE tasks remains unexplored. In this paper, we empirically explore LLM-as-a-judge methods for evaluating SE tasks, focusing on their alignment with human judgments. We select seven LLM-as-a-judge methods that utilize general-purpose LLMs, alongside two LLMs specifically fine-tuned for evaluation. After generating and manually scoring LLM responses on three recent SE datasets of code translation, code generation, and code summarization, we then prompt these methods to evaluate each response. Finally, we compare the scores generated by these methods with human evaluation. The results indicate that output-based methods reach the highest Pearson correlation of 81.32 and 68.51 with human scores in code translation and generation, achieving near-human evaluation, noticeably outperforming ChrF++, one of the best conventional metrics, at 34.23 and 64.92. Such output-based methods prompt LLMs to output judgments directly, and exhibit more balanced score distributions that resemble human score patterns. Finally, we provide...

      Large language model (LLM) inference serving systems are essential to various LLM-based applications. As demand for LLM services continues to grow, scaling these systems to handle high request rates while meeting latency Service-Level Objectives (SLOs), referred to as effective throughput, becomes critical. However, existing systems often struggle to improve effective throughput, primarily due to a significant decline in Time To First Token (TTFT) SLO attainment. We identify two major causes of this bottleneck: (1) memory-intensive KV cache that limits batch size expansion under GPU memory constraints, and (2) rigid batch composition enforced by the default First-Come-First-Serve scheduling policy. In this paper, we introduce Apt-Serve, a scalable framework designed to enhance effective throughput in LLM inference serving. Apt-Serve features a new hybrid cache scheme that combines KV cache with a memory-efficient hidden cache for reusable input hidden state vectors, allowing large batch sizes and improving request concurrency. Based on the hybrid cache, Apt-Serve employs an adaptive runtime scheduling mechanism that dynamically optimizes batch composition. We formally define the adaptive scheduling optimization problem and propose an efficient algorithm with theoretical guarantees. Extensive evaluations on three real-world datasets and LLMs ranging from 13B to 66B parameters demonstrate that Apt-Serve achieves up to 8.8x improvement in effective throughput compared to the state-of-the-art inference serving systems.

      Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in various natural language processing (NLP) applications. However, the high memory and computation cost induced by the KV cache limits the inference efficiency, especially for long input sequences. Compute-in-memory (CIM)-based accelerators have been proposed for LLM acceleration with KV cache pruning. However, as existing accelerators only support static pruning with a fixed pattern or dynamic pruning with primitive implementations, they suffer from either high accuracy degradation or low efficiency. In this paper, we propose a ferroelectric FET (FeFET)-based unified content addressable memory (CAM) and CIM architecture, dubbed as UniCAIM. UniCAIM features simultaneous support for static and dynamic pruning with 3 computation modes: 1) in the CAM mode, UniCAIM enables approximate similarity measurement in O(1) time for dynamic KV cache pruning with high energy efficiency; 2) in the charge-domain CIM mode, static pruning can be supported based on accumulative similarity score, which is much more flexible compared to fixed patterns; 3) in the current-domain mode, exact attention computation can be conducted with a subset of selected KV cache. We further propose a novel CAM/CIM cell design that leverages the multi-level characteristics of FeFETs for signed multibit storage of the KV cache and in-place attention computation. With extensive experimental results, we demonstrate UniCAIM can reduce the area-energy-delay product (AEDP) by 8.2-831x over the state-ofthe-art CIM-based LLM accelerators at the circuit level, along with high accuracy comparable with dense attention at the application level, showing its great potential for efficient long-context LLM inference.

      Hybrid models that combine the language modeling capabilities of Attention layers with the efficiency of Recurrent layers (e.g., State Space Models) have gained traction in practically supporting long contexts in Large Language Model serving. Yet, the unique properties of these models complicate the usage of complementary efficiency optimizations such as prefix caching that skip redundant computations across requests. Most notably, their use of in-place state updates for recurrent layers precludes rolling back cache entries for partial sequence overlaps, and instead mandates only exact-match cache hits; the effect is a deluge of (large) cache entries per sequence, most of which yield minimal reuse opportunities. We present Marconi, the first system that supports efficient prefix caching with Hybrid LLMs. Key to Marconi are its novel admission and eviction policies that more judiciously assess potential cache entries based not only on recency, but also on (1) forecasts of their reuse likelihood across a taxonomy of different hit scenarios, and (2) the compute savings that hits deliver relative to memory footprints. Across diverse workloads and Hybrid models, Marconi achieves up to 34.4$\times$ higher token hit rates (71.1% or 617 ms lower TTFT) compared to state-of-the-art prefix caching systems.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable across academia, industry, and daily applications, yet current evaluation methods struggle to keep pace with their rapid development. In this paper, we analyze the core limitations of traditional evaluation pipelines and propose a novel metric, the Model Utilization Index (MUI), which introduces mechanism interpretability techniques to complement traditional performance metrics. MUI quantifies the extent to which a model leverages its capabilities to complete tasks. The core idea is that to assess an LLM's overall ability, we must evaluate not only its task performance but also the effort expended to achieve the outcome. Our extensive experiments reveal an inverse relationship between MUI and performance, from which we deduce a common trend observed in popular LLMs, which we term the Utility Law. Based on this, we derive four corollaries that address key challenges, including training judgement, the issue of data contamination, fairness in model comparison, and data diversity. We hope that our survey, novel metric, and utility law will foster mutual advancement in both evaluation and mechanism interpretability. Our code can be found at https://github.com/ALEX-nlp/MUI-Eva.

      Emerging services such as augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) have increased the volume of data transmitted in wireless communication systems, revealing the limitations of traditional Shannon theory. To address these limitations, semantic communication has been proposed as a solution that prioritizes the meaning of messages over the exact transmission of bits. This paper explores semantic communication for text data transmission in end-to-end (E2E) systems through a novel approach called KG-LLM semantic communication, which integrates knowledge graph (KG) extraction and large language model (LLM) coding. In this method, the transmitter first utilizes a KG to extract key entities and relationships from sentences. The extracted information is then encoded using an LLM to obtain the semantic meaning. On the receiver side, messages are decoded using another LLM, while a bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (i.e., BERT) model further refines the reconstructed sentences for improved semantic similarity. The KG-LLM semantic communication method reduces the transmitted text data volume by 30% through KG-based compression and achieves 84\% semantic similarity between the original and received messages. This demonstrates the KG-LLM methods efficiency and robustness in semantic communication systems, outperforming the deep learning-based semantic communication model (DeepSC), which achieves only 63%.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Watermarking has emerged as a promising technique for detecting texts generated by LLMs. Current research has primarily focused on three design criteria: high quality of the watermarked text, high detectability, and robustness against removal attack. However, the security against spoofing attacks remains relatively understudied. For example, a piggyback attack can maliciously alter the meaning of watermarked text-transforming it into hate speech-while preserving the original watermark, thereby damaging the reputation of the LLM provider. We identify two core challenges that make defending against spoofing difficult: (1) the need for watermarks to be both sensitive to semantic-distorting changes and insensitive to semantic-preserving edits, and (2) the contradiction between the need to detect global semantic shifts and the local, auto-regressive nature of most watermarking schemes. To address these challenges, we propose a semantic-aware watermarking algorithm that post-hoc embeds watermarks into a given target text while preserving its original meaning. Our method introduces a semantic mapping model, which guides the generation of a green-red token list, contrastively trained to be sensitive to semantic-distorting changes and insensitive to semantic-preserving changes. Experiments on two standard benchmarks demonstrate strong robustness against removal attacks and security against spoofing attacks, including sentiment reversal and toxic content insertion, while maintaining high watermark detectability. Our approach offers a significant step toward more secure and semantically aware watermarking for LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/UCSB-NLP-Chang/contrastive-watermark.

      Automated radiology report generation (RRG) holds potential to reduce radiologists' workload, especially as recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) enable the development of multimodal models for chest X-ray (CXR) report generation. However, multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) are resource-intensive, requiring vast datasets and substantial computational cost for training. To address these challenges, we propose a retrieval-augmented generation approach that leverages multimodal retrieval and LLMs to generate radiology reports while mitigating hallucinations and reducing computational demands. Our method uses LLMs to extract key phrases from radiology reports, effectively focusing on essential diagnostic information. Through exploring effective training strategies, including image encoder structure search, adding noise to text embeddings, and additional training objectives, we combine complementary pre-trained image encoders and adopt contrastive learning between text and semantic image embeddings. We evaluate our approach on MIMIC-CXR dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results on CheXbert metrics and competitive RadGraph F1 metric alongside MLLMs, without requiring LLM fine-tuning. Our method demonstrates robust generalization for multi-view RRG, making it suitable for comprehensive clinical applications.

Our framework emphasizes top-down sector allocation by processing multiple data streams simultaneously, including policy documents, economic indicators, and sentiment patterns. Empirical results demonstrate superior risk-adjusted returns compared to traditional cross momentum strategies, achieving a Sharpe ratio of 2.51 and portfolio return of 8.79% versus -0.61 and -1.39% respectively. These results suggest that LLM-based systematic macro analysis presents a viable approach for enhancing automated portfolio allocation decisions at the sector level.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse tasks, yet their inference processes are hindered by substantial time and energy demands due to single-token generation at each decoding step. While previous methods such as speculative decoding mitigate these inefficiencies by producing multiple tokens per step, each token is still generated by its single-token distribution, thereby enhancing speed without improving effectiveness. In contrast, our work simultaneously enhances inference speed and improves the output effectiveness. We consider multi-token joint decoding (MTJD), which generates multiple tokens from their joint distribution at each iteration, theoretically reducing perplexity and enhancing task performance. However, MTJD suffers from the high cost of sampling from the joint distribution of multiple tokens. Inspired by speculative decoding, we introduce multi-token assisted decoding (MTAD), a novel framework designed to accelerate MTJD. MTAD leverages a smaller auxiliary model to approximate the joint distribution of a larger model, incorporating a verification mechanism that not only ensures the accuracy of this approximation, but also improves the decoding efficiency over conventional speculative decoding. Theoretically, we demonstrate that MTAD closely approximates exact MTJD with bounded error. Empirical evaluations using Llama-2 and OPT models ranging from 13B to 70B parameters across various tasks reveal that MTAD reduces perplexity by 21.2% and improves downstream performance compared to standard single-token sampling. Furthermore, MTAD achieves a 1.42x speed-up and consumes 1.54x less energy than conventional speculative decoding methods. These results highlight MTAD's ability to make multi-token joint decoding both effective and efficient, promoting more sustainable and high-performance deployment of LLMs.

      The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has outpaced traditional evaluation methods. Static benchmarks fail to capture the depth and breadth of LLM capabilities and eventually become obsolete, while most dynamic approaches either rely too heavily on LLM-based evaluation or remain constrained by predefined test sets. We introduce Prism, a flexible, dynamic benchmarking framework designed for comprehensive LLM assessment. Prism builds on three key components: (1) a tree-based state representation that models evaluation as a Markov Decision Process, (2) a Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm adapted to uncover challenging evaluation scenarios, and (3) a multi-agent evaluation pipeline that enables simultaneous assessment of diverse capabilities. To ensure robust evaluation, Prism integrates structural measurements of tree exploration patterns with performance metrics across difficulty levels, providing detailed diagnostics of error patterns, test coverage, and solution approaches. Through extensive experiments on five state-of-the-art LLMs, we analyze how model architecture and scale influence code generation performance across varying task difficulties. Our results demonstrate Prism's effectiveness as a dynamic benchmark that evolves with model advancements while offering deeper insights into their limitations.

      The adaptation of large language models (LLMs) to time series forecasting poses unique challenges, as time series data is continuous in nature, while LLMs operate on discrete tokens. Despite the success of LLMs in natural language processing (NLP) and other structured domains, aligning time series data with language-based representations while maintaining both predictive accuracy and interpretability remains a significant hurdle. Existing methods have attempted to reprogram time series data into text-based forms, but these often fall short in delivering meaningful, interpretable results. In this paper, we propose a multi-level text alignment framework for time series forecasting using LLMs that not only improves prediction accuracy but also enhances the interpretability of time series representations. Our method decomposes time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components, which are then reprogrammed into component-specific text representations. We introduce a multi-level alignment mechanism, where component-specific embeddings are aligned with pre-trained word tokens, enabling more interpretable forecasts. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in accuracy while providing good interpretability.

      Developing algorithms to differentiate between machine-generated texts and human-written texts has garnered substantial attention in recent years. Existing methods in this direction typically concern an offline setting where a dataset containing a mix of real and machine-generated texts is given upfront, and the task is to determine whether each sample in the dataset is from a large language model (LLM) or a human. However, in many practical scenarios, sources such as news websites, social media accounts, or on other forums publish content in a streaming fashion. Therefore, in this online scenario, how to quickly and accurately determine whether the source is an LLM with strong statistical guarantees is crucial for these media or platforms to function effectively and prevent the spread of misinformation and other potential misuse of LLMs. To tackle the problem of online detection, we develop an algorithm based on the techniques of sequential hypothesis testing by betting that not only builds upon and complements existing offline detection techniques but also enjoys statistical guarantees, which include a controlled false positive rate and the expected time to correctly identify a source as an LLM. Experiments were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

      As demand for Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI agents rapidly grows, optimizing systems for efficient LLM inference becomes critical. While significant efforts have targeted system-level engineering, little is explored through a mathematical modeling and queuing perspective. In this paper, we aim to develop the queuing fundamentals for LLM inference, bridging the gap between queuing and LLM system communities. In particular, we study the throughput aspect in LLM inference systems. We prove that a large class of 'work-conserving' scheduling algorithms can achieve maximum throughput for both individual requests and AI agent workloads, highlighting 'work-conserving' as a key design principle in practice. Evaluations of real-world systems show that Orca and Sarathi-serve are throughput-optimal, reassuring practitioners, while FastTransformer and vanilla vLLM are not maximally stable and should be used with caution. Our results highlight the substantial benefits queuing community can offer in improving LLM inference systems and call for more interdisciplinary developments.

      Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive progress in mathematical reasoning tasks. However, current evaluation benchmarks predominantly focus on the accuracy of final answers, often overlooking the crucial logical rigor for mathematical problem solving. The claim that state-of-the-art LLMs can solve Math Olympiad-level problems requires closer examination. To explore this, we conducted both qualitative and quantitative human evaluations of proofs generated by LLMs, and developed a schema for automatically assessing their reasoning capabilities. Our study reveals that current LLMs fall significantly short of solving challenging Olympiad-level problems and frequently fail to distinguish correct mathematical reasoning from clearly flawed solutions. Our analyses demonstrate that the occasional correct final answers provided by LLMs often result from pattern recognition or heuristic shortcuts rather than genuine mathematical reasoning. These findings underscore the substantial gap between LLM performance and human expertise in advanced mathematical reasoning and highlight the importance of developing benchmarks that prioritize the soundness of the reasoning used to arrive at an answer rather than the mere correctness of the final answers.

      Reasoning-enabled large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive performance in complex logical and mathematical tasks, yet their effectiveness in evaluating natural language generation remains unexplored. This study systematically compares reasoning-based LLMs (DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o3) with their non-reasoning counterparts across machine translation (MT) and text summarization (TS) evaluation tasks. We evaluate eight models across three architectural categories, including state-of-the-art reasoning models, their distilled variants (ranging from 8B to 70B parameters), and equivalent conventional, non-reasoning LLMs. Our experiments on WMT23 and SummEval benchmarks reveal that the benefits of reasoning capabilities are highly model and task-dependent: while OpenAI o3-mini models show consistent performance improvements with increased reasoning intensity, DeepSeek-R1 underperforms compared to its non-reasoning variant, with exception to certain aspects of TS evaluation. Correlation analysis demonstrates that increased reasoning token usage positively correlates with evaluation quality in o3-mini models. Furthermore, our results show that distillation of reasoning capabilities maintains reasonable performance in medium-sized models (32B) but degrades substantially in smaller variants (8B). This work provides the first comprehensive assessment of reasoning LLMs for NLG evaluation and offers insights into their practical use.

      Jailbreak attacks, which aim to cause LLMs to perform unrestricted behaviors, have become a critical and challenging direction in AI safety. Despite achieving the promising attack success rate using dictionary-based evaluation, existing jailbreak attack methods fail to output detailed contents to satisfy the harmful request, leading to poor performance on GPT-based evaluation. To this end, we propose a black-box jailbreak attack termed GeneShift, by using a genetic algorithm to optimize the scenario shifts. Firstly, we observe that the malicious queries perform optimally under different scenario shifts. Based on it, we develop a genetic algorithm to evolve and select the hybrid of scenario shifts. It guides our method to elicit detailed and actionable harmful responses while keeping the seemingly benign facade, improving stealthiness. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of GeneShift. Notably, GeneShift increases the jailbreak success rate from 0% to 60% when direct prompting alone would fail.

Analysis of experimental results from literature can uncover important trends across studies, but the time-consuming nature of manual data extraction limits its use. Our study presents a semi-automated approach for literature analysis that accelerates data extraction using LLMs. It automatically identifies relevant arXiv papers, extracts experimental results and related attributes, and organizes them into a structured dataset, LLMEvalDB. We then conduct an automated literature analysis of frontier LLMs, reducing the effort of paper surveying and data extraction by more than 93% compared to manual approaches. We validate LLMEvalDB by showing that it reproduces key findings from a recent manual analysis of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and also uncovers new insights that go beyond it, showing, for example, that in-context examples benefit coding and multimodal tasks but offer limited gains in math reasoning tasks compared to zero-shot CoT. Our automatically updatable dataset enables continuous tracking of target models by extracting evaluation studies as new data becomes available.

Leading this evolution are proprietary LLMs like GPT-4 and GPT-o1, which have captured widespread attention in the AI community due to their remarkable performance and versatility. Simultaneously, open-source LLMs, such as LLaMA, have made great contributions to the ever-increasing popularity of LLMs due to the ease to customize and deploy the models across diverse applications. Although open-source LLMs present unprecedented opportunities for innovation and research, the commercialization of LLMs has raised concerns about transparency, reproducibility, and safety. Many open-source LLMs fail to meet fundamental transparency requirements by withholding essential components like training code and data, which may hinder further innovations on LLMs. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Moxin 7B, a fully open-source LLM developed, adhering to principles of open science, open source, open data, and open access. We release the pre-training code and configurations, training and fine-tuning datasets, and intermediate and final checkpoints, aiming to make continuous commitments to fully open-source LLMs. After pre-training and obtaining the base model, we finetune the Moxin Base model with SOTA post-training framework and instruction data to obtain Moxin Instruct model. To improve the reasoning capability, we further finetune our Instruct model with chain-of-thought data distilled from DeepSeek R1, and then use Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), an efficient and effective reinforcement learning algorithm following DeepSeek R1, to finetune our model, leading to the Moxin Reasoning model.

Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising improvements in accuracy and efficiency for this task. This study evaluates the performance and consistency of eight LLMs; four reasoning (Qwen QWQ, Deepseek Reasoner, GPT o3 Mini, Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking) and four non-reasoning (Llama 3.3, GPT 4o Mini, Gemini 2.0 Flash, Deepseek Chat); in classifying clinical discharge summaries using the MIMIC-IV dataset. Using cTAKES to structure clinical narratives, models were assessed across three experimental runs, with majority voting determining final predictions. Results showed that reasoning models outperformed non-reasoning models in accuracy (71% vs 68%) and F1 score (67% vs 60%), with Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking achieving the highest accuracy (75%) and F1 score (76%). However, non-reasoning models demonstrated greater stability (91% vs 84% consistency). Performance varied across ICD-10 codes, with reasoning models excelling in complex cases but struggling with abstract categories. Findings indicate a trade-off between accuracy and consistency, suggesting that a hybrid approach could optimise clinical coding.

      Safety is a paramount concern for large language models (LLMs) in open deployment, motivating the development of safeguard methods that enforce ethical and responsible use through safety alignment or guardrail mechanisms. Jailbreak attacks that exploit the \emph{false negatives} of safeguard methods have emerged as a prominent research focus in the field of LLM security. However, we found that the malicious attackers could also exploit false positives of safeguards, i.e., fooling the safeguard model to block safe content mistakenly, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) affecting LLM users. To bridge the knowledge gap of this overlooked threat, we explore multiple attack methods that include inserting a short adversarial prompt into user prompt templates and corrupting the LLM on the server by poisoned fine-tuning. In both ways, the attack triggers safeguard rejections of user requests from the client. Our evaluation demonstrates the severity of this threat across multiple scenarios. For instance, in the scenario of white-box adversarial prompt injection, the attacker can use our optimization process to automatically generate seemingly safe adversarial prompts, approximately only 30 characters long, that universally block over 97% of user requests on Llama Guard 3. These findings reveal a new dimension in LLM safeguard evaluation -- adversarial robustness to false positives.

However, the accuracy of hate speech detection systems heavily relies on human-labeled data, which is inherently susceptible to biases. While previous work has examined the issue, the interplay between the characteristics of the annotator and those of the target of the hate are still unexplored. We fill this gap by leveraging an extensive dataset with rich socio-demographic information of both annotators and targets, uncovering how human biases manifest in relation to the target's attributes. Our analysis surfaces the presence of widespread biases, which we quantitatively describe and characterize based on their intensity and prevalence, revealing marked differences. Furthermore, we compare human biases with those exhibited by persona-based LLMs. Our findings indicate that while persona-based LLMs do exhibit biases, these differ significantly from those of human annotators. Overall, our work offers new and nuanced results on human biases in hate speech annotations, as well as fresh insights into the design of AI-driven hate speech detection systems.

      Agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in various tasks. Still, they face limitations in tasks requiring specific, structured knowledge, flexibility, or accountable decision-making. While agents are capable of perceiving their environments, forming inferences, planning, and executing actions towards goals, they often face issues such as hallucinations and lack of contextual memory across interactions. This paper explores how Case-Based Reasoning (CBR), a strategy that solves new problems by referencing past experiences, can be integrated into LLM agent frameworks. This integration allows LLMs to leverage explicit knowledge, enhancing their effectiveness. We systematically review the theoretical foundations of these enhanced agents, identify critical framework components, and formulate a mathematical model for the CBR processes of case retrieval, adaptation, and learning. We also evaluate CBR-enhanced agents against other methods like Chain-of-Thought reasoning and standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation, analyzing their relative strengths. Moreover, we explore how leveraging CBR's cognitive dimensions (including self-reflection, introspection, and curiosity) via goal-driven autonomy mechanisms can further enhance the LLM agent capabilities. Contributing to the ongoing research on neuro-symbolic hybrid systems, this work posits CBR as a viable technique for enhancing the reasoning skills and cognitive aspects of autonomous LLM agents.

      Knowledge is fundamental to the overall capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The knowledge paradigm of a model, which dictates how it encodes and utilizes knowledge, significantly affects its performance. Despite the continuous development of LLMs under existing knowledge paradigms, issues within these frameworks continue to constrain model potential. This blog post highlight three critical open problems limiting model capabilities: (1) challenges in knowledge updating for LLMs, (2) the failure of reverse knowledge generalization (the reversal curse), and (3) conflicts in internal knowledge. We review recent progress made in addressing these issues and discuss potential general solutions. Based on observations in these areas, we propose a hypothetical paradigm based on Contextual Knowledge Scaling, and further outline implementation pathways that remain feasible within contemporary techniques. Evidence suggests this approach holds potential to address current shortcomings, serving as our vision for future model paradigms. This blog post aims to provide researchers with a brief overview of progress in LLM knowledge systems, while provide inspiration for the development of next-generation model architectures.

      Batch data analytics is a growing application for Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs enable users to perform a wide range of natural language tasks, such as classification, entity extraction, and translation, over large datasets. However, LLM inference is highly costly and slow: for example, an NVIDIA L4 GPU running Llama3-8B can only process 6 KB of text per second, taking about a day to handle 15 GB of data; processing a similar amount of data costs around $10K on OpenAI's GPT-4o. In this paper, we propose novel techniques that can significantly reduce the cost of LLM calls for relational data analytics workloads. Our key contribution is developing efficient algorithms for reordering the rows and the fields within each row of an input table to maximize key-value (KV) cache reuse when performing LLM serving. As such, our approach can be easily applied to existing analytics systems and serving platforms. Our evaluation shows that our solution can yield up to 3.4x improvement in job completion time on a benchmark of diverse LLM-based queries using Llama 3 models. Our solution also achieves a 32% cost savings under OpenAI and Anthropic pricing models.

      Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have been demonstrated to possess intrinsic reasoning capabilities that can emerge naturally when expanding the response space. However, the neural representation mechanisms underlying these intrinsic capabilities and approaches for their optimal utilization remain inadequately understood. In this work, we make the key discovery that a simple linear classifier can effectively detect intrinsic reasoning capabilities in LLMs' activation space, particularly within specific representation types and network layers. Based on this finding, we propose a classifier-guided search framework that strategically explore a tree-structured response space. In each node expansion, the classifier serves as a scoring and ranking mechanism that efficiently allocates computational resources by identifying and prioritizing more thoughtful reasoning directions for continuation. After completing the tree expansion, we collect answers from all branches to form a candidate answer pool. We propose a branch-aggregation selection method that marginalizes over all supporting branches by aggregating their thoughtfulness scores, thereby identifying the optimal answer from the pool. Experimental results show that our framework's comprehensive exploration not only covers valid reasoning chains but also effectively identifies them, achieving significant improvements across multiple arithmetic reasoning benchmarks.

      Distributed databases are critical infrastructures for today's large-scale software systems, making effective failure management essential to ensure software availability. However, existing approaches often overlook the role distinctions within distributed databases and rely on small-scale models with limited generalization capabilities. In this paper, we conduct a preliminary empirical study to emphasize the unique significance of different roles. Building on this insight, we propose AgentFM, a role-aware failure management framework for distributed databases powered by LLM-driven multi-agents. AgentFM addresses failure management by considering system roles, data roles, and task roles, with a meta-agent orchestrating these components. Preliminary evaluations using Apache IoTDB demonstrate the effectiveness of AgentFM and open new directions for further research.

      Business processes are fundamental to organizational operations, yet their optimization remains challenging due to the timeconsuming nature of manual process analysis. Our paper harnesses Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate value-added analysis, a qualitative process analysis technique that aims to identify steps in the process that do not deliver value. To date, this technique is predominantly manual, time-consuming, and subjective. Our method offers a more principled approach which operates in two phases: first, decomposing high-level activities into detailed steps to enable granular analysis, and second, performing a value-added analysis to classify each step according to Lean principles. This approach enables systematic identification of waste while maintaining the semantic understanding necessary for qualitative analysis. We develop our approach using 50 business process models, for which we collect and publish manual ground-truth labels. Our evaluation, comparing zero-shot baselines with more structured prompts reveals (a) a consistent benefit of structured prompting and (b) promising performance for both tasks. We discuss the potential for LLMs to augment human expertise in qualitative process analysis while reducing the time and subjectivity inherent in manual approaches.

      Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising pre-screening tool, improving early disease detection and providing enhanced healthcare access for underprivileged communities. The early diagnosis of various diseases continues to be a significant challenge in healthcare, primarily due to the nonspecific nature of early symptoms, the shortage of expert medical practitioners, and the need for prolonged clinical evaluations, all of which can delay treatment and adversely affect patient outcomes. With impressive accuracy in prediction across a range of diseases, LLMs have the potential to revolutionize clinical pre-screening and decision-making for various medical conditions. In this work, we study the diagnostic capability of LLMs for Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) with real world patients data. Patient data was collected alongside diagnoses from medical experts, and the performance of LLMs was evaluated in comparison to expert diagnoses for RA disease prediction. We notice an interesting pattern in disease diagnosis and find an unexpected \textit{misalignment between prediction and explanation}. We conduct a series of multi-round analyses using different LLM agents. The best-performing model accurately predicts rheumatoid arthritis (RA) diseases approximately 95\% of the time. However, when medical experts evaluated the reasoning generated by the model, they found that nearly 68\% of the reasoning was incorrect. This study highlights a clear misalignment between LLMs high prediction accuracy and its flawed reasoning, raising important questions about relying on LLM explanations in clinical settings. \textbf{LLMs provide incorrect reasoning to arrive at the correct answer for RA disease diagnosis.}

      In this paper, we show it is possible to bypass the safety guardrails of large language models (LLMs) through a humorous prompt including the unsafe request. In particular, our method does not edit the unsafe request and follows a fixed template -- it is simple to implement and does not need additional LLMs to craft prompts. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method across different LLMs. We also show that both removing and adding more humor to our method can reduce its effectiveness -- excessive humor possibly distracts the LLM from fulfilling its unsafe request. Thus, we argue that LLM jailbreaking occurs when there is a proper balance between focus on the unsafe request and presence of humor.

      Watermarking has emerged as a promising technique for detecting texts generated by LLMs. Current research has primarily focused on three design criteria: high quality of the watermarked text, high detectability, and robustness against removal attack. However, the security against spoofing attacks remains relatively understudied. For example, a piggyback attack can maliciously alter the meaning of watermarked text-transforming it into hate speech-while preserving the original watermark, thereby damaging the reputation of the LLM provider. We identify two core challenges that make defending against spoofing difficult: (1) the need for watermarks to be both sensitive to semantic-distorting changes and insensitive to semantic-preserving edits, and (2) the contradiction between the need to detect global semantic shifts and the local, auto-regressive nature of most watermarking schemes. To address these challenges, we propose a semantic-aware watermarking algorithm that post-hoc embeds watermarks into a given target text while preserving its original meaning. Our method introduces a semantic mapping model, which guides the generation of a green-red token list, contrastively trained to be sensitive to semantic-distorting changes and insensitive to semantic-preserving changes. Experiments on two standard benchmarks demonstrate strong robustness against removal attacks and security against spoofing attacks, including sentiment reversal and toxic content insertion, while maintaining high watermark detectability. Our approach offers a significant step toward more secure and semantically aware watermarking for LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/UCSB-NLP-Chang/contrastive-watermark.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to demonstrate imbalanced biases against certain groups. However, the study of unprovoked targeted attacks by LLMs towards at-risk populations remains underexplored. Our paper presents three novel contributions: (1) the explicit evaluation of LLM-generated attacks on highly vulnerable mental health groups; (2) a network-based framework to study the propagation of relative biases; and (3) an assessment of the relative degree of stigmatization that emerges from these attacks. Our analysis of a recently released large-scale bias audit dataset reveals that mental health entities occupy central positions within attack narrative networks, as revealed by a significantly higher mean centrality of closeness (p-value = 4.06e-10) and dense clustering (Gini coefficient = 0.7). Drawing from sociological foundations of stigmatization theory, our stigmatization analysis indicates increased labeling components for mental health disorder-related targets relative to initial targets in generation chains. Taken together, these insights shed light on the structural predilections of large language models to heighten harmful discourse and highlight the need for suitable approaches for mitigation.

      As telecommunication service providers shifting their focus to analyzing user behavior for package design and marketing interventions, a critical challenge lies in developing a unified, end-to-end framework capable of modeling long-term and periodic user behavior sequences with diverse time granularities, multi-modal data inputs, and heterogeneous labels. This paper introduces GTS-LUM, a novel user behavior model that redefines modeling paradigms in telecommunication settings. GTS-LUM adopts a (multi-modal) encoder-adapter-LLM decoder architecture, enhanced with several telecom-specific innovations. Specifically, the model incorporates an advanced timestamp processing method to handle varying time granularities. It also supports multi-modal data inputs -- including structured tables and behavior co-occurrence graphs -- and aligns these with semantic information extracted by a tokenizer using a Q-former structure. Additionally, GTS-LUM integrates a front-placed target-aware mechanism to highlight historical behaviors most relevant to the target. Extensive experiments on industrial dataset validate the effectiveness of this end-to-end framework and also demonstrate that GTS-LUM outperforms LLM4Rec approaches which are popular in recommendation systems, offering an effective and generalizing solution for user behavior modeling in telecommunications.

      Scaling up deliberative and voting participation is a longstanding endeavor -- a cornerstone for direct democracy and legitimate collective choice. Recent breakthroughs in generative artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) unravel new capabilities for AI personal assistants to overcome cognitive bandwidth limitations of humans, providing decision support or even direct representation of human voters at large scale. However, the quality of this representation and what underlying biases manifest when delegating collective decision-making to LLMs is an alarming and timely challenge to tackle. By rigorously emulating with high realism more than >50K LLM voting personas in 306 real-world voting elections, we disentangle the nature of different biases in LLMS (GPT 3, GPT 3.5, and Llama2). Complex preferential ballot formats exhibit significant inconsistencies compared to simpler majoritarian elections that show higher consistency. Strikingly though, by demonstrating for the first time in real-world a proportional representation of voters in direct democracy, we are also able to show that fair ballot aggregation methods, such as equal shares, prove to be a win-win: fairer voting outcomes for humans with fairer AI representation, especially for voters who are likely to abstain. This novel underlying relationship proves paramount for democratic resilience in progressives scenarios with low voters turnout and voter fatigue supported by AI representatives: abstained voters are mitigated by recovering highly representative voting outcomes that are fairer. These interdisciplinary insights provide remarkable foundations for science, policymakers, and citizens to develop safeguards and resilience for AI risks in democratic innovations.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) can encode complex relationships in their latent spaces, yet harnessing them for optimization under uncertainty remains challenging. We address this gap with a novel architecture that reframes LLM finetuning as Gaussian process (GP) marginal likelihood optimization via deep kernel methods. We introduce LLM-based deep kernels, jointly optimized with GPs to preserve the benefits of both - LLMs to provide a rich and flexible input space for Bayesian optimization and - GPs to model this space with predictive uncertainty for more efficient sampling. Applied to Buchwald-Hartwig reaction optimization, our method nearly doubles the discovery rate of high-performing reactions compared to static LLM embeddings (from 24% to 43% coverage of the top 5% reactions in just 50 optimization iterations). We also observe a 14% improvement over domain-specific representations without requiring specialized features. Extensive empirical evaluation across 19 benchmarks - ranging from general chemistry to reaction and molecular property optimization - demonstrates our method's robustness, generality, and consistent improvements across: (1) tasks, (2) LLM architectures (encoder, decoder, encoder-decoder), (3) pretraining domains (chemistry-related or general-purpose) and (4) hyperparameter settings (tuned once on a single dataset). Finally, we explain these improvements: joint LLM-GP optimization through marginal likelihood implicitly performs contrastive learning, aligning representations to produce (1) better-structured embedding spaces, (2) improved uncertainty calibration, and (3) more efficient sampling - without requiring any external loss. This work provides both practical advances in sample-efficient optimization and insights into what makes effective Bayesian optimization.

Inspired by the superior ability in numerous cross-modal tasks for Large Language Models (LLMs), we proposed a novel Vision-LLM union framework to address the issues. Specifically, we introduce frozen LLMs for zero-shot instruction generation based on corresponding medical images, imitating the radiology scanning and report generation process. {To better approximate real-world diagnostic processes}, we generate more precise text instruction from multimodal radiology images (e.g., T1-w or T2-w MRI and CT).

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized in multi-agent systems (MAS) to enhance collaborative problem-solving and interactive reasoning. Recent advancements have enabled LLMs to function as autonomous agents capable of understanding complex interactions across multiple topics. However, deploying LLMs in MAS introduces challenges related to context management, response consistency, and scalability, especially when agents must operate under memory limitations and handle noisy inputs. While prior research has explored optimizing context sharing and response latency in LLM-driven MAS, these efforts often focus on either fully centralized or decentralized configurations, each with distinct trade-offs. In this paper, we develop a probabilistic framework to analyze the impact of shared versus separate context configurations on response consistency and response times in LLM-based MAS. We introduce the Response Consistency Index (RCI) as a metric to evaluate the effects of context limitations, noise, and inter-agent dependencies on system performance. Our approach differs from existing research by focusing on the interplay between memory constraints and noise management, providing insights into optimizing scalability and response times in environments with interdependent topics. Through this analysis, we offer a comprehensive understanding of how different configurations impact the efficiency of LLM-driven multi-agent systems, thereby guiding the design of more robust architectures.

Through detailed analysis of reasoning traces, we identify the most common failure modes and find several unwanted artifacts arising from the optimization strategies employed during model training. Overall, our results suggest that current LLMs are inadequate for rigorous mathematical reasoning tasks, highlighting the need for substantial improvements in reasoning and proof generation capabilities.

      Data augmentation is a critical component of deep learning pipelines, enhancing model generalization by increasing dataset diversity. Traditional augmentation strategies rely on manually designed transformations, stochastic sampling, or automated search-based approaches. Although automated methods improve performance, they often require extensive computational resources and are tailored to specific datasets. In this work, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-guided augmentation optimization strategy that refines augmentation policies based on model performance feedback. We introduce two approaches: (1) LLM-Guided Augmentation Policy Optimization, where augmentation policies are selected by an LLM prior to training and iteratively refined across multiple training cycles, and (2) Adaptive LLM-Guided Augmentation Policy Optimization, where policies adapt in real-time based on performance metrics. This in-training approach eliminates the need for full model retraining before receiving LLM feedback, thereby reducing computational costs while improving performance. Our methodology employs an LLM to dynamically select augmentation transformations based on dataset characteristics, model architecture, and prior training outcomes. Unlike traditional search-based methods, our approach leverages the contextual knowledge of LLMs, particularly in specialized domains like medical imaging, to recommend augmentation strategies tailored to domain-specific data. We evaluate our approach on multiple domain-specific image classification datasets where augmentation is key to model robustness. Results show that LLM-guided augmentation optimization outperforms traditional methods, improving model accuracy. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs in automating and adapting deep learning training workflows.

To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive e-commerce multi-task framework and design empirical experiments to examine the impact of diverse data and tasks on LLMs from two perspectives: "capability comprehensiveness" and "task comprehensiveness." Specifically, we observe significant improvements in LLM performance by progressively introducing tasks related to new major capability areas and by continuously adding subtasks within different major capability domains. Furthermore, we observe that increasing model capacity amplifies the benefits of diversity, suggesting a synergistic relationship between model capacity and data diversity. Finally, we validate the best-performing model from our empirical experiments in the KDD Cup 2024, achieving a rank 5 in Task 1.

      As Large Language Models (LLMs) more deeply integrate into human life across various regions, aligning them with pluralistic cultures is crucial for improving user experience and mitigating cultural conflicts. Existing approaches develop culturally aligned LLMs primarily through fine-tuning with massive carefully curated culture-specific corpora. Nevertheless, inspired by culture theories, we identify two key challenges faced by these datasets: (1) Representativeness: These corpora fail to fully capture the target culture's core characteristics with redundancy, causing computation waste; (2) Distinctiveness: They struggle to distinguish the unique nuances of a given culture from shared patterns across other relevant ones, hindering precise cultural modeling. To handle these challenges, we introduce CAReDiO, a novel cultural data construction framework. Specifically, CAReDiO utilizes powerful LLMs to automatically generate cultural conversation data, where both the queries and responses are further optimized by maximizing representativeness and distinctiveness. Using CAReDiO, we construct a small yet effective dataset, covering five cultures, and compare it with several recent cultural corpora. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generates more effective data and enables cultural alignment with as few as 100 training samples, enhancing both performance and efficiency.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have been applied to time series forecasting tasks, leveraging pre-trained language models as the backbone and incorporating textual data to purportedly enhance the comprehensive capabilities of LLMs for time series. However, are these texts really helpful for interpretation? This study seeks to investigate the actual efficacy and interpretability of such textual incorporations. Through a series of empirical experiments on textual prompts and textual prototypes, our findings reveal that the misalignment between two modalities exists, and the textual information does not significantly improve time series forecasting performance in many cases. Furthermore, visualization analysis indicates that the textual representations learned by existing frameworks lack sufficient interpretability when applied to time series data. We further propose a novel metric named Semantic Matching Index (SMI) to better evaluate the matching degree between time series and texts during our post hoc interpretability investigation. Our analysis reveals the misalignment and limited interpretability of texts in current time-series LLMs, and we hope this study can raise awareness of the interpretability of texts for time series.

      This study presents a comprehensive reproducibility and extension analysis of the Setwise prompting methodology for zero-shot ranking with Large Language Models (LLMs), as proposed by Zhuang et al. We evaluate its effectiveness and efficiency compared to traditional Pointwise, Pairwise, and Listwise approaches in document ranking tasks. Our reproduction confirms the findings of Zhuang et al., highlighting the trade-offs between computational efficiency and ranking effectiveness in Setwise methods. Building on these insights, we introduce Setwise Insertion, a novel approach that leverages the initial document ranking as prior knowledge, reducing unnecessary comparisons and uncertainty by focusing on candidates more likely to improve the ranking results. Experimental results across multiple LLM architectures (Flan-T5, Vicuna, and Llama) show that Setwise Insertion yields a 31% reduction in query time, a 23% reduction in model inferences, and a slight improvement in reranking effectiveness compared to the original Setwise method. These findings highlight the practical advantage of incorporating prior ranking knowledge into Setwise prompting for efficient and accurate zero-shot document reranking.

      Continual learning in large language models (LLMs) is prone to catastrophic forgetting, where adapting to new tasks significantly degrades performance on previously learned ones. Existing methods typically rely on low-rank, parameter-efficient updates that limit the model's expressivity and introduce additional parameters per task, leading to scalability issues. To address these limitations, we propose a novel continual full fine-tuning approach leveraging adaptive singular value decomposition (SVD). Our method dynamically identifies task-specific low-rank parameter subspaces and constrains updates to be orthogonal to critical directions associated with prior tasks, thus effectively minimizing interference without additional parameter overhead or storing previous task gradients. We evaluate our approach extensively on standard continual learning benchmarks using both encoder-decoder (T5-Large) and decoder-only (LLaMA-2 7B) models, spanning diverse tasks including classification, generation, and reasoning. Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, up to 7% higher average accuracy than recent baselines like O-LoRA, and notably maintains the model's general linguistic capabilities, instruction-following accuracy, and safety throughout the continual learning process by reducing forgetting to near-negligible levels. Our adaptive SVD framework effectively balances model plasticity and knowledge retention, providing a practical, theoretically grounded, and computationally scalable solution for continual learning scenarios in large language models.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to tackle increasingly complex tasks through advanced reasoning, long-form content generation, and tool use. Solving these tasks often involves long inference-time computations. In human problem solving, a common strategy to expedite work is collaboration: by dividing the problem into sub-tasks, exploring different strategies concurrently, etc. Recent research has shown that LLMs can also operate in parallel by implementing explicit cooperation frameworks, such as voting mechanisms or the explicit creation of independent sub-tasks that can be executed in parallel. However, each of these frameworks may not be suitable for all types of tasks, which can hinder their applicability. In this work, we propose a different design approach: we run LLM "workers" in parallel , allowing them to synchronize via a concurrently-updated attention cache and prompt these workers to decide how best to collaborate. Our approach allows the instances to come up with their own collaboration strategy for the problem at hand, all the while "seeing" each other's partial progress in the concurrent cache. We implement this approach via Hogwild! Inference: a parallel LLM inference engine where multiple instances of the same LLM run in parallel with the same attention cache, with "instant" access to each other's generated tokens. Hogwild! inference takes advantage of Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) to avoid recomputation while improving parallel hardware utilization. We find that modern reasoning-capable LLMs can perform inference with shared Key-Value cache out of the box, without additional fine-tuning.

      Uncertainty quantification (UQ) in Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for their safe and reliable deployment, particularly in critical applications where incorrect outputs can have serious consequences. Current UQ methods typically rely on querying the model multiple times using non-zero temperature sampling to generate diverse outputs for uncertainty estimation. However, the impact of selecting a given temperature parameter is understudied, and our analysis reveals that temperature plays a fundamental role in the quality of uncertainty estimates. The conventional approach of identifying optimal temperature values requires expensive hyperparameter optimization (HPO) that must be repeated for each new model-dataset combination. We propose Monte Carlo Temperature (MCT), a robust sampling strategy that eliminates the need for temperature calibration. Our analysis reveals that: 1) MCT provides more robust uncertainty estimates across a wide range of temperatures, 2) MCT improves the performance of UQ methods by replacing fixed-temperature strategies that do not rely on HPO, and 3) MCT achieves statistical parity with oracle temperatures, which represent the ideal outcome of a well-tuned but computationally expensive HPO process. These findings demonstrate that effective UQ can be achieved without the computational burden of temperature parameter calibration.

      As modern hardware designs grow in complexity and size, ensuring security across the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) triad becomes increasingly challenging. Information flow tracking (IFT) is a widely-used approach to tracing data propagation, identifying unauthorized activities that may compromise confidentiality or/and integrity in hardware. However, traditional IFT methods struggle with scalability and adaptability, particularly in high-density and interconnected architectures, leading to tracing bottlenecks that limit applicability in large-scale hardware. To address these limitations and show the potential of transformer-based models in integrated circuit (IC) design, this paper introduces LLM-IFT that integrates large language models (LLM) for the realization of the IFT process in hardware. LLM-IFT exploits LLM-driven structured reasoning to perform hierarchical dependency analysis, systematically breaking down even the most complex designs. Through a multi-step LLM invocation, the framework analyzes both intra-module and inter-module dependencies, enabling comprehensive IFT assessment. By focusing on a set of Trust-Hub vulnerability test cases at both the IP level and the SoC level, our experiments demonstrate a 100\% success rate in accurate IFT analysis for confidentiality and integrity checks in hardware.

      With the growing adoption of reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) for aligning large language models (LLMs), the risk of backdoor installation during alignment has increased, leading to unintended and harmful behaviors. Existing backdoor triggers are typically limited to fixed word patterns, making them detectable during data cleaning and easily removable post-poisoning. In this work, we explore the use of prompt-specific paraphrases as backdoor triggers, enhancing their stealth and resistance to removal during LLM alignment. We propose AdvBDGen, an adversarially fortified generative fine-tuning framework that automatically generates prompt-specific backdoors that are effective, stealthy, and transferable across models. AdvBDGen employs a generator-discriminator pair, fortified by an adversary, to ensure the installability and stealthiness of backdoors. It enables the crafting and successful installation of complex triggers using as little as 3% of the fine-tuning data. Once installed, these backdoors can jailbreak LLMs during inference, demonstrate improved stability against perturbations compared to traditional constant triggers, and are more challenging to remove. These findings underscore an urgent need for the research community to develop more robust defenses against adversarial backdoor threats in LLM alignment.

      Large language models (LLMs) have gained popularity in recent years for their utility in various applications. However, they are sensitive to non-semantic changes in prompt formats, where small changes in the prompt format can lead to significant performance fluctuations. In the literature, this problem is commonly referred to as prompt brittleness. Previous research on prompt engineering has focused mainly on developing techniques for identifying the optimal prompt for specific tasks. Some studies have also explored the issue of prompt brittleness and proposed methods to quantify performance variations; however, no simple solution has been found to address this challenge. We propose Mixture of Formats (MOF), a simple and efficient technique for addressing prompt brittleness in LLMs by diversifying the styles used in the prompt few-shot examples. MOF was inspired by computer vision techniques that utilize diverse style datasets to prevent models from associating specific styles with the target variable. Empirical results show that our proposed technique reduces style-induced prompt brittleness in various LLMs while also enhancing overall performance across prompt variations and different datasets.

      Optimal hyperparameter selection is critical for maximizing neural network performance, especially as models grow in complexity. This work investigates the viability of using large language models (LLMs) for hyperparameter optimization by employing a fine-tuned version of Code Llama. Through parameter-efficient fine-tuning using LoRA, we adapt the LLM to generate accurate and efficient hyperparameter recommendations tailored to diverse neural network architectures. Unlike traditional methods such as Optuna, which rely on exhaustive trials, the proposed approach achieves competitive or superior results in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) while significantly reducing computational overhead. Our approach highlights that LLM-based optimization not only matches state-of-the-art methods like Tree-structured Parzen Estimators but also accelerates the tuning process. This positions LLMs as a promising alternative to conventional optimization techniques, particularly for rapid experimentation. Furthermore, the ability to generate hyperparameters in a single inference step makes this method particularly well-suited for resource-constrained environments such as edge devices and mobile applications, where computational efficiency is paramount. The results confirm that LLMs, beyond their efficiency, offer substantial time savings and comparable stability, underscoring their value in advancing machine learning workflows. All generated hyperparameters are included in the LEMUR Neural Network (NN) Dataset, which is publicly available and serves as an open-source benchmark for hyperparameter optimization research.

Our method employs a Language-to-Distribution~(L2D) module to translate contextual information into predictive disturbance trajectories, which are then incorporated into the MPC optimization. Unlike existing context-aware and language-based MPC models, \IMPC enables dynamic human-LLM interaction and fine-tunes the L2D module in a closed loop with theoretical performance guarantees, achieving a regret bound of $O(\sqrt{T\log T})$ for linear dynamics when optimized via advanced fine-tuning methods such as Direct Preference Optimization~(DPO) using a tailored loss function.

Method: We collected 189 videos from 2022 to 2024 from practitioners actively developing such systems and discussing various aspects they encounter during development and deployment of LLMs in production. We analyzed the transcripts using BERTopic, then manually sorted and merged the generated topics into themes, leading to a total of 20 topics in 8 themes.

Other frequently discussed topics include model capabilities and enhancement techniques (e.g., fine-tuning, prompt engineering), infrastructure and tooling, and risks and ethical challenges. Implications: Our results highlight current discussions and challenges in deploying LLMs in production.

      Data augmentation is a critical component of deep learning pipelines, enhancing model generalization by increasing dataset diversity. Traditional augmentation strategies rely on manually designed transformations, stochastic sampling, or automated search-based approaches. Although automated methods improve performance, they often require extensive computational resources and are tailored to specific datasets. In this work, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-guided augmentation optimization strategy that refines augmentation policies based on model performance feedback. We introduce two approaches: (1) LLM-Guided Augmentation Policy Optimization, where augmentation policies are selected by an LLM prior to training and iteratively refined across multiple training cycles, and (2) Adaptive LLM-Guided Augmentation Policy Optimization, where policies adapt in real-time based on performance metrics. This in-training approach eliminates the need for full model retraining before receiving LLM feedback, thereby reducing computational costs while improving performance. Our methodology employs an LLM to dynamically select augmentation transformations based on dataset characteristics, model architecture, and prior training outcomes. Unlike traditional search-based methods, our approach leverages the contextual knowledge of LLMs, particularly in specialized domains like medical imaging, to recommend augmentation strategies tailored to domain-specific data. We evaluate our approach on multiple domain-specific image classification datasets where augmentation is key to model robustness. Results show that LLM-guided augmentation optimization outperforms traditional methods, improving model accuracy. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs in automating and adapting deep learning training workflows.

      Aligning large language models (LLMs) through supervised fine-tuning is essential for tailoring them to specific applications. Recent studies suggest that alignment primarily adjusts a model's presentation style rather than its foundational knowledge, indicating that only certain components of the model are significantly impacted. To uncover how alignment affects model behavior at a granular level, we propose identifying which layers within LLMs are most critical to the alignment process. Our approach, named ILA, involves learning a binary mask for the parameter changes in each layer during alignment, as an indicator of layer significance. Experimental results reveal that, despite substantial differences in alignment datasets, the important layers of a model identified by ILA exhibit nearly 90\% overlap, highlighting fundamental patterns in LLM alignment. The results also indicate that freezing non-essential layers improves overall model performance, while selectively tuning the most critical layers significantly enhances fine-tuning efficiency with minimal performance loss. Finally, we discuss how these findings extend from LLM alignment to reasoning.

      Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on preference alignment methods to steer outputs toward human values, yet these methods are often constrained by the scarcity of high-quality human-annotated data. To tackle this, recent approaches have turned to synthetic data generated by LLMs as a scalable alternative. However, synthetic data can introduce distribution shifts, compromising the nuanced human preferences that are essential for desirable outputs. In this paper, we propose a novel distribution-aware optimization framework that improves preference alignment in the presence of such shifts. Our approach first estimates the likelihood ratios between the target and training distributions leveraging a learned classifier, then it minimizes the worst-case loss over data regions that reflect the target human-preferred distribution. By explicitly prioritizing the target distribution during optimization, our method mitigates the adverse effects of distributional variation and enhances the generation of responses that faithfully reflect human values.

      While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in challenging tasks such as mathematical reasoning, existing methods to enhance reasoning ability predominantly rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by reinforcement learning (RL) on reasoning-specific data after pre-training. However, these approaches critically depend on external supervisions--such as human labelled reasoning traces, verified golden answers, or pre-trained reward models--which limits scalability and practical applicability. In this work, we propose Entropy Minimized Policy Optimization (EMPO), which makes an early attempt at fully unsupervised LLM reasoning incentivization. EMPO does not require any supervised information for incentivizing reasoning capabilities (i.e., neither verifiable reasoning traces, problems with golden answers, nor additional pre-trained reward models). By continuously minimizing the predictive entropy of LLMs on unlabeled user queries in a latent semantic space, EMPO enables purely self-supervised evolution of reasoning capabilities with strong flexibility and practicality. Our experiments demonstrate competitive performance of EMPO on both mathematical reasoning and free-form commonsense reasoning tasks. Specifically, without any supervised signals, EMPO boosts the accuracy of Qwen2.5-Math-7B Base from 30.7\% to 48.1\% on mathematical benchmarks and improves truthfulness accuracy of Qwen2.5-7B Instruct from 87.16\% to 97.25\% on TruthfulQA.

      Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly contributing to the creation of content on the Internet. This creates a feedback loop as subsequent generations of models will be trained on this generated, synthetic data. This phenomenon is receiving increasing interest, in particular because previous studies have shown that it may lead to distribution shift - models misrepresent and forget the true underlying distributions of human data they are expected to approximate (e.g. resulting in a drastic loss of quality). In this study, we study the impact of human data properties on distribution shift dynamics in iterated training loops. We first confirm that the distribution shift dynamics greatly vary depending on the human data by comparing four datasets (two based on Twitter and two on Reddit). We then test whether data quality may influence the rate of this shift. We find that it does on the twitter, but not on the Reddit datasets. We then focus on a Reddit dataset and conduct a more exhaustive evaluation of a large set of dataset properties. This experiment associated lexical diversity with larger, and semantic diversity with smaller detrimental shifts, suggesting that incorporating text with high lexical (but limited semantic) diversity could exacerbate the degradation of generated text. We then focus on the evolution of political bias, and find that the type of shift observed (bias reduction, amplification or inversion) depends on the political lean of the human (true) distribution. Overall, our work extends the existing literature on the consequences of recursive fine-tuning by showing that this phenomenon is highly dependent on features of the human data on which training occurs. This suggests that different parts of internet (e.g. GitHub, Reddit) may undergo different types of shift depending on their properties.

      The integration of large language models (LLMs) into information retrieval systems introduces new attack surfaces, particularly for adversarial ranking manipulations. We present StealthRank, a novel adversarial ranking attack that manipulates LLM-driven product recommendation systems while maintaining textual fluency and stealth. Unlike existing methods that often introduce detectable anomalies, StealthRank employs an energy-based optimization framework combined with Langevin dynamics to generate StealthRank Prompts (SRPs)-adversarial text sequences embedded within product descriptions that subtly yet effectively influence LLM ranking mechanisms. We evaluate StealthRank across multiple LLMs, demonstrating its ability to covertly boost the ranking of target products while avoiding explicit manipulation traces that can be easily detected. Our results show that StealthRank consistently outperforms state-of-the-art adversarial ranking baselines in both effectiveness and stealth, highlighting critical vulnerabilities in LLM-driven recommendation systems.

      3D spatial understanding is essential in real-world applications such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, virtual reality, and medical imaging. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs), having demonstrated remarkable success across various domains, have been leveraged to enhance 3D understanding tasks, showing potential to surpass traditional computer vision methods. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of methods integrating LLMs with 3D spatial understanding. We propose a taxonomy that categorizes existing methods into three branches: image-based methods deriving 3D understanding from 2D visual data, point cloud-based methods working directly with 3D representations, and hybrid modality-based methods combining multiple data streams. We systematically review representative methods along these categories, covering data representations, architectural modifications, and training strategies that bridge textual and 3D modalities. Finally, we discuss current limitations, including dataset scarcity and computational challenges, while highlighting promising research directions in spatial perception, multi-modal fusion, and real-world applications.

      Embedding fusion has emerged as an effective approach for enhancing performance across various NLP tasks. However, systematic guidelines for selecting optimal layers and developing effective fusion strategies for the integration of LLMs remain underexplored. In this study, we propose a layer-aware embedding selection method and investigate how to quantitatively evaluate different layers to identify the most important ones for downstream NLP tasks, showing that the critical layers vary depending on the dataset. We also explore how combining embeddings from multiple LLMs, without requiring model fine-tuning, can improve performance. Experiments on four English text classification datasets (SST-2, MR, R8, and R52) demonstrate that different layers in LLMs exhibit varying degrees of representational strength for classification, and that combining embeddings from different models can enhance performance if the models exhibit complementary characteristics. Additionally, we discuss resources overhead (memory and inference time) to provide a balanced perspective on the real world feasibility of embedding fusion. Future work will explore multilingual and domain specific datasets, as well as techniques for automating layer selection, to improve both performance and scalability.

      Cloud applications heavily rely on APIs to communicate with each other and exchange data. To ensure the reliability of cloud applications, cloud providers widely adopt API testing techniques. Unfortunately, existing API testing approaches are insufficient to reach strict conditions, a problem known as fitness plateaus, due to the lack of gradient provided by coverage metrics. To address this issue, we propose MioHint, a novel white-box API testing approach that leverages the code comprehension capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM) to boost API testing. The key challenge of LLM-based API testing lies in system-level testing, which emphasizes the dependencies between requests and targets across functions and files, thereby making the entire codebase the object of analysis. However, feeding the entire codebase to an LLM is impractical due to its limited context length and short memory. MioHint addresses this challenge by synergizing static analysis with LLMs. We retrieve relevant code with data-dependency analysis at the statement level, including def-use analysis for variables used in the target and function expansion for subfunctions called by the target. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted experiments across 16 real-world REST API services. The findings reveal that MioHint achieves an average increase of 4.95% absolute in line coverage compared to the baseline, EvoMaster, alongside a remarkable factor of 67x improvement in mutation accuracy. Furthermore, our method successfully covers over 57% of hard-to-cover targets while in baseline the coverage is less than 10%.

      Long-form generation is crucial for a wide range of practical applications, typically categorized into short-to-long and long-to-long generation. While short-to-long generations have received considerable attention, generating long texts from extremely long resources remains relatively underexplored. The primary challenge in long-to-long generation lies in effectively integrating and analyzing relevant information from extensive inputs, which remains difficult for current large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we propose LLM$\times$MapReduce-V2, a novel test-time scaling strategy designed to enhance the ability of LLMs to process extremely long inputs. Drawing inspiration from convolutional neural networks, which iteratively integrate local features into higher-level global representations, LLM$\times$MapReduce-V2 utilizes stacked convolutional scaling layers to progressively expand the understanding of input materials. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate that our approach substantially enhances the ability of LLMs to process long inputs and generate coherent, informative long-form articles, outperforming several representative baselines.

StateAct outperforms ReAct, the previous best base agent, by over 10% on Alfworld, 30% on Textcraft, and 7% on Webshop across multiple frontier LLMs. We also demonstrate that StateAct can be used as a drop-in replacement for ReAct with advanced LLM agent methods such as test-time scaling, yielding an additional 12% gain on Textcraft. By improving efficiency and long-range reasoning without requiring additional training or retrieval, StateAct provides a scalable foundation for LLM agents.

      We explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated assessment of open-text student reflections and prediction of academic performance. Traditional methods for evaluating reflections are time-consuming and may not scale effectively in educational settings. In this work, we employ LLMs to transform student reflections into quantitative scores using two assessment strategies (single-agent and multi-agent) and two prompting techniques (zero-shot and few-shot). Our experiments, conducted on a dataset of 5,278 reflections from 377 students over three academic terms, demonstrate that the single-agent with few-shot strategy achieves the highest match rate with human evaluations. Furthermore, models utilizing LLM-assessed reflection scores outperform baselines in both at-risk student identification and grade prediction tasks. These findings suggest that LLMs can effectively automate reflection assessment, reduce educators' workload, and enable timely support for students who may need additional assistance. Our work emphasizes the potential of integrating advanced generative AI technologies into educational practices to enhance student engagement and academic success.

      Deep learning (e.g., Transformer) has been widely and successfully used in multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF). Unlike existing methods that focus on training models from a single modal of time series input, large language models (LLMs) based MTSF methods with cross-modal text and time series input have recently shown great superiority, especially with limited temporal data. However, current LLM-based MTSF methods usually focus on adapting and fine-tuning LLMs, while neglecting the distribution discrepancy between textual and temporal input tokens, thus leading to sub-optimal performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel Cross-Modal LLM Fine-Tuning (CALF) framework for MTSF by reducing the distribution discrepancy between textual and temporal data, which mainly consists of the temporal target branch with temporal input and the textual source branch with aligned textual input. To reduce the distribution discrepancy, we develop the cross-modal match module to first align cross-modal input distributions. Additionally, to minimize the modality distribution gap in both feature and output spaces, feature regularization loss is developed to align the intermediate features between the two branches for better weight updates, while output consistency loss is introduced to allow the output representations of both branches to correspond effectively. Thanks to the modality alignment, CALF establishes state-of-the-art performance for both long-term and short-term forecasting tasks with low computational complexity, and exhibiting favorable few-shot and zero-shot abilities similar to that in LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/Hank0626/LLaTA.

Our findings reveal that pre-trained LLMs, particularly GPT-4 Turbo and GPT-3.5 Turbo, exhibit commendable performance and are capable of producing evaluations comparable to those of expert human evaluators. Although these LLMs demonstrate proficiency in providing scores comparable to human experts in terms of human evaluation metrics, they frequently fail to identify errors and offer specific actionable advice for candidate performance improvement in HR interviews. Our research suggests that the current state-of-the-art pre-trained LLMs are not fully conducive for automatic deployment in an HR interview assessment. Instead, our findings advocate for a human-in-the-loop approach, to incorporate manual checks for inconsistencies and provisions for improving feedback quality as a more suitable strategy.

      As short videos have risen in popularity, the role of video content in advertising has become increasingly significant. Typically, advertisers record a large amount of raw footage about the product and then create numerous different short-form advertisement videos based on this raw footage. Creating such videos mainly involves editing raw footage and writing advertisement scripts, which requires a certain level of creative ability. It is usually challenging to create many different video contents for the same product, and manual efficiency is often low. In this paper, we present VC-LLM, a framework powered by Large Language Models for the automatic creation of high-quality short-form advertisement videos. Our approach leverages high-resolution spatial input and low-resolution temporal input to represent video clips more effectively, capturing both fine-grained visual details and broader temporal dynamics. In addition, during training, we incorporate supplementary information generated by rewriting the ground truth text, ensuring that all key output information can be directly traced back to the input, thereby reducing model hallucinations. We also designed a benchmark to evaluate the quality of the created videos. Experiments show that VC-LLM based on GPT-4o can produce videos comparable to those created by humans. Furthermore, we collected numerous high-quality short advertisement videos to create a pre-training dataset and manually cleaned a portion of the data to construct a high-quality fine-tuning dataset. Experiments indicate that, on the benchmark, the VC-LLM based on fine-tuned LLM can produce videos with superior narrative logic compared to those created by the VC-LLM based on GPT-4o.

      Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized for complex tasks requiring longer context lengths, with some models supporting up to 128K or 1M tokens. This trend, however, presents significant challenges in inference speed and memory management. Quantization emerges as a promising approach to address the widening gap between LLM size and memory capacity. However, traditional quantization schemes often yield suboptimal compression results for KV caches due to two key factors: i) On-the-fly quantization and de-quantization, causing significant performance overhead; ii) Prevalence of outliers in KV values, challenging low-bitwidth uniform quantization. To this end, we propose MILLION, a novel quantization framework achieving low-bitwidth KV cache through product quantization. First, we conduct a thorough analysis of KV cache distribution, revealing the limitations of existing quantization schemes. Second, we introduce a non-uniform quantization algorithm based on product quantization, which efficiently compresses data while preserving accuracy. Third, we develop a high-performance GPU inference framework with efficient attention kernel and pipeline design for MILLION that leverages sparse computation and asynchronous quantization, significantly enhancing inference speed. Comprehensive evaluation results demonstrate that MILLION can achieve 4 bits quantization with trivial perplexity and accuracy loss, and achieve 2.09x end-to-end performance gains at 32K context length.

      Recent advancements in rule-based reinforcement learning (RL), applied during the post-training phase of large language models (LLMs), have significantly enhanced their capabilities in structured reasoning tasks such as mathematics and logical inference. However, the effectiveness of RL in social reasoning, particularly in Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to infer others' mental states, remains largely unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that RL methods effectively unlock ToM reasoning capabilities even in small-scale LLMs (0.5B to 7B parameters). Using a modest dataset comprising 3200 questions across diverse scenarios, our RL-trained 7B model achieves 84.50\% accuracy on the Hi-ToM benchmark, surpassing models like GPT-4o and DeepSeek-v3 despite significantly fewer parameters. While smaller models ($\leq$3B parameters) suffer from reasoning collapse, larger models (7B parameters) maintain stable performance through consistent belief tracking. Additionally, our RL-based models demonstrate robust generalization to higher-order, out-of-distribution ToM problems, novel textual presentations, and previously unseen datasets. These findings highlight RL's potential to enhance social cognitive reasoning, bridging the gap between structured problem-solving and nuanced social inference in LLMs.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly integral to a wide range of applications. However, they still remain the threat of jailbreak attacks, where attackers manipulate designed prompts to make the models elicit malicious outputs. Analyzing jailbreak methods can help us delve into the weakness of LLMs and improve it. In this paper, We reveal a vulnerability in large language models (LLMs), which we term Defense Threshold Decay (DTD), by analyzing the attention weights of the model's output on input and subsequent output on prior output: as the model generates substantial benign content, its attention weights shift from the input to prior output, making it more susceptible to jailbreak attacks. To demonstrate the exploitability of DTD, we propose a novel jailbreak attack method, Sugar-Coated Poison (SCP), which induces the model to generate substantial benign content through benign input and adversarial reasoning, subsequently producing malicious content. To mitigate such attacks, we introduce a simple yet effective defense strategy, POSD, which significantly reduces jailbreak success rates while preserving the model's generalization capabilities.

      Retrieval models typically rely on costly human-labeled query-document relevance annotations for training and evaluation. To reduce this cost and leverage the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in relevance judgments, we aim to explore whether LLM-generated annotations can effectively replace human annotations in training retrieval models. Retrieval usually emphasizes relevance, which indicates "topic-relatedness" of a document to a query, while in RAG, the value of a document (or utility) depends on how it contributes to answer generation. Recognizing this mismatch, some researchers use LLM performance on downstream tasks with documents as labels, but this approach requires manual answers for specific tasks, leading to high costs and limited generalization. In another line of work, prompting LLMs to select useful documents as RAG references eliminates the need for human annotation and is not task-specific. If we leverage LLMs' utility judgments to annotate retrieval data, we may retain cross-task generalization without human annotation in large-scale corpora. Therefore, we investigate utility-focused annotation via LLMs for large-scale retriever training data across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings on the retrieval and RAG tasks. To reduce the impact of low-quality positives labeled by LLMs, we design a novel loss function, i.e., Disj-InfoNCE. Our experiments reveal that: (1) Retrievers trained on utility-focused annotations significantly outperform those trained on human annotations in the out-of-domain setting on both tasks, demonstrating superior generalization capabilities. (2) LLM annotation does not replace human annotation in the in-domain setting. However, incorporating just 20% human-annotated data enables retrievers trained with utility-focused annotations to match the performance of models trained entirely with human annotations.

In this paper, we build on this idea by extending the refinement from sentence-level to document-level translation, specifically focusing on document-to-document (Doc2Doc) translation refinement. Since sentence-to-sentence (Sent2Sent) and Doc2Doc translation address different aspects of the translation process, we propose fine-tuning LLMs for translation refinement using two intermediate translations, combining the strengths of both Sent2Sent and Doc2Doc. Additionally, recognizing that the quality of intermediate translations varies, we introduce an enhanced fine-tuning method with quality awareness that assigns lower weights to easier translations and higher weights to more difficult ones, enabling the model to focus on challenging translation cases. Experimental results across ten translation tasks with LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct and Mistral-Nemo-Instruct demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

      Extractive reading comprehension systems are designed to locate the correct answer to a question within a given text. However, a persistent challenge lies in ensuring these models maintain high accuracy in answering questions while reliably recognizing unanswerable queries. Despite significant advances in large language models (LLMs) for reading comprehension, this issue remains critical, particularly as the length of supported contexts continues to expand. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative data augmentation methodology grounded in a multi-agent collaborative framework. Unlike traditional methods, such as the costly human annotation process required for datasets like SQuAD 2.0, our method autonomously generates evidence-based question-answer pairs and systematically constructs unanswerable questions. Using this methodology, we developed the FactGuard-Bench dataset, which comprises 25,220 examples of both answerable and unanswerable question scenarios, with context lengths ranging from 8K to 128K. Experimental evaluations conducted on seven popular LLMs reveal that even the most advanced models achieve only 61.79% overall accuracy. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of a model's ability to reason about unanswerable questions to avoid generating plausible but incorrect answers. By implementing efficient data selection and generation within the multi-agent collaborative framework, our method significantly reduces the traditionally high costs associated with manual annotation and provides valuable insights for the training and optimization of LLMs.

      Chain-of-Thought (CoT) enhances an LLM's ability to perform complex reasoning tasks, but it also introduces new security issues. In this work, we present ShadowCoT, a novel backdoor attack framework that targets the internal reasoning mechanism of LLMs. Unlike prior token-level or prompt-based attacks, ShadowCoT directly manipulates the model's cognitive reasoning path, enabling it to hijack multi-step reasoning chains and produce logically coherent but adversarial outcomes. By conditioning on internal reasoning states, ShadowCoT learns to recognize and selectively disrupt key reasoning steps, effectively mounting a self-reflective cognitive attack within the target model. Our approach introduces a lightweight yet effective multi-stage injection pipeline, which selectively rewires attention pathways and perturbs intermediate representations with minimal parameter overhead (only 0.15% updated). ShadowCoT further leverages reinforcement learning and reasoning chain pollution (RCP) to autonomously synthesize stealthy adversarial CoTs that remain undetectable to advanced defenses. Extensive experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks and LLMs show that ShadowCoT consistently achieves high Attack Success Rate (94.4%) and Hijacking Success Rate (88.4%) while preserving benign performance. These results reveal an emergent class of cognition-level threats and highlight the urgent need for defenses beyond shallow surface-level consistency.

      We introduce RadA-BenchPlat, an evaluation platform that benchmarks the performance of large language models (LLMs) act as agent cores in radiology environments using 2,200 radiologist-verified synthetic patient records covering six anatomical regions, five imaging modalities, and 2,200 disease scenarios, resulting in 24,200 question-answer pairs that simulate diverse clinical situations. The platform also defines ten categories of tools for agent-driven task solving and evaluates seven leading LLMs, revealing that while models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet can achieve a 67.1% task completion rate in routine settings, they still struggle with complex task understanding and tool coordination, limiting their capacity to serve as the central core of automated radiology systems. By incorporating four advanced prompt engineering strategies--where prompt-backpropagation and multi-agent collaboration contributed 16.8% and 30.7% improvements, respectively--the performance for complex tasks was enhanced by 48.2% overall. Furthermore, automated tool building was explored to improve robustness, achieving a 65.4% success rate, thereby offering promising insights for the future integration of fully automated radiology applications into clinical practice. All of our code and data are openly available at https://github.com/MAGIC-AI4Med/RadABench.
