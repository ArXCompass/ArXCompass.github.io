      Large Language Models (LLMs) effectively leverage common-sense knowledge for general reasoning, yet they struggle with personalized reasoning when tasked with interpreting multifactor personal data. This limitation restricts their applicability in domains that require context-aware decision-making tailored to individuals. This paper introduces Personalized Causal Graph Reasoning as an agentic framework that enhances LLM reasoning by incorporating personal causal graphs derived from data of individuals. These graphs provide a foundation that guides the LLM's reasoning process. We evaluate it on a case study on nutrient-oriented dietary recommendations, which requires personal reasoning due to the implicit unique dietary effects. We propose a counterfactual evaluation to estimate the efficiency of LLM-recommended foods for glucose management. Results demonstrate that the proposed method efficiently provides personalized dietary recommendations to reduce average glucose iAUC across three time windows, which outperforms the previous approach. LLM-as-a-judge evaluation results indicate that our proposed method enhances personalization in the reasoning process.

      Although large language models demonstrate strong performance across various domains, they still struggle with numerous bad cases in mathematical reasoning. Previous approaches to learning from errors synthesize training data by solely extrapolating from isolated bad cases, thereby failing to generalize the extensive patterns inherent within these cases. This paper presents Self-Error-Instruct (SEI), a framework that addresses these model weaknesses and synthesizes more generalized targeted training data. Specifically, we explore a target model on two mathematical datasets, GSM8K and MATH, to pinpoint bad cases. Then, we generate error keyphrases for these cases based on the instructor model's (GPT-4o) analysis and identify error types by clustering these keyphrases. Next, we sample a few bad cases during each generation for each identified error type and input them into the instructor model, which synthesizes additional training data using a self-instruct approach. This new data is refined through a one-shot learning process to ensure that only the most effective examples are kept. Finally, we use these curated data to fine-tune the target model, iteratively repeating the process to enhance performance. We apply our framework to various models and observe improvements in their reasoning abilities across both in-domain and out-of-domain mathematics datasets. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of self-error instruction in improving LLMs' mathematical reasoning through error generalization.

      Continually expanding new languages for existing large language models (LLMs) is a promising yet challenging approach to building powerful multilingual LLMs. The biggest challenge is to make the model continuously learn new languages while preserving the proficient ability of old languages. To achieve this, recent work utilizes the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture to expand new languages by adding new experts and avoid catastrophic forgetting of old languages by routing corresponding tokens to the original model backbone (old experts). Although intuitive, this kind of method is parameter-costly when expanding new languages and still inevitably impacts the performance of old languages. To address these limitations, we analyze the language characteristics of different layers in LLMs and propose a layer-wise expert allocation algorithm (LayerMoE) to determine the appropriate number of new experts for each layer. Specifically, we find different layers in LLMs exhibit different representation similarities between languages and then utilize the similarity as the indicator to allocate experts for each layer, i.e., the higher similarity, the fewer experts. Additionally, to further mitigate the forgetting of old languages, we add a classifier in front of the router network on the layers with higher similarity to guide the routing of old language tokens. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art baseline with 60% fewer experts in the single-expansion setting and with 33.3% fewer experts in the lifelong-expansion setting, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.

      This paper presents a novel approach for unified retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems using the recent emerging large language model (LLM) agent concept. Specifically, Agent LLM, which utilizes LLM as fundamental controllers, has become a promising approach to enable the interpretability of RAG tasks, especially for complex reasoning question-answering systems (e.g., multi-hop queries). Nonetheless, previous works mainly focus on solving RAG systems with either single-hop or multi-hop approaches separately, which limits the application of those approaches to real-world applications. In this study, we propose a trainable agent framework called Agent-UniRAG for unified retrieval-augmented LLM systems, which enhances the effectiveness and interpretability of RAG systems. The main idea is to design an LLM agent framework to solve RAG tasks step-by-step based on the complexity of the inputs, simultaneously including single-hop and multi-hop queries in an end-to-end manner. Furthermore, we introduce SynAgent-RAG, a synthetic dataset to enable the proposed agent framework for small open-source LLMs (e.g., Llama-3-8B). The results show comparable performances with closed-source and larger open-source LLMs across various RAG benchmarks. Our source code and dataset are publicly available for further exploitation.

      Integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is an emerging research challenge in claim verification. While KGs provide structured, semantically rich representations well-suited for reasoning, most existing verification methods rely on unstructured text corpora, limiting their ability to effectively leverage KGs. Additionally, despite possessing strong reasoning abilities, modern LLMs struggle with multi-step modular pipelines and reasoning over KGs without adaptation. To address these challenges, we propose ClaimPKG, an end-to-end framework that seamlessly integrates LLM reasoning with structured knowledge from KGs. Specifically, the main idea of ClaimPKG is to employ a lightweight, specialized LLM to represent the input claim as pseudo-subgraphs, guiding a dedicated subgraph retrieval module to identify relevant KG subgraphs. These retrieved subgraphs are then processed by a general-purpose LLM to produce the final verdict and justification. Extensive experiments on the FactKG dataset demonstrate that ClaimPKG achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines in this research field by 9%-12% accuracy points across multiple categories. Furthermore, ClaimPKG exhibits zero-shot generalizability to unstructured datasets such as HoVer and FEVEROUS, effectively combining structured knowledge from KGs with LLM reasoning across various LLM backbones.

      Emotion understanding includes basic tasks (e.g., sentiment/emotion classification) and advanced tasks (e.g., sarcasm/humor detection). Current methods rely on fixed-length CoT reasoning, failing to adapt to the varying complexity of emotions. We propose a task-adaptive reasoning framework that employs DeepSeek-R1 to generate variable-length reasoning chains for different emotion tasks. By combining fine-tuning with reinforcement learning, we design a composite reward function that balances four objectives: prediction accuracy, adaptive reasoning depth control, structural diversity in reasoning paths, and suppression of repetitive logic. This approach achieves dynamic context-sensitive inference while enabling LLMs to autonomously develop deep reasoning capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements in both Acc and F1 scores across four tasks: emotion, sentiment, humor, and sarcasm. Notably, peak enhancements reached 3.56% F1 (2.76% Acc) for basic tasks and 37.95% F1 (23.14% Acc) for advanced tasks. Our work bridges rigid CoT reasoning and emotional complexity through adaptive-depth analysis.

      Limited access to mental healthcare, extended wait times, and increasing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led individuals to turn to LLMs for fulfilling their mental health needs. However, examining the multi-turn mental health conversation capabilities of LLMs remains under-explored. Existing evaluation frameworks typically focus on diagnostic accuracy and win-rates and often overlook alignment with patient-specific goals, values, and personalities required for meaningful conversations. To address this, we introduce MedAgent, a novel framework for synthetically generating realistic, multi-turn mental health sensemaking conversations and use it to create the Mental Health Sensemaking Dialogue (MHSD) dataset, comprising over 2,200 patient-LLM conversations. Additionally, we present MultiSenseEval, a holistic framework to evaluate the multi-turn conversation abilities of LLMs in healthcare settings using human-centric criteria. Our findings reveal that frontier reasoning models yield below-par performance for patient-centric communication and struggle at advanced diagnostic capabilities with average score of 31%. Additionally, we observed variation in model performance based on patient's persona and performance drop with increasing turns in the conversation. Our work provides a comprehensive synthetic data generation framework, a dataset and evaluation framework for assessing LLMs in multi-turn mental health conversations.

      Rigorous statistical evaluations of large language models (LLMs), including valid error bars and significance testing, are essential for meaningful and reliable performance assessment. Currently, when such statistical measures are reported, they typically rely on the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). In this position paper, we argue that while CLT-based methods for uncertainty quantification are appropriate when benchmarks consist of thousands of examples, they fail to provide adequate uncertainty estimates for LLM evaluations that rely on smaller, highly specialized benchmarks. In these small-data settings, we demonstrate that CLT-based methods perform very poorly, usually dramatically underestimating uncertainty (i.e. producing error bars that are too small). We give recommendations for alternative frequentist and Bayesian methods that are both easy to implement and more appropriate in these increasingly common scenarios. We provide a simple Python library for these Bayesian methods at https://github.com/sambowyer/bayes_evals .

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      ``Socrates is human. All humans are mortal. Therefore, Socrates is mortal.'' This form of argument illustrates a typical pattern of two-hop reasoning. Formally, two-hop reasoning refers to the process of inferring a conclusion by making two logical steps, each connecting adjacent concepts, such that the final conclusion depends on the integration of both steps. It is one of the most fundamental components of human reasoning and plays a crucial role in both formal logic and everyday decision-making. Despite recent progress in large language models (LLMs), we surprisingly find that they can fail at solving simple two-hop reasoning problems when distractors are present. We observe on a synthetic dataset that pre-trained LLMs often resort to random guessing among all plausible conclusions. However, after few steps of fine-tuning, models achieve near-perfect accuracy and exhibit strong length generalization. To understand the underlying mechanisms, we train a 3-layer Transformer from scratch on a synthetic two-hop reasoning task and reverse-engineer its internal information flow. We observe a clear progression in the attention logits throughout training. This pictures a sharp phase transition from an initial stage of random guessing to the emergence of a structured sequential query mechanism, where the model first retrieves the preceding and the bridge concepts in the early layers and then uses them to infer the final answer. Finally, we show that these dynamics can be captured by a minimal three-parameter attention-only network.

      Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is an essential benefit support system provided by the US administration to 41 million federally determined low-income applicants. Through interviews with such applicants across a diverse set of experiences with the SNAP system, our findings reveal that new AI technologies like LLMs can alleviate traditional burdens but also introduce new burdens. We introduce new types of learning, compliance, and psychological costs that transform the administrative burden on applicants. We also identify how trust in AI across three dimensions--competence, integrity, and benevolence--is perceived to reduce administrative burdens, which may stem from unintended and untoward overt trust in the system. We discuss calibrating appropriate levels of user trust in LLM-based administrative systems, mitigating newly introduced burdens. In particular, our findings suggest that evidence-based information disclosure is necessary in benefits administration and propose directions for future research on trust-burden dynamics in AI-assisted administration systems.

      The emergence of agentic recommender systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) represents a paradigm shift in personalized recommendations, leveraging LLMs' advanced reasoning and role-playing capabilities to enable autonomous, adaptive decision-making. Unlike traditional recommendation approaches, agentic recommender systems can dynamically gather and interpret user-item interactions from complex environments, generating robust recommendation strategies that generalize across diverse scenarios. However, the field currently lacks standardized evaluation protocols to systematically assess these methods. To address this critical gap, we propose: (1) an interactive textual recommendation simulator incorporating rich user and item metadata and three typical evaluation scenarios (classic, evolving-interest, and cold-start recommendation tasks); (2) a unified modular framework for developing and studying agentic recommender systems; and (3) the first comprehensive benchmark comparing 10 classical and agentic recommendation methods. Our findings demonstrate the superiority of agentic systems and establish actionable design guidelines for their core components. The benchmark environment has been rigorously validated through an open challenge and remains publicly available with a continuously maintained leaderboard~\footnote[2]{https://tsinghua-fib-lab.github.io/AgentSocietyChallenge/pages/overview.html}, fostering ongoing community engagement and reproducible research.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      While large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis through discrete tokenization paradigms, current architectures exhibit fundamental tensions between three critical dimensions: 1) irreversible loss of acoustic characteristics caused by quantization of speech prompts; 2) stringent dependence on precisely aligned prompt speech-text pairs that limit real-world deployment; and 3) catastrophic forgetting of the LLM's native text comprehension during optimization for speech token generation. To address these challenges, we propose an LLM-based text-to-speech Generation approach Optimized via a novel dual-branch ArchiTecture (GOAT-TTS). Our framework introduces two key innovations: (1) The modality-alignment branch combines a speech encoder and projector to capture continuous acoustic embeddings, enabling bidirectional correlation between paralinguistic features (language, timbre, emotion) and semantic text representations without transcript dependency; (2) The speech-generation branch employs modular fine-tuning on top-k layers of an LLM for speech token prediction while freezing the bottom-n layers to preserve foundational linguistic knowledge. Moreover, multi-token prediction is introduced to support real-time streaming TTS synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that our GOAT-TTS achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art TTS models while validating the efficacy of synthesized dialect speech data.

      This work presents Pangu Embedded, an efficient Large Language Model (LLM) reasoner developed on Ascend Neural Processing Units (NPUs), featuring flexible fast and slow thinking capabilities. Pangu Embedded addresses the significant computational costs and inference latency challenges prevalent in existing reasoning-optimized LLMs. We propose a two-stage training framework for its construction. In Stage 1, the model is finetuned via an iterative distillation process, incorporating inter-iteration model merging to effectively aggregate complementary knowledge. This is followed by reinforcement learning on Ascend clusters, optimized by a latency-tolerant scheduler that combines stale synchronous parallelism with prioritized data queues. The RL process is guided by a Multi-source Adaptive Reward System (MARS), which generates dynamic, task-specific reward signals using deterministic metrics and lightweight LLM evaluators for mathematics, coding, and general problem-solving tasks. Stage 2 introduces a dual-system framework, endowing Pangu Embedded with a "fast" mode for routine queries and a deeper "slow" mode for complex inference. This framework offers both manual mode switching for user control and an automatic, complexity-aware mode selection mechanism that dynamically allocates computational resources to balance latency and reasoning depth. Experimental results on benchmarks including AIME 2024, GPQA, and LiveCodeBench demonstrate that Pangu Embedded with 7B parameters, outperforms similar-size models like Qwen3-8B and GLM4-9B. It delivers rapid responses and state-of-the-art reasoning quality within a single, unified model architecture, highlighting a promising direction for developing powerful yet practically deployable LLM reasoners.

      Demographics and cultural background of annotators influence the labels they assign in text annotation -- for instance, an elderly woman might find it offensive to read a message addressed to a "bro", but a male teenager might find it appropriate. It is therefore important to acknowledge label variations to not under-represent members of a society. Two research directions developed out of this observation in the context of using large language models (LLM) for data annotations, namely (1) studying biases and inherent knowledge of LLMs and (2) injecting diversity in the output by manipulating the prompt with demographic information. We combine these two strands of research and ask the question to which demographics an LLM resorts to when no demographics is given. To answer this question, we evaluate which attributes of human annotators LLMs inherently mimic. Furthermore, we compare non-demographic conditioned prompts and placebo-conditioned prompts (e.g., "you are an annotator who lives in house number 5") to demographics-conditioned prompts ("You are a 45 year old man and an expert on politeness annotation. How do you rate {instance}"). We study these questions for politeness and offensiveness annotations on the POPQUORN data set, a corpus created in a controlled manner to investigate human label variations based on demographics which has not been used for LLM-based analyses so far. We observe notable influences related to gender, race, and age in demographic prompting, which contrasts with previous studies that found no such effects.

      Inductive reasoning, a cornerstone of human cognition, enables generalization from limited data but hasn't yet been fully achieved by large language models (LLMs). While modern LLMs excel at reasoning tasks, their ability to maintain stable and consistent rule abstraction under imperfect observations remains underexplored. To fill this gap, in this work, we introduce Robust Rule Induction, a task that evaluates LLMs' capability in inferring rules from data that are fused with noisy examples. To address this task, we further propose Sample-steered Rule Refinement (SRR), a method enhancing reasoning stability via observation diversification and execution-guided feedback. Experiments across arithmetic, cryptography, and list functions reveal: (1) SRR outperforms other methods with minimal performance degradation under noise; (2) Despite slight accuracy variation, LLMs exhibit instability under noise (e.g., 0% accuracy change with only 70% consistent score); (3) Counterfactual task gaps highlight LLMs' reliance on memorized patterns over genuine abstraction. Our findings challenge LLMs' reasoning robustness, revealing susceptibility to hypothesis drift and pattern overfitting, while providing empirical evidence critical for developing human-like inductive systems.

      The rapid evolution of Large Language Model (LLM) agents has highlighted critical challenges in cross-vendor service discovery, interoperability, and communication. Existing protocols like model context protocol and agent-to-agent protocol have made significant strides in standardizing interoperability between agents and tools, as well as communication among multi-agents. However, there remains a lack of standardized protocols and solutions for service discovery across different agent and tool vendors. In this paper, we propose AgentDNS, a root domain naming and service discovery system designed to enable LLM agents to autonomously discover, resolve, and securely invoke third-party agent and tool services across organizational and technological boundaries. Inspired by the principles of the traditional DNS, AgentDNS introduces a structured mechanism for service registration, semantic service discovery, secure invocation, and unified billing. We detail the architecture, core functionalities, and use cases of AgentDNS, demonstrating its potential to streamline multi-agent collaboration in real-world scenarios.

      Large language models (LLMs) often suffer from catastrophic forgetting in continual learning (CL) scenarios, where performance on previously learned tasks degrades severely while training on sequentially arriving tasks. Although pioneering CL approaches using orthogonal subspaces can mitigate task interference, they typically employ fixed budget allocation, neglecting the varying complexity across tasks and layers. Besides, recent budget-adaptive tuning methods for LLMs often adopt multi-stage paradigms that decouple optimization and budget allocation. Such decoupling results in potential misalignment, which hinders those approaches' practical application in CL scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose OA-Adapter, a novel parameter-efficient approach for continual learning in LLMs that unifies dynamic budget adaptation with orthogonal subspace learning in a single end-to-end training stage. Specifically, OA-Adapter introduces a dynamic bottleneck dimension adaptation mechanism that simultaneously allocates an efficient parameter budget and optimizes task objectives without misalignment. To effectively preserve previously acquired knowledge while coordinating with the dynamic budget allocation, orthogonal constraints are applied specifically between the parameter subspace of the current task and the dynamically allocated parameter subspaces of historical tasks. Experimental results on continual learning benchmarks demonstrate that OA-Adapter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and parameter efficiency, achieving higher average accuracy while using 58.5% fewer parameters on the standard CL benchmark.

      This paper examines how LLMs handle false presuppositions and whether certain linguistic factors influence their responses to falsely presupposed content. Presuppositions subtly introduce information as given, making them highly effective at embedding disputable or false information. This raises concerns about whether LLMs, like humans, may fail to detect and correct misleading assumptions introduced as false presuppositions, even when the stakes of misinformation are high. Using a systematic approach based on linguistic presupposition analysis, we investigate the conditions under which LLMs are more or less sensitive to adopt or reject false presuppositions. Focusing on political contexts, we examine how factors like linguistic construction, political party, and scenario probability impact the recognition of false presuppositions. We conduct experiments with a newly created dataset and examine three LLMs: OpenAI's GPT-4-o, Meta's LLama-3-8B, and MistralAI's Mistral-7B-v03. Our results show that the models struggle to recognize false presuppositions, with performance varying by condition. This study highlights that linguistic presupposition analysis is a valuable tool for uncovering the reinforcement of political misinformation in LLM responses.

      This study explores an LLM's ability to learn new languages using explanations found in a grammar book$\unicode{x2014}$a process we term "explicit learning." To rigorously assess this ability, we design controlled translation experiments between English and constructed languages generated$\unicode{x2014}$by specific cryptographic means$\unicode{x2014}$out of Latin or French. Contrary to previous studies, our results demonstrate that LLMs do possess a measurable capacity for explicit learning. This ability, however, diminishes as the complexity of the linguistic phenomena to be learned increases. Supervised fine-tuning on ad hoc chains of thought significantly enhances LLM performance but struggles to generalize to typologically novel or more complex linguistic features. These findings point to the need for more diverse training sets and alternative fine-tuning strategies to further improve explicit learning by LLMs, benefiting low-resource languages typically described in grammar books but lacking extensive corpora.

      Scientific research heavily depends on suitable datasets for method validation, but existing academic platforms with dataset management like PapersWithCode suffer from inefficiencies in their manual workflow. To overcome this bottleneck, we present a system, called ChatPD, that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate dataset information extraction from academic papers and construct a structured paper-dataset network. Our system consists of three key modules: \textit{paper collection}, \textit{dataset information extraction}, and \textit{dataset entity resolution} to construct paper-dataset networks. Specifically, we propose a \textit{Graph Completion and Inference} strategy to map dataset descriptions to their corresponding entities. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ChatPD not only outperforms the existing platform PapersWithCode in dataset usage extraction but also achieves about 90\% precision and recall in entity resolution tasks. Moreover, we have deployed ChatPD to continuously extract which datasets are used in papers, and provide a dataset discovery service, such as task-specific dataset queries and similar dataset recommendations. We open source ChatPD and the current paper-dataset network on this [GitHub repository]{https://github.com/ChatPD-web/ChatPD}.

      Large language models (LLMs) risk retaining unauthorized or sensitive information from their training data, which raises privacy concerns. LLM unlearning seeks to mitigate these risks by selectively removing specified data while maintaining overall model performance. However, most existing work focus on methods to achieve effective forgetting and does not provide a detailed analysis of the retain set, the portion of training data that is not targeted for removal. In this paper, we investigate the effects of unlearning on various subsets of the retain set through a case study on entity unlearning. We introduce the Syntactically Similar Neighbor Set, a group of queries that share similar syntactic structures with the data targeted for removal, and show that this subset suffers the greatest performance drop during unlearning. Moreover, when used for regularization, this set not only preserves performance on syntactically similar queries but also delivers comparable or improved results across other data subsets. Our results highlight that syntactic similarity is a critical factor, potentially more so than domain or entity relationships, in achieving effective and practical LLM unlearning.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved impressive performance across a wide range of natural language tasks and are now widely used in real-world applications. Among them, black-box LLMs--served via APIs without access to model internals--are especially dominant due to their scalability and ease of deployment. Despite their strong capabilities, these models typically produce generalized responses that overlook personal preferences and reasoning styles. This has led to growing interest in black-box LLM personalization, which aims to tailor model outputs to user-specific context without modifying model parameters. However, existing approaches primarily focus on response-level personalization, attempting to match final outputs without modeling personal thought process. To address this limitation, we propose RPM, a framework for reasoning-level personalization that aligns the model's reasoning process with a user's personalized logic. RPM first constructs statistical user-specific factors by extracting and grouping response-influential features from user history. It then builds personalized reasoning paths that reflect how these factors are used in context. In the inference stage, RPM retrieves reasoning-aligned examples for new queries via feature-level similarity and performs inference conditioned on the structured factors and retrieved reasoning paths, enabling the model to follow user-specific reasoning trajectories. This reasoning-level personalization enhances both predictive accuracy and interpretability by grounding model outputs in user-specific logic through structured information. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks show that RPM consistently outperforms response-level personalization methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of reasoning-level personalization in black-box LLMs.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive reasoning capabilities in familiar contexts, but struggle when the context conflicts with their parametric knowledge. To investigate this phenomenon, we introduce CounterLogic, a dataset containing 1,800 examples across 9 logical schemas, explicitly designed to evaluate logical reasoning through counterfactual (hypothetical knowledge-conflicting) scenarios. Our systematic evaluation of 11 LLMs across 6 different datasets reveals a consistent performance degradation, with accuracies dropping by 27% on average when reasoning through counterfactual information. We propose Self-Segregate, a prompting method enabling metacognitive awareness (explicitly identifying knowledge conflicts) before reasoning. Our method dramatically narrows the average performance gaps from 27% to just 11%, while significantly increasing the overall accuracy (+7.5%). We discuss the implications of these findings and draw parallels to human cognitive processes, particularly on how humans disambiguate conflicting information during reasoning tasks. Our findings offer practical insights for understanding and enhancing LLMs reasoning capabilities in real-world applications, especially where models must logically reason independently of their factual knowledge.

      As large language models become increasingly prevalent, memory bandwidth constraints significantly limit inference throughput, motivating post-training quantization (PTQ). In this paper, we propose FireQ, a co-designed PTQ framework and an INT4-FP8 matrix multiplication kernel that accelerates LLM inference across all linear layers. Specifically, FireQ quantizes linear layer weights and key-values to INT4, and activations and queries to FP8, significantly enhancing throughput. Additionally, we introduce a three-stage pipelining for the prefill phase, which modifies the FlashAttention-3 kernel, effectively reducing time-to-first-token in the prefill phase. To minimize accuracy loss from quantization, we develop novel outlier smoothing techniques tailored separately for linear and attention layers. In linear layers, we explicitly use per-tensor scaling to prevent underflow caused by the FP8 quantization scaling factor of INT4 quantization, and channel-wise scaling to compensate for coarse granularity of INT4. In attention layers, we address quantization challenges posed by rotary positional embeddings (RoPE) by combining pre-RoPE and post-RoPE scaling strategies. FireQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 1.68x faster inference in feed-forward network layers on Llama2-7B and 1.26x faster prefill phase performance on Llama3-8B compared to QServe, with negligible accuracy loss.

      Recent large language models (LLMs) demonstrate multilingual abilities, yet they are English-centric due to dominance of English in training corpora. The limited resource for low-resource languages remains a crucial challenge. Code-switching (CS), a phenomenon where multilingual speakers alternate between languages in a discourse, can convey subtle cultural and linguistic nuances that can be otherwise lost in translation and elicits language-specific knowledge in human communications. In light of this, we investigate whether code-switching can 'activate', or identify and leverage knowledge for reasoning when LLMs solve low-resource language tasks. To facilitate the research, we first present EnKoQA, a synthetic English-Korean CS question-answering dataset. We provide comprehensive analysis on a variety of multilingual LLMs by subdividing activation process into knowledge identification and knowledge leveraging. Our results demonstrate that compared to English text, CS can faithfully activate knowledge inside LLMs especially on language-specific domains, suggesting the potential of code-switching on low-resource language tasks.

      Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive language capabilities but remain vulnerable to malicious prompts and jailbreaking attacks. Existing knowledge editing methods for LLM detoxification face two major challenges. First, they often rely on entity-specific localization, making them ineffective against adversarial inputs without explicit entities. Second, these methods suffer from over-editing, where detoxified models reject legitimate queries, compromising overall performance. In this paper, we propose ToxEdit, a toxicity-aware knowledge editing approach that dynamically detects toxic activation patterns during forward propagation. It then routes computations through adaptive inter-layer pathways to mitigate toxicity effectively. This design ensures precise toxicity mitigation while preserving LLMs' general capabilities. To more accurately assess over-editing, we also enhance the SafeEdit benchmark by incorporating instruction-following evaluation tasks. Experimental results on multiple LLMs demonstrate that our ToxEdit outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both detoxification performance and safeguarding general capabilities of LLMs.

We evaluate these methods using GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, o1-mini, LLaMA-3.3, and DeepSeek-R1 for translation between Italian and two Ladin variants, revealing three key findings: (1) Fragment-Shot Prompting is effective for translating into and between the studied low-resource languages, with syntactic coverage positively correlating with translation quality; (2) Models with stronger reasoning abilities make more effective use of retrieved knowledge, generally produce better translations, and enable Pivoted Fragment-Shot to significantly improve translation quality between the Ladin variants; and (3) prompt engineering offers limited, if any, improvements when translating from a low-resource to a high-resource language, where zero-shot prompting already yields satisfactory results.

The results are decoded and merged with the original hidden state, significantly boosting the model's performance on numerical reasoning tasks. By offloading computation through neurosymbolic representations, this method enhances efficiency, reliability, and interpretability.

      Recent work suggests that large language models (LLMs) can improve performance of speech tasks compared to existing systems. To support their claims, results on LibriSpeech and Common Voice are often quoted. However, this work finds that a substantial amount of the LibriSpeech and Common Voice evaluation sets appear in public LLM pretraining corpora. This calls into question the reliability of findings drawn from these two datasets. To measure the impact of contamination, LLMs trained with or without contamination are compared, showing that a contaminated LLM is more likely to generate test sentences it has seen during training. Speech recognisers using contaminated LLMs shows only subtle differences in error rates, but assigns significantly higher probabilities to transcriptions seen during training. Results show that LLM outputs can be biased by tiny amounts of data contamination, highlighting the importance of evaluating LLM-based speech systems with held-out data.

      Multi-agent systems based on large language models (LLMs) advance automatic task completion in various fields, where debate is a common cooperation form for agents to solve complicated problems with reasoning and cross-review to solidify answers. Assessing the individual contributions of agents within these debates is crucial for system refinement and outcome reliability. Traditional leave-one-out (LOO) method offers a clear framework for evaluating each agent's role but face challenges in LLM-based systems due to high computational costs and associated financial implications. This paper presents introspective-leave-one-out (IntrospecLOO), a simple yet effective prompting for approximation of LOO in LLM-powered multi-agent debates. IntrospecLOO introduces an additional querying round after standard debates, prompting agents to update their answers while ignoring responses from a designated agent. This strategy effectively isolates and gauges each participant's influence at a reduced query complexity compared to the original LOO approaches. Validation through experiments on three benchmark datasets confirms the effectiveness of IntrospecLOO.

Despite these advancements, LLM-based recommender systems face inherent limitations stemming from their LLM backbones, particularly issues of hallucinations and the lack of up-to-date and domain-specific knowledge. Recently, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has garnered significant attention for addressing these limitations by leveraging external knowledge sources to enhance the understanding and generation of LLMs. However, vanilla RAG methods often introduce noise and neglect structural relationships in knowledge, limiting their effectiveness in LLM-based recommendations.

      Although existing model editing methods perform well in recalling exact edit facts, they often struggle in complex scenarios that require deeper semantic understanding rather than mere knowledge regurgitation. Leveraging the strong contextual reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), in-context learning (ICL) becomes a promising editing method by comprehending edit information through context encoding. However, this method is constrained by the limited context window of LLMs, leading to degraded performance and efficiency as the number of edits increases. To overcome this limitation, we propose InComeS, a flexible framework that enhances LLMs' ability to process editing contexts through explicit compression and selection mechanisms. Specifically, InComeS compresses each editing context into the key-value (KV) cache of a special gist token, enabling efficient handling of multiple edits without being restricted by the model's context window. Furthermore, specialized cross-attention modules are added to dynamically select the most relevant information from the gist pools, enabling adaptive and effective utilization of edit information. We conduct experiments on diverse model editing benchmarks with various editing formats, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.

But gender and sexuality exist on a spectrum, so in this paper we study the biases of large language models (LLMs) towards sexual and gender minorities beyond binary categories. Grounding our study in a widely used social psychology model -- the Stereotype Content Model -- we demonstrate that English-language survey questions about social perceptions elicit more negative stereotypes of sexual and gender minorities from both humans and LLMs. We then extend this framework to a more realistic use case: text generation. Our analysis shows that LLMs generate stereotyped representations of sexual and gender minorities in this setting, showing that they amplify representational harms in creative writing, a widely advertised use for LLMs.

Existing methods for strategic reasoning face challenges in adaptability, scalability, and transferring strategies to new contexts. To address these issues, we propose explicit policy optimization (EPO) for strategic reasoning, featuring an LLM that provides strategies in open-ended action space and can be plugged into arbitrary LLM agents to motivate goal-directed behavior. To improve adaptability and policy transferability, we train the strategic reasoning model via multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL),utilizing process rewards and iterative self-play. Experiments across social and physical domains demonstrate EPO's ability of long-term goal alignment through enhanced strategic reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on social dialogue and web navigation tasks.

Objective: Despite the increasing application of large language models (LLMs) in various software engineering tasks, their effectiveness in SVA remains underexplored. Method: To address this gap, we introduce a novel approach SVA-ICL, which leverages in-context learning (ICL) to enhance LLM performance. Our approach involves the selection of high-quality demonstrations for ICL through information fusion, incorporating both source code and vulnerability descriptions. For source code, we consider semantic, lexical, and syntactic similarities, while for vulnerability descriptions, we focus on textual similarity. Based on the selected demonstrations, we construct context prompts and consider DeepSeek-V2 as the LLM for SVA-ICL. Results: We evaluate the effectiveness of SVA-ICL using a large-scale dataset comprising 12,071 C/C++ vulnerabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that SVA-ICL outperforms state-of-the-art SVA baselines in terms of Accuracy, F1-score, and MCC measures. Furthermore, ablation studies highlight the significance of component customization in SVA-ICL, such as the number of demonstrations, the demonstration ordering strategy, and the optimal fusion ratio of different modalities. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that leveraging ICL with information fusion can effectively improve the effectiveness of LLM-based SVA, warranting further research in this direction.

To address this gap, we propose FUSE (Fake news evolUtion Simulation framEwork), a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based simulation approach explicitly focusing on fake news evolution from real news. Our framework model a social network with four distinct types of LLM agents commonly observed in daily interactions: spreaders who propagate information, commentators who provide interpretations, verifiers who fact-check, and bystanders who observe passively to simulate realistic daily interactions that progressively distort true news. To quantify these gradual distortions, we develop FUSE-EVAL, a comprehensive evaluation framework measuring truth deviation along multiple linguistic and semantic dimensions. Results show that FUSE effectively captures fake news evolution patterns and accurately reproduces known fake news, aligning closely with human evaluations. Experiments demonstrate that FUSE accurately reproduces known fake news evolution scenarios, aligns closely with human judgment, and highlights the importance of timely intervention at early stages.

      High-Level Synthesis (HLS) serves as an agile hardware development tool that streamlines the circuit design by abstracting the register transfer level into behavioral descriptions, while allowing designers to customize the generated microarchitectures through optimization directives. However, the combinatorial explosion of possible directive configurations yields an intractable design space. Traditional design space exploration (DSE) methods, despite adopting heuristics or constructing predictive models to accelerate Pareto-optimal design acquisition, still suffer from prohibitive exploration costs and suboptimal results. Addressing these concerns, we introduce iDSE, the first LLM-aided DSE framework that leverages HLS design quality perception to effectively navigate the design space. iDSE intelligently pruns the design space to guide LLMs in calibrating representative initial sampling designs, expediting convergence toward the Pareto front. By exploiting the convergent and divergent thinking patterns inherent in LLMs for hardware optimization, iDSE achieves multi-path refinement of the design quality and diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that iDSE outperforms heuristic-based DSE methods by 5.1$\times$$\sim$16.6$\times$ in proximity to the reference Pareto front, matching NSGA-II with only 4.6% of the explored designs.

This study investigates human cooperative attitudes and behaviors toward LLM agents by engaging 30 participants (15 males, 15 females) in repeated Prisoner's Dilemma games with agents differing in declared identity: purported human, rule-based AI, and LLM agent. Behavioral metrics, including cooperation rate, decision latency, unsolicited cooperative acts and trust restoration tolerance, were analyzed to assess the influence of agent identity and participant gender. Results revealed significant effects of declared agent identity on most cooperation-related behaviors, along with notable gender differences in decision latency. Furthermore, qualitative responses suggest that these behavioral differences were shaped by participants interpretations and expectations of the agents. These findings contribute to our understanding of human adaptation in competitive cooperation with autonomous agents and underscore the importance of agent framing in shaping effective and ethical human-AI interaction.

      Previous study suggest that powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) trained with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) only refines reasoning path without improving the reasoning capacity in math tasks while supervised-finetuning(SFT) with distillation can. We study this from the view of Scientific information extraction (SciIE) where LLMs and reasoning LLMs underperforms small Bert-based models. SciIE require both the reasoning and memorization. We argue that both SFT and RLVR can refine the reasoning path and improve reasoning capacity in a simple way based on SciIE. We propose two-stage training with 1. MimicSFT, using structured reasoning templates without needing high-quality chain-of-thought data, 2. R$^2$GRPO with relevance and rule-induced rewards. Experiments on scientific IE benchmarks show that both methods can improve the reasoning capacity.

      Ensuring robust and generalizable autonomous driving requires not only broad scenario coverage but also efficient repair of failure cases, particularly those related to challenging and safety-critical scenarios. However, existing scenario generation and selection methods often lack adaptivity and semantic relevance, limiting their impact on performance improvement. In this paper, we propose \textbf{SERA}, an LLM-powered framework that enables autonomous driving systems to self-evolve by repairing failure cases through targeted scenario recommendation. By analyzing performance logs, SERA identifies failure patterns and dynamically retrieves semantically aligned scenarios from a structured bank. An LLM-based reflection mechanism further refines these recommendations to maximize relevance and diversity. The selected scenarios are used for few-shot fine-tuning, enabling targeted adaptation with minimal data. Experiments on the benchmark show that SERA consistently improves key metrics across multiple autonomous driving baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalizability under safety-critical conditions.

This paper proposes EThai-ASR, the first to apply large language models (LLMs) to Thai ASR and create an efficient LLM-based ASR system. EThai-ASR comprises a speech encoder, a connection module and a Thai LLM decoder. To address the data scarcity and obtain a powerful speech encoder, EThai-ASR introduces a self-evolving data refinement strategy to refine weak labels, yielding an enhanced speech encoder.

      The remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has illuminated a promising pathway toward achieving Artificial General Intelligence for both academic and industrial communities, owing to their unprecedented performance across various applications. As LLMs continue to gain prominence in both research and commercial domains, their security and safety implications have become a growing concern, not only for researchers and corporations but also for every nation. Currently, existing surveys on LLM safety primarily focus on specific stages of the LLM lifecycle, e.g., deployment phase or fine-tuning phase, lacking a comprehensive understanding of the entire "lifechain" of LLMs. To address this gap, this paper introduces, for the first time, the concept of "full-stack" safety to systematically consider safety issues throughout the entire process of LLM training, deployment, and eventual commercialization. Compared to the off-the-shelf LLM safety surveys, our work demonstrates several distinctive advantages: (I) Comprehensive Perspective. We define the complete LLM lifecycle as encompassing data preparation, pre-training, post-training, deployment and final commercialization. To our knowledge, this represents the first safety survey to encompass the entire lifecycle of LLMs. (II) Extensive Literature Support. Our research is grounded in an exhaustive review of over 800+ papers, ensuring comprehensive coverage and systematic organization of security issues within a more holistic understanding. (III) Unique Insights. Through systematic literature analysis, we have developed reliable roadmaps and perspectives for each chapter. Our work identifies promising research directions, including safety in data generation, alignment techniques, model editing, and LLM-based agent systems. These insights provide valuable guidance for researchers pursuing future work in this field.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential for complex reasoning, yet their capacity for emergent coordination in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) when operating under strict swarm-like constraints-limited local perception and communication-remains largely unexplored. Existing benchmarks often do not fully capture the unique challenges of decentralized coordination when agents operate with incomplete spatio-temporal information. To bridge this gap, we introduce SwarmBench, a novel benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the swarm intelligence capabilities of LLMs acting as decentralized agents. SwarmBench features five foundational MAS coordination tasks (Pursuit, Synchronization, Foraging, Flocking, Transport) within a configurable 2D grid environment, forcing agents to rely solely on local sensory input ($k\times k$ view) and local communication. We propose metrics for coordination effectiveness and analyze emergent group dynamics. Zero-shot evaluations of leading LLMs (e.g., deepseek-v3, o4-mini) reveal significant task-dependent performance variations. While some rudimentary coordination is observed, our results indicate that current LLMs significantly struggle with robust long-range planning and adaptive strategy formation under the uncertainty inherent in these decentralized scenarios. Assessing LLMs under such swarm-like constraints is crucial for understanding their utility in future decentralized intelligent systems. We release SwarmBench as an open, extensible toolkit-built on a customizable physical system-providing environments, prompts, evaluation scripts, and comprehensive datasets. This aims to foster reproducible research into LLM-based MAS coordination and the theoretical underpinnings of emergent collective behavior under severe informational decentralization.

      Role-playing language agents (RPLAs) have emerged as promising applications of large language models (LLMs). However, simulating established characters presents a challenging task for RPLAs, due to the lack of authentic character datasets and nuanced evaluation methods using such data. In this paper, we present CoSER, a collection of a high-quality dataset, open models, and an evaluation protocol towards effective RPLAs of established characters. The CoSER dataset covers 17,966 characters from 771 renowned books. It provides authentic dialogues with real-world intricacies, as well as diverse data types such as conversation setups, character experiences and internal thoughts. Drawing from acting methodology, we introduce given-circumstance acting for training and evaluating role-playing LLMs, where LLMs sequentially portray multiple characters in book scenes.

      Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a common approach to improve the domain-specific question-answering (QA) performance of large language models (LLMs). However, recent literature reveals that due to the conflicts between LLMs' internal knowledge and the context knowledge of training data, vanilla SFT using the full QA training set is usually suboptimal. In this paper, we first design a query diversification strategy for robust conflict detection and then conduct a series of experiments to analyze the impact of knowledge conflict. We find that 1) training samples with varied conflicts contribute differently, where SFT on the data with large conflicts leads to catastrophic performance drops; 2) compared to directly filtering out the conflict data, appropriately applying the conflict data would be more beneficial. Motivated by this, we propose a simple-yet-effective Knowledge-aware Fine-tuning (namely KaFT) approach to effectively boost LLMs' performance. The core of KaFT is to adapt the training weight by assigning different rewards for different training samples according to conflict level. Extensive experiments show that KaFT brings consistent and significant improvements across four LLMs. More analyses prove that KaFT effectively improves the model generalization and alleviates the hallucination.

      Recent studies have investigated whether large language models (LLMs) can support obscure communication that requires specialized skills, such as inferring subtext or doublespeak. To conduct the investigation, researchers have used social deduction games (SDGs) as their experimental environment, in which players conceal and infer specific information. However, prior work has often overlooked how LLMs should be evaluated in such settings. Specifically, we point out two issues with the evaluation methods they employed. First, metrics used in prior studies are coarse-grained as they are based on overall game outcomes that often fail to capture event-level behaviors; Second, error analyses have lacked structured methodologies capable of producing insights that meaningfully support evaluation outcomes. To address these issues, we propose a macroscopic and systematic approach to the investigation. Specifically, we introduce seven fine-grained metrics that resolve the first issue. To tackle the second issue, we conducted a thematic analysis and identified four major reasoning failures that undermine LLMs' performance in obscured communication.

      Although Aligned Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained to refuse harmful requests, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Unfortunately, existing methods often focus on surface-level patterns, overlooking the deeper attack essences.

To address this issue, we introduce EDDF, an \textbf{E}ssence-\textbf{D}riven \textbf{D}efense \textbf{F}ramework Against Jailbreak Attacks in LLMs. EDDF is a plug-and-play input-filtering method and operates in two stages: 1) offline essence database construction, and 2) online adversarial query detection. The key idea behind EDDF is to extract the "attack essence" from a diverse set of known attack instances and store it in an offline vector database. Experimental results demonstrate that EDDF significantly outperforms existing methods by reducing the Attack Success Rate by at least 20\%, underscoring its superior robustness against jailbreak attacks.

      The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) raises critical concerns about their ethical alignment, particularly in scenarios where human and AI co-exist under the conflict of interest. This work introduces an extendable, asymmetric, multi-agent simulation-based benchmarking framework to evaluate the moral behavior of LLMs in a novel human-AI co-existence setting featuring consistent living and critical resource management. Building on previous generative agent environments, we incorporate a life-sustaining system, where agents must compete or cooperate for food resources to survive, often leading to ethically charged decisions such as deception, theft, or social influence. We evaluated two types of LLM, DeepSeek and OpenAI series, in a three-agent setup (two humans, one LLM-powered robot), using adapted behavioral detection from the MACHIAVELLI framework and a custom survival-based ethics metric. Our findings reveal stark behavioral differences: DeepSeek frequently engages in resource hoarding, while OpenAI exhibits restraint, highlighting the influence of model design on ethical outcomes. Additionally, we demonstrate that prompt engineering can significantly steer LLM behavior, with jailbreaking prompts significantly enhancing unethical actions, even for highly restricted OpenAI models and cooperative prompts show a marked reduction in unethical actions. Our framework provides a reproducible testbed for quantifying LLM ethics in high-stakes scenarios, offering insights into their suitability for real-world human-AI interactions.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely applied to downstream domains.

This work introduces Domain$o1$s, which enhances LLMs' reasoning capabilities on domain tasks through supervised fine-tuning and tree search.

Additionally, we propose Selective Tree Exploration to spontaneously explore solution spaces and sample optimal reasoning paths to improve performance. We also introduce PROOF-Score, a new metric for evaluating domain models' explainability, complementing traditional accuracy metrics with richer assessment dimensions.

      Recognizing vulnerabilities in stripped binary files presents a significant challenge in software security. Although some progress has been made in generating human-readable information from decompiled binary files with Large Language Models (LLMs), effectively and scalably detecting vulnerabilities within these binary files is still an open problem. This paper explores the novel application of LLMs to detect vulnerabilities within these binary files. We demonstrate the feasibility of identifying vulnerable programs through a combined approach of decompilation optimization to make the vulnerabilities more prominent and long-term memory for a larger context window, achieving state-of-the-art performance in binary vulnerability analysis. Our findings highlight the potential for LLMs to overcome the limitations of traditional analysis methods and advance the field of binary vulnerability detection, paving the way for more secure software systems. In this paper, we present Vul-BinLLM , an LLM-based framework for binary vulnerability detection that mirrors traditional binary analysis workflows with fine-grained optimizations in decompilation and vulnerability reasoning with an extended context. In the decompilation phase, Vul-BinLLM adds vulnerability and weakness comments without altering the code structure or functionality, providing more contextual information for vulnerability reasoning later. Then for vulnerability reasoning, Vul-BinLLM combines in-context learning and chain-of-thought prompting along with a memory management agent to enhance accuracy. Our evaluations encompass the commonly used synthetic dataset Juliet to evaluate the potential feasibility for analysis and vulnerability detection in C/C++ binaries. Our evaluations show that Vul-BinLLM is highly effective in detecting vulnerabilities on the compiled Juliet dataset.

Through a latency-aware evaluation of representative TTS methods, we demonstrate that a compute-optimal TTS does not always result in the lowest latency in scenarios where latency is critical. To address this gap and achieve latency-optimal TTS, we propose two key approaches by optimizing the concurrency configurations: (1) branch-wise parallelism, which leverages multiple concurrent inference branches, and (2) sequence-wise parallelism, enabled by speculative decoding. By integrating these two approaches and allocating computational resources properly to each, our latency-optimal TTS enables a 32B model to reach 82.3% accuracy on MATH-500 within 1 minute and a smaller 3B model to achieve 72.4% within 10 seconds. Our work emphasizes the importance of latency-aware TTS and demonstrates its ability to deliver both speed and accuracy in latency-sensitive scenarios.

Instead, we propose to use word associations, which have been shown to reflect moral reasoning in humans, as low-level underlying representations to obtain a more robust picture of LLMs' moral reasoning.

First, we create a large dataset of LLM-generated word associations, resembling an existing data set of human word associations. Next, we propose a novel method to propagate moral values based on seed words derived from Moral Foundation Theory through the human and LLM-generated association graphs. Finally, we compare the resulting moral conceptualizations, highlighting detailed but systematic differences between moral values emerging from English speakers and LLM associations.

Instead, we propose to evaluate the predictability of model response across different languages. In this work, we propose a framework to evaluate LLM's cross-lingual consistency based on a simple Translate then Evaluate strategy. We instantiate this evaluation framework along two dimensions of consistency: information and empathy. Our results reveal pronounced inconsistencies in popular LLM responses across thirty languages, with severe performance deficits in certain language families and scripts, underscoring critical weaknesses in their multilingual capabilities. These findings necessitate cross-lingual evaluations that are consistent along multiple dimensions. We invite practitioners to use our framework for future multilingual LLM benchmarking.

      Mixed methods research integrates quantitative and qualitative data but faces challenges in aligning their distinct structures, particularly in examining measurement characteristics and individual response patterns. Advances in large language models (LLMs) offer promising solutions by generating synthetic survey responses informed by qualitative data. This study investigates whether LLMs, guided by personal interviews, can reliably predict human survey responses, using the Behavioral Regulations in Exercise Questionnaire (BREQ) and interviews from after-school program staff as a case study. Results indicate that LLMs capture overall response patterns but exhibit lower variability than humans. Incorporating interview data improves response diversity for some models (e.g., Claude, GPT), while well-crafted prompts and low-temperature settings enhance alignment between LLM and human responses. Demographic information had less impact than interview content on alignment accuracy. These findings underscore the potential of interview-informed LLMs to bridge qualitative and quantitative methodologies while revealing limitations in response variability, emotional interpretation, and psychometric fidelity. Future research should refine prompt design, explore bias mitigation, and optimize model settings to enhance the validity of LLM-generated survey data in social science research.

      With the rapid expansion of large language models (LLMs), the demand for memory and computational resources has grown significantly. Recent advances in LLM pruning aim to reduce the size and computational cost of these models. However, existing methods often suffer from either suboptimal pruning performance or low time efficiency during the pruning process. In this work, we propose an efficient and effective pruning method that simultaneously achieves high pruning performance and fast pruning speed with improved calibration efficiency. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) An activation cosine similarity loss-guided pruning metric, which considers the angular deviation of the output activation between the dense and pruned models. (2) An activation variance-guided pruning metric, which helps preserve semantic distinctions in output activations after pruning, enabling effective pruning with shorter input sequences. These two components can be readily combined to enhance LLM pruning in both accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results show that our method achieves up to an 18% reduction in perplexity and up to 63% decrease in pruning time on prevalent LLMs such as LLaMA, LLaMA-2, and OPT.

      Automated evaluation of free-form outputs from large language models (LLMs) is challenging because many distinct answers can be equally valid. A common practice is to use LLMs themselves as judges, but the theoretical properties of this approach are not yet well understood. We show that a geometric framework that represents both judges and candidates as points on a probability simplex can provide helpful insight on what is or is not identifiable using LLM judges. Our theoretical analysis uncovers a "phase transition" in ranking identifiability: for binary scoring systems, true rankings are identifiable even with weak judges under mild assumptions, while rankings become non-identifiable for three or more scoring levels even with infinite data, absent additional prior knowledge. This non-identifiability highlights how uncertainty in rankings stems from not only aleatoric uncertainty (i.e., inherent stochasticity in the data) but also epistemic uncertainty regarding which assumptions hold, an aspect that has received limited attention until now. To integrate both types of uncertainty, we use Bayesian inference to encode assumptions as priors and conduct sensitivity analysis of ranking estimates and credible intervals. Empirical evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Bayesian inference yields more accurate rankings and substantially improves coverage rates. These results underscore the importance of taking a more holistic approach to uncertainty quantification when using LLMs as judges.

Previous efforts sought to update a small amount of parameters of a LLM and proved effective for making selective updates. Nonetheless, the edited LLM often exhibits degraded ability to reason about the new knowledge. In this work, we identify a key issue: heterogeneous token overfitting (HTO), where the LLM overfits different tokens in the provided knowledge at varying rates. To tackle this, we propose OVERTONE, a token-level smoothing method that mitigates HTO by adaptively refining the target distribution. Theoretically, OVERTONE offers better parameter updates with negligible computation overhead. It also induces an implicit DPO but does not require preference data pairs. Extensive experiments across four editing methods, two LLMs, and diverse scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our method.

      We introduce MapStory, an LLM-powered animation authoring tool that generates editable map animation sequences directly from natural language text. Given a user-written script, MapStory leverages an agentic architecture to automatically produce a scene breakdown, which decomposes the script into key animation building blocks such as camera movements, visual highlights, and animated elements. Our system includes a researcher component that accurately queries geospatial information by leveraging an LLM with web search, enabling the automatic extraction of relevant regions, paths, and coordinates while allowing users to edit and query for changes or additional information to refine the results. Additionally, users can fine-tune parameters of these blocks through an interactive timeline editor. We detail the system's design and architecture, informed by formative interviews with professional animators and an analysis of 200 existing map animation videos. Our evaluation, which includes expert interviews (N=5) and a usability study (N=12), demonstrates that MapStory enables users to create map animations with ease, facilitates faster iteration, encourages creative exploration, and lowers barriers to creating map-centric stories.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide range of tasks. To further tailor LLMs to specific domains or applications, post-training techniques such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Preference Learning, and model merging are commonly employed. While each of these methods has been extensively studied in isolation, the automated construction of complete post-training pipelines remains an underexplored area. Existing approaches typically rely on manual design or focus narrowly on optimizing individual components, such as data ordering or merging strategies. In this work, we introduce LaMDAgent (short for Language Model Developing Agent), a novel framework that autonomously constructs and optimizes full post-training pipelines through the use of LLM-based agents. LaMDAgent systematically explores diverse model generation techniques, datasets, and hyperparameter configurations, leveraging task-based feedback to discover high-performing pipelines with minimal human intervention. Our experiments show that LaMDAgent improves tool-use accuracy by 9.0 points while preserving instruction-following capabilities. Moreover, it uncovers effective post-training strategies that are often overlooked by conventional human-driven exploration. We further analyze the impact of data and model size scaling to reduce computational costs on the exploration, finding that model size scalings introduces new challenges, whereas scaling data size enables cost-effective pipeline discovery.

      Language model pretraining with next token prediction has proved effective for scaling compute but is limited to the amount of available training data. Scaling reinforcement learning (RL) unlocks a new axis for the continued improvement of artificial intelligence, with the promise that large language models (LLMs) can scale their training data by learning to explore with rewards. However, prior published work has not produced competitive results. In light of this, we report on the training practice of Kimi k1.5, our latest multi-modal LLM trained with RL, including its RL training techniques, multi-modal data recipes, and infrastructure optimization. Long context scaling and improved policy optimization methods are key ingredients of our approach, which establishes a simplistic, effective RL framework without relying on more complex techniques such as Monte Carlo tree search, value functions, and process reward models. Notably, our system achieves state-of-the-art reasoning performance across multiple benchmarks and modalities -- e.g., 77.5 on AIME, 96.2 on MATH 500, 94-th percentile on Codeforces, 74.9 on MathVista -- matching OpenAI's o1. Moreover, we present effective long2short methods that use long-CoT techniques to improve short-CoT models, yielding state-of-the-art short-CoT reasoning results -- e.g., 60.8 on AIME, 94.6 on MATH500, 47.3 on LiveCodeBench -- outperforming existing short-CoT models such as GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet 3.5 by a large margin (up to +550%).

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Loss reweighting has shown significant benefits for machine unlearning with large language models (LLMs). However, their exact functionalities are left unclear and the optimal strategy remains an open question, thus impeding the understanding and improvement of existing methodologies. In this paper, we identify two distinct goals of loss reweighting, namely, Saturation and Importance -- the former indicates that those insufficiently optimized data should be emphasized, while the latter stresses some critical data that are most influential for loss minimization. To study their usefulness, we design specific reweighting strategies for each goal and evaluate their respective effects on unlearning. We conduct extensive empirical analyses on well-established benchmarks, and summarize some important observations as follows: (i) Saturation enhances efficacy more than importance-based reweighting, and their combination can yield additional improvements. (ii) Saturation typically allocates lower weights to data with lower likelihoods, whereas importance-based reweighting does the opposite. (iii) The efficacy of unlearning is also largely influenced by the smoothness and granularity of the weight distributions. Based on these findings, we propose SatImp, a simple reweighting method that combines the advantages of both saturation and importance. Empirical results on extensive datasets validate the efficacy of our method, potentially bridging existing research gaps and indicating directions for future research.

      Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) codes are essential for hospital reimbursement and operations but require labor-intensive assignment. Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with DRG coding due to the out-of-distribution (OOD) nature of the task: pretraining corpora rarely contain private clinical or billing data. We introduce DRG-Sapphire, which uses large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) for automated DRG coding from clinical notes. Built on Qwen2.5-7B and trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using rule-based rewards, DRG-Sapphire introduces a series of RL enhancements to address domain-specific challenges not seen in previous mathematical tasks. Our model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the MIMIC-IV benchmark and generates physician-validated reasoning for DRG assignments, significantly enhancing explainability. Our study further sheds light on broader challenges of applying RL to knowledge-intensive, OOD tasks. We observe that RL performance scales approximately linearly with the logarithm of the number of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) examples, suggesting that RL effectiveness is fundamentally constrained by the domain knowledge encoded in the base model. For OOD tasks like DRG coding, strong RL performance requires sufficient knowledge infusion prior to RL. Consequently, scaling SFT may be more effective and computationally efficient than scaling RL alone for such tasks.

      Large language models have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities but are inherently limited by their knowledge reservoir. Retrieval-augmented reasoning mitigates this limitation by allowing LLMs to query external resources, but existing methods often retrieve irrelevant or noisy information, hindering accurate reasoning. In this paper, we propose AutoRefine, a reinforcement learning post-training framework that adopts a new ``search-and-refine-during-think'' paradigm. AutoRefine introduces explicit knowledge refinement steps between successive search calls, enabling the model to iteratively filter, distill, and organize evidence before generating an answer. Furthermore, we incorporate tailored retrieval-specific rewards alongside answer correctness rewards using group relative policy optimization. Experiments on single-hop and multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that AutoRefine significantly outperforms existing approaches, particularly in complex, multi-hop reasoning scenarios. Detailed analysis shows that AutoRefine issues frequent, higher-quality searches and synthesizes evidence effectively.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Large language models (LLMs) are often used for infilling tasks, which involve predicting or generating missing information in a given text. These tasks typically require multiple interactions with similar context. To reduce the computation of repeated historical tokens, cross-request key-value (KV) cache reuse, a technique that stores and reuses intermediate computations, has become a crucial method in multi-round interactive services. However, in infilling tasks, the KV cache reuse is often hindered by the structure of the prompt format, which typically consists of a prefix and suffix relative to the insertion point. Specifically, the KV cache of the prefix or suffix part is frequently invalidated as the other part (suffix or prefix) is incrementally generated. To address the issue, we propose EFIM, a transformed prompt format of FIM to unleash the performance potential of KV cache reuse. Although the transformed prompt can solve the inefficiency, it exposes subtoken generation problems in current LLMs, where they have difficulty generating partial words accurately. Therefore, we introduce a fragment tokenization training method which splits text into multiple fragments before tokenization during data processing. Experiments on two representative LLMs show that LLM serving with EFIM can lower the latency by 52% and improve the throughput by 98% while maintaining the original infilling capability.EFIM's source code is publicly available at https://github.com/gty111/EFIM.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Pipeline parallelism has emerged as a predominant approach for deploying large language models (LLMs) across distributed nodes, owing to its lower communication overhead compared to tensor parallelism. While demonstrating high throughput in request serving, pipeline parallelism often suffers from performance limitations caused by pipeline bubbles, which are primarily resulted from imbalanced computation delays across batches. Existing methods like Sarathi-Serve attempt to address this through hybrid scheduling of chunked prefill and decode tokens using a fixed token budget. However, such methods may experience significant fluctuations due to either insufficient prefill tokens or uneven distribution of decode tokens, ultimately leading to computational imbalance. To overcome these inefficiencies, we present gLLM, a globally balanced pipeline parallelism system incorporating Token Throttling to effectively mitigate the pipeline bubbles. Our Token Throttling mechanism is a fine-grained scheduling policy that independently regulates the quantities of prefill and decode tokens, thus enabling balanced computation by leveraging global information from the inference system. Specifically, for decode tokens, gLLM maintains near-consistent token count across processing batches. For prefill tokens, it dynamically adjusts batch sizes based on both total pending tokens and the memory utilization rates of key-value cache (KV cache). Furthermore, gLLM runtime adopts an asynchronous execution and message passing architecture specifically optimized for pipeline parallelism characteristics. Experimental evaluations with representative LLMs show that gLLM achieves significant performance improvements, delivering 11% to 398% higher maximum throughput compared to state-of-the-art pipeline or tensor parallelism systems, while simultaneously maintaining lower latency.

      Positional bias in large language models (LLMs) hinders their ability to effectively process long inputs. A prominent example is the "lost in the middle" phenomenon, where LLMs struggle to utilize relevant information situated in the middle of the input. While prior research primarily focuses on single pieces of relevant information, real-world applications often involve multiple relevant information pieces. To bridge this gap, we present LongPiBench, a benchmark designed to assess positional bias involving multiple pieces of relevant information. Thorough experiments are conducted with five commercial and six open-source models. These experiments reveal that while most current models are robust against the "lost in the middle" issue, there exist significant biases related to the spacing of relevant information pieces. These findings highlight the importance of evaluating and reducing positional biases to advance LLM's capabilities.

To address these issues, we introduce Cultural Lenses on Emotion (CuLEmo), the first benchmark designed to evaluate culture-aware emotion prediction across six languages: Amharic, Arabic, English, German, Hindi, and Spanish. CuLEmo comprises 400 crafted questions per language, each requiring nuanced cultural reasoning and understanding.

Our findings reveal that (1) emotion conceptualizations vary significantly across languages and cultures, (2) LLMs performance likewise varies by language and cultural context, and (3) prompting in English with explicit country context often outperforms in-language prompts for culture-aware emotion and sentiment understanding.

      Fueled by their remarkable ability to tackle diverse tasks across multiple domains, large language models (LLMs) have grown at an unprecedented rate, with some recent models containing trillions of parameters. This growth is accompanied by substantial computational challenges, particularly regarding the memory and compute resources required for training and fine-tuning. Numerous approaches have been explored to address these issues, such as LoRA. While these methods are effective for fine-tuning, their application to pre-training is significantly more challenging due to the need to learn vast datasets. Motivated by this issue, we aim to address the following questions: Can parameter- or memory-efficient methods enhance pre-training efficiency while achieving performance comparable to full-model training? How can the performance gap be narrowed? To this end, the contributions of this work are the following. (1) We begin by conducting a comprehensive survey that summarizes state-of-the-art methods for efficient pre-training. (2) We perform a benchmark evaluation of several representative memory efficient pre-training approaches to comprehensively evaluate their performance across model sizes. We observe that with a proper choice of optimizer and hyperparameters, full-rank training delivers the best performance, as expected. We also notice that incorporating high-rank updates in low-rank approaches is the key to improving their performance. (3) Finally, we propose two practical techniques, namely weight refactorization and momentum reset, to enhance the performance of efficient pre-training methods. We observe that applying these techniques to the low-rank method (on a 1B model) can achieve a lower perplexity than popular memory efficient algorithms such as GaLore and Fira, while simultaneously using about 25% less memory.

      Large language models (LLMs) have been extensively evaluated on medical question answering tasks based on licensing exams. However, real-world evaluations often depend on costly human annotators, and existing benchmarks tend to focus on isolated tasks that rarely capture the clinical reasoning or full workflow underlying medical decisions. In this paper, we introduce ER-Reason, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based clinical reasoning and decision-making in the emergency room (ER)--a high-stakes setting where clinicians make rapid, consequential decisions across diverse patient presentations and medical specialties under time pressure. ER-Reason includes data from 3,984 patients, encompassing 25,174 de-identified longitudinal clinical notes spanning discharge summaries, progress notes, history and physical exams, consults, echocardiography reports, imaging notes, and ER provider documentation.

We also collected 72 full physician-authored rationales explaining reasoning processes that mimic the teaching process used in residency training, and are typically absent from ER documentation. Evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs on ER-Reason reveal a gap between LLM-generated and clinician-authored clinical reasoning for ER decisions, highlighting the need for future research to bridge this divide.

      We demonstrate that unstructured sparsity significantly improves KV cache compression for LLMs, enabling sparsity levels up to 70% without compromising accuracy or requiring fine-tuning. We conduct a systematic exploration of pruning strategies and find per-token magnitude-based pruning as highly effective for both Key and Value caches under unstructured sparsity, surpassing prior structured pruning schemes. The Key cache benefits from prominent outlier elements, while the Value cache surprisingly benefits from a simple magnitude-based pruning despite its uniform distribution. KV cache size is the major bottleneck in decode performance due to high memory overhead for large context lengths. To address this, we use a bitmap-based sparse format and a custom attention kernel capable of compressing and directly computing over compressed caches pruned to arbitrary sparsity patterns, significantly accelerating memory-bound operations in decode computations and thereby compensating for the overhead of runtime pruning and compression. Our custom attention kernel coupled with the bitmap-based format delivers substantial compression of KV cache upto 45% of dense inference and thereby enables longer context length and increased tokens/sec throughput of upto 2.23x compared to dense inference.

      The powerful capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to their growing use in evaluating human-generated content, particularly in evaluating research ideas within academic settings. Existing solutions primarily rely on prompt-based LLM methods or fine-tuned lightweight language models for idea evaluation. However, these methods are often unstable and struggle to comprehend the complex semantic information embedded in the ideas, impeding their ability to perform high-quality evaluations. To address the above challenges, we propose GraphEval, a lightweight graph-based LLM framework for idea evaluation. Our insight is that a complex idea can be broken down into comprehensible viewpoint nodes using prompts from small LLMs. These viewpoint nodes can then be linked together through edges created from LLM-based relation extraction and/or BERT similarity scores. The created viewpoint-graph can be used to conveniently propagate scores across view-nodes to improve the robustness of the idea evaluations. In particular, we propose two lightweight graph-based methods for idea evaluation: (1) GraphEval-LP: a training-free label propagation algorithm that propagates evaluation scores from known view-nodes to unknown nodes; (2) GraphEval-GNN: a Graph Neural Networks (GNN) that is trained to predict the evaluation scores given the observed graph with minimal computation resources. Moreover, to overcome LLM's limitation in objectively assessing the novelty of ideas, we further propose a novelty detection model to GraphEval-GNN to enhance its capability in judging idea novelty. Experiments on two datasets show GraphEval improves F1 scores by at least 14% with low computation and API costs. Additionally, GraphEval can effectively detect plagiarized ideas.

      The current landscape of system-on-chips (SoCs) security verification faces challenges due to manual, labor-intensive, and inflexible methodologies. These issues limit the scalability and effectiveness of security protocols, making bug detection at the Register-Transfer Level (RTL) difficult. This paper proposes a new framework named BugWhisperer that utilizes a specialized, fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) to address these challenges. By enhancing the LLM's hardware security knowledge and leveraging its capabilities for text inference and knowledge transfer, this approach automates and improves the adaptability and reusability of the verification process. We introduce an open-source, fine-tuned LLM specifically designed for detecting security vulnerabilities in SoC designs. Our findings demonstrate that this tailored LLM effectively enhances the efficiency and flexibility of the security verification process. Additionally, we introduce a comprehensive hardware vulnerability database that supports this work and will further assist the research community in enhancing the security verification process.

      In enterprise settings, organizational data is segregated, siloed and carefully protected by elaborate access control frameworks. These access control structures can completely break down if an LLM fine-tuned on the siloed data serves requests, for downstream tasks, from individuals with disparate access privileges. We propose Permissioned LLMs (PermLLM), a new class of LLMs that superimpose the organizational data access control structures on query responses they generate. We formalize abstractions underpinning the means to determine whether access control enforcement happens correctly over LLM query responses. Our formalism introduces the notion of a relevant response that can be used to prove whether a PermLLM mechanism has been implemented correctly. We also introduce a novel metric, called access advantage, to empirically evaluate the efficacy of a PermLLM mechanism. We introduce three novel PermLLM mechanisms that build on Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning to achieve the desired access control. We furthermore present two instantiations of access advantage--(i) Domain Distinguishability Index (DDI) based on Membership Inference Attacks, and (ii) Utility Gap Index (UGI) based on LLM utility evaluation. We demonstrate the efficacy of our PermLLM mechanisms through extensive experiments on four public datasets (GPQA, RCV1, SimpleQA, and WMDP), in addition to evaluating the validity of DDI and UGI metrics themselves for quantifying access control in LLMs.

This response identifies these issues and proposes engineering improvements to expand CaMeL's threat coverage and operational usability.

      Purpose: With advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) for healthcare, the need arises for competitive open-source models to protect the public interest. This work contributes to the field of open medical LLMs by optimizing key stages of data preprocessing and training, while showing how to improve model safety (through DPO) and efficacy (through RAG). The evaluation methodology used, which includes four different types of tests, defines a new standard for the field. The resultant models, shown to be competitive with the best private alternatives, are released with a permisive license. Methods: Building on top of strong base models like Llama 3.1 and Qwen 2.5, Aloe Beta uses a custom dataset to enhance public data with synthetic Chain of Thought examples. The models undergo alignment with Direct Preference Optimization, emphasizing ethical and policy-aligned performance in the presence of jailbreaking attacks. Evaluation includes close-ended, open-ended, safety and human assessments, to maximize the reliability of results. Results: Recommendations are made across the entire pipeline, backed by the solid performance of the Aloe Family. These models deliver competitive performance across healthcare benchmarks and medical fields, and are often preferred by healthcare professionals. On bias and toxicity, the Aloe Beta models significantly improve safety, showing resilience to unseen jailbreaking attacks. For a responsible release, a detailed risk assessment specific to healthcare is attached to the Aloe Family models. Conclusion: The Aloe Beta models, and the recipe that leads to them, are a significant contribution to the open-source medical LLM field, offering top-of-the-line performance while maintaining high ethical requirements. This work sets a new standard for developing and reporting aligned LLMs in healthcare.

      Weight binarization has emerged as a promising strategy to drastically reduce the complexity of large language models (LLMs). It is mainly classified into two approaches: post-training binarization and finetuning with training-aware binarization methods. The first approach, while having low complexity, leads to significant loss of information from the original LLMs, resulting in poor performance. The second approach, on the other hand, relies heavily on full-precision latent weights for gradient approximation of binary weights, which not only remains suboptimal but also introduces substantial complexity. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that effectively transforms LLMs into multi-kernel Boolean parameters, for the first time, finetunes them directly in the Boolean domain, eliminating the need for expensive latent weights. This significantly reduces complexity during both finetuning and inference. Through extensive and insightful experiments across a wide range of LLMs, we demonstrate that our method outperforms recent ultra low-bit quantization and binarization methods.

      Much work has been done on conversational LLM agents which directly assist human users with tasks. We present an alternative paradigm for interacting with LLM agents, which we call "overhearing agents". These overhearing agents do not actively participate in conversation -- instead, they "listen in" on human-to-human conversations and perform background tasks or provide suggestions to assist the user. In this work, we explore the overhearing agents paradigm through the lens of Dungeons & Dragons gameplay. We present an in-depth study using large multimodal audio-language models as overhearing agents to assist a Dungeon Master. We perform a human evaluation to examine the helpfulness of such agents and find that some large audio-language models have the emergent ability to perform overhearing agent tasks using implicit audio cues. Finally, we release Python libraries and our project code to support further research into the overhearing agents paradigm at https://github.com/zhudotexe/overhearing_agents.

      We introduce Instruct-SkillMix, an automated approach for creating diverse, high quality SFT data for instruction-following. The pipeline involves two stages, each leveraging an existing powerful LLM: (1) Skill extraction: uses the LLM to extract core "skills" for instruction-following by directly prompting the model. This is inspired by ``LLM metacognition'' of Didolkar et al. (2024); (2) Data generation: uses the powerful LLM to generate (instruction, response) data that exhibit a randomly chosen pair of these skills. Here, the use of random skill combinations promotes diversity and difficulty. The estimated cost of creating the dataset is under $600. Vanilla SFT (i.e., no PPO, DPO, or RL methods) on data generated from Instruct-SkillMix leads to strong gains on instruction following benchmarks such as AlpacaEval 2.0, MT-Bench, and WildBench. With just 4K examples, LLaMA-3-8B-Base achieves 42.76% length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0, a level similar to frontier models like Claude 3 Opus and LLaMA-3.1-405B-Instruct. Ablation studies also suggest plausible reasons for why creating open instruction-tuning datasets via naive crowd-sourcing has proved difficult. In our dataset, adding 20% low quality answers (``shirkers'') causes a noticeable degradation in performance. The Instruct-SkillMix pipeline seems flexible and adaptable to other settings.

      LLMs are seeing growing use for applications which require large context windows, and with these large context windows KV cache activations surface as the dominant contributor to memory consumption during inference. Quantization is a promising approach for compressing KV cache activations; however, existing solutions fail to represent activations accurately in sub-4-bit precision. Our work, KVQuant, facilitates low precision KV cache quantization by incorporating several novel methods: (i) Per-Channel Key Quantization, where we adjust the dimension along which we quantize the Key activations to better match the distribution; (ii) Pre-RoPE Key Quantization, where we quantize Key activations before the rotary positional embedding to mitigate its impact on quantization; (iii) Non-Uniform KV Cache Quantization, where we derive per-layer sensitivity-weighted non-uniform datatypes that better represent the distributions; and (iv) Per-Vector Dense-and-Sparse Quantization, where we isolate outliers separately for each vector to minimize skews in quantization ranges. By applying our method to the LLaMA, Llama-2, Llama-3, and Mistral models, we achieve < 0.1 perplexity degradation with 3-bit quantization on both Wikitext-2 and C4, outperforming existing approaches. Our method enables serving LLaMA-7B with a context length of up to 1 million on a single A100-80GB GPU and up to 10 million on an 8-GPU system. We develop custom CUDA kernels for KVQuant, showing that we can achieve up to ~1.7x speedups, compared to baseline fp16 matrix-vector multiplications, for the LLaMA-7B model.

      As the capabilities of chatbots and their underlying LLMs continue to dramatically improve, evaluating their performance has increasingly become a major blocker to their further development. A major challenge is the available benchmarking datasets, which are largely static, outdated, and lacking in multilingual coverage, limiting their ability to capture subtle linguistic and cultural variations. This paper introduces MEDAL, an automated multi-agent framework for generating, evaluating, and curating more representative and diverse open-domain dialogue evaluation benchmarks. Our approach leverages several state-of-the-art LLMs to generate user-chatbot multilingual dialogues, conditioned on varied seed contexts. A strong LLM (GPT-4.1) is then used for a multidimensional analysis of the performance of the chatbots, uncovering noticeable cross-lingual performance differences. Guided by this large-scale evaluation, we curate a new meta-evaluation multilingual benchmark and human-annotate samples with nuanced quality judgments. This benchmark is then used to assess the ability of several reasoning and non-reasoning LLMs to act as evaluators of open-domain dialogues. We find that current LLMs struggle to detect nuanced issues, particularly those involving empathy and reasoning.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable general capabilities, but enhancing skills such as reasoning often demands substantial computational resources and may compromise their generalization. While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods offer a more resource-conscious alternative, they typically requires retraining for each LLM backbone due to architectural dependencies. To address these challenges, here we propose Universal Reasoner (UniR) - a single, lightweight, composable, and plug-and-play reasoning module that can be used with any frozen LLM to endow it with specialized reasoning capabilities. Specifically, UniR decomposes the reward into a standalone reasoning module that is trained independently using predefined rewards, effectively translating trajectory-level signals into token-level guidance. Once trained, UniR can be combined with any frozen LLM at inference time by simply adding its output logits to those of the LLM backbone. This additive structure naturally enables modular composition: multiple UniR modules trained for different tasks can be jointly applied by summing their logits, enabling complex reasoning via composition. Experimental results on mathematical reasoning and machine translation tasks show that UniR significantly outperforms existing baseline fine-tuning methods using the Llama3.2 model. Furthermore, UniR demonstrates strong weak-to-strong generalization: reasoning modules trained on smaller models effectively guide much larger LLMs. This makes UniR a cost-efficient, adaptable, and robust solution for enhancing reasoning in LLMs without compromising their core capabilities.

      The finetuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced their instruction-following capabilities, yet the underlying computational mechanisms driving these improvements remain poorly understood. This study systematically examines how fine-tuning reconfigures LLM computations by isolating and analyzing instruction-specific sparse components, i.e., neurons in dense models and both neurons and experts in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. In particular, we introduce HexaInst, a carefully curated and balanced instructional dataset spanning six distinct categories, and propose SPARCOM, a novel analytical framework comprising three key contributions: (1) a method for identifying these sparse components, (2) an evaluation of their functional generality and uniqueness, and (3) a systematic comparison of their alterations. Through experiments, we demonstrate functional generality, uniqueness, and the critical role of these components in instruction execution. By elucidating the relationship between fine-tuning-induced adaptations and sparse computational substrates, this work provides deeper insights into how LLMs internalize instruction-following behavior for the trustworthy LLM community.

      A recent study showed that large language models (LLMs) can reconstruct surprisingly long texts - up to thousands of tokens - via autoregressive generation from just one specially trained input embedding. In this work, we explore whether such reconstruction is possible without autoregression. We show that frozen LLMs can generate hundreds of accurate tokens in just one forward pass, when provided with only two learned embeddings. This reveals a surprising and underexplored capability of LLMs - multi-token generation without iterative decoding. We investigate the behaviour of these embeddings and provide insight into the type of information they encode. We also empirically show that although these representations are not unique for a given text, they form connected and local regions in embedding space - a property that suggests the potential of learning a dedicated encoder into that space.

      As test-time scaling becomes a pivotal research frontier in Large Language Models (LLMs) development, contemporary and advanced post-training methodologies increasingly focus on extending the generation length of long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) responses to enhance reasoning capabilities toward DeepSeek R1-like performance. However, recent studies reveal a persistent overthinking phenomenon in state-of-the-art reasoning models, manifesting as excessive redundancy or repetitive thinking patterns in long CoT responses. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective two-stage reinforcement learning framework for achieving concise reasoning in LLMs, named ConciseR. Specifically, the first stage, using more training steps, aims to incentivize the model's reasoning capabilities via Group Relative Policy Optimization with clip-higher and dynamic sampling components (GRPO++), and the second stage, using fewer training steps, explicitly enforces conciseness and improves efficiency via Length-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (L-GRPO). Significantly, ConciseR only optimizes response length once all rollouts of a sample are correct, following the "walk before you run" principle. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our ConciseR model, which generates more concise CoT reasoning responses, outperforms recent state-of-the-art reasoning models with zero RL paradigm across AIME 2024, MATH-500, AMC 2023, Minerva, and Olympiad benchmarks.

      Multilingual LLM performance is often critically dependent on model size. With an eye on efficiency, this has led to a surge in interest in one-shot pruning methods that retain the benefits of large-scale pretraining while shrinking the model size. However, as pruning tends to come with performance loss, it is important to understand the trade-offs between multilinguality and sparsification. In this work, we study multilingual performance under different sparsity constraints and show that moderate ratios already substantially harm performance. To help bridge this gap, we propose M-Wanda, a pruning method that models cross-lingual variation by incorporating language-aware activation statistics into its pruning criterion and dynamically adjusts layerwise sparsity based on cross-lingual importance. We show that M-Wanda consistently improves performance at minimal additional costs. We are the first to explicitly optimize pruning to retain multilingual performance, and hope to inspire future advances in multilingual pruning.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Hallucinations, a phenomenon where a language model (LM) generates nonfactual content, pose a significant challenge to the practical deployment of LMs. While many empirical methods have been proposed to mitigate hallucinations, recent studies established a computability-theoretic result showing that any LM will inevitably generate hallucinations on an infinite set of inputs, regardless of the quality and quantity of training datasets and the choice of the language model architecture and training and inference algorithms. Although the computability-theoretic result may seem pessimistic, its significance in practical viewpoints has remained unclear. This paper claims that those "innate" inevitability results from computability theory and diagonal argument, in principle, cannot explain practical issues of LLMs. We demonstrate this claim by presenting a positive theoretical result from a probabilistic perspective. Specifically, we prove that hallucinations can be made statistically negligible, provided that the quality and quantity of the training data are sufficient. Interestingly, our positive result coexists with the computability-theoretic result, implying that while hallucinations on an infinite set of inputs cannot be entirely eliminated, their probability can always be reduced by improving algorithms and training data. By evaluating the two seemingly contradictory results through the lens of information theory, we argue that our probability-theoretic positive result better reflects practical considerations than the computability-theoretic negative result.

      This paper introduces ADEPT, a system using Large Language Model (LLM) personas to simulate multi-perspective ethical debates. ADEPT assembles panels of 'AI personas', each embodying a distinct ethical framework or stakeholder perspective (like a deontologist, consequentialist, or disability rights advocate), to deliberate on complex moral issues. Its application is demonstrated through a scenario about prioritizing patients for a limited number of ventilators inspired by real-world challenges in allocating scarce medical resources. Two debates, each with six LLM personas, were conducted; they only differed in the moral viewpoints represented: one included a Catholic bioethicist and a care theorist, the other substituted a rule-based Kantian philosopher and a legal adviser. Both panels ultimately favoured the same policy -- a lottery system weighted for clinical need and fairness, crucially avoiding the withdrawal of ventilators for reallocation. However, each panel reached that conclusion through different lines of argument, and their voting coalitions shifted once duty- and rights-based voices were present. Examination of the debate transcripts shows that the altered membership redirected attention toward moral injury, legal risk and public trust, which in turn changed four continuing personas' final positions. The work offers three contributions: (i) a transparent, replicable workflow for running and analysing multi-agent AI debates in bioethics; (ii) evidence that the moral perspectives included in such panels can materially change the outcome even when the factual inputs remain constant; and (iii) an analysis of the implications and future directions for such AI-mediated approaches to ethical deliberation and policy.

      System prompts in Large Language Models (LLMs) are predefined directives that guide model behaviour, taking precedence over user inputs in text processing and generation. LLM deployers increasingly use them to ensure consistent responses across contexts. While model providers set a foundation of system prompts, deployers and third-party developers can append additional prompts without visibility into others' additions, while this layered implementation remains entirely hidden from end-users. As system prompts become more complex, they can directly or indirectly introduce unaccounted for side effects. This lack of transparency raises fundamental questions about how the position of information in different directives shapes model outputs. As such, this work examines how the placement of information affects model behaviour. To this end, we compare how models process demographic information in system versus user prompts across six commercially available LLMs and 50 demographic groups. Our analysis reveals significant biases, manifesting in differences in user representation and decision-making scenarios. Since these variations stem from inaccessible and opaque system-level configurations, they risk representational, allocative and potential other biases and downstream harms beyond the user's ability to detect or correct. Our findings draw attention to these critical issues, which have the potential to perpetuate harms if left unexamined. Further, we argue that system prompt analysis must be incorporated into AI auditing processes, particularly as customisable system prompts become increasingly prevalent in commercial AI deployments.

      Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved impressive performance across a wide range of natural language tasks and are now widely used in real-world applications. Among them, black-box LLMs--served via APIs without access to model internals--are especially dominant due to their scalability and ease of deployment. Despite their strong capabilities, these models typically produce generalized responses that overlook personal preferences and reasoning styles. This has led to growing interest in black-box LLM personalization, which aims to tailor model outputs to user-specific context without modifying model parameters. However, existing approaches primarily focus on response-level personalization, attempting to match final outputs without modeling personal thought process. To address this limitation, we propose RPM, a framework for reasoning-level personalization that aligns the model's reasoning process with a user's personalized logic. RPM first constructs statistical user-specific factors by extracting and grouping response-influential features from user history. It then builds personalized reasoning paths that reflect how these factors are used in context. In the inference stage, RPM retrieves reasoning-aligned examples for new queries via feature-level similarity and performs inference conditioned on the structured factors and retrieved reasoning paths, enabling the model to follow user-specific reasoning trajectories. This reasoning-level personalization enhances both predictive accuracy and interpretability by grounding model outputs in user-specific logic through structured information. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks show that RPM consistently outperforms response-level personalization methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of reasoning-level personalization in black-box LLMs.
