      Inference scaling further accelerates Large Language Models (LLMs) toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), with large-scale Reinforcement Learning (RL) to unleash long Chain-of-Thought reasoning. Most contemporary reasoning approaches usually rely on handcrafted rule-based reward functions. However, the tarde-offs of exploration and exploitation in RL algorithms involves multiple complex considerations, and the theoretical and empirical impacts of manually designed reward functions remain insufficiently explored. In this paper, we propose Decoupled Group Reward Optimization (DGRO), a general RL algorithm for LLM reasoning. On the one hand, DGRO decouples the traditional regularization coefficient into two independent hyperparameters: one scales the policy gradient term, and the other regulates the distance from the sampling policy. This decoupling not only enables precise control over balancing exploration and exploitation, but also can be seamlessly extended to Online Policy Mirror Descent (OPMD) algorithms in Kimi k1.5 and Direct Reward Optimization. On the other hand, we observe that reward variance significantly affects both convergence speed and final model performance. We conduct both theoretical analysis and extensive empirical validation to assess DGRO, including a detailed ablation study that investigates its performance and optimization dynamics. Experimental results show that DGRO achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Logic dataset with an average accuracy of 96.9\%, and demonstrates strong generalization across mathematical benchmarks.

      Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive abilities in numerous domains, but exhibit inconsistent performance in response to minor input changes. Rather than view this as a drawback, in this paper we introduce a novel method for leveraging models' inconsistency to boost Pass@k performance. Specifically, we present a "Variator" agent that generates k variants of a given task and submits one candidate solution for each one. Our variant generation approach is applicable to a wide range of domains as it is task agnostic and compatible with free-form inputs. We demonstrate the efficacy of our agent theoretically using a probabilistic model of the inconsistency effect, and show empirically that it outperforms the baseline on the APPS dataset. Furthermore, we establish that inconsistency persists even in frontier reasoning models across coding and cybersecurity domains, suggesting our method is likely to remain relevant for future model generations.

      Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a cornerstone for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), with recent innovations such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) demonstrating exceptional effectiveness. In this study, we identify a critical yet underexplored issue in RL training: low-probability tokens disproportionately influence model updates due to their large gradient magnitudes. This dominance hinders the effective learning of high-probability tokens, whose gradients are essential for LLMs' performance but are substantially suppressed. To mitigate this interference, we propose two novel methods: Advantage Reweighting and Low-Probability Token Isolation (Lopti), both of which effectively attenuate gradients from low-probability tokens while emphasizing parameter updates driven by high-probability tokens. Our approaches promote balanced updates across tokens with varying probabilities, thereby enhancing the efficiency of RL training. Experimental results demonstrate that they substantially improve the performance of GRPO-trained LLMs, achieving up to a 46.2% improvement in K&K Logic Puzzle reasoning tasks.

      Efficient LLM inference on resource-constrained devices presents significant challenges in compute and memory utilization. Due to limited GPU memory, existing systems offload model weights to CPU memory, incurring substantial I/O overhead between the CPU and GPU. This leads to two major inefficiencies: (1) GPU cores are underutilized, often remaining idle while waiting for data to be loaded; and (2) GPU memory has low impact on performance, as reducing its capacity has minimal effect on overall throughput.In this paper, we propose SpecOffload, a high-throughput inference engine that embeds speculative decoding into offloading. Our key idea is to unlock latent GPU resources for storing and executing a draft model used for speculative decoding, thus accelerating inference at near-zero additional cost. To support this, we carefully orchestrate the interleaved execution of target and draft models in speculative decoding within the offloading pipeline, and propose a planner to manage tensor placement and select optimal parameters. Compared to the best baseline, SpecOffload improves GPU core utilization by 4.49x and boosts inference throughput by 2.54x. Our code is available at https://github.com/MobiSense/SpecOffload .

      The remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has illuminated a promising pathway toward achieving Artificial General Intelligence for both academic and industrial communities, owing to their unprecedented performance across various applications. As LLMs continue to gain prominence in both research and commercial domains, their security and safety implications have become a growing concern, not only for researchers and corporations but also for every nation. Currently, existing surveys on LLM safety primarily focus on specific stages of the LLM lifecycle, e.g., deployment phase or fine-tuning phase, lacking a comprehensive understanding of the entire "lifechain" of LLMs. To address this gap, this paper introduces, for the first time, the concept of "full-stack" safety to systematically consider safety issues throughout the entire process of LLM training, deployment, and eventual commercialization. Compared to the off-the-shelf LLM safety surveys, our work demonstrates several distinctive advantages: (I) Comprehensive Perspective. We define the complete LLM lifecycle as encompassing data preparation, pre-training, post-training, deployment and final commercialization. To our knowledge, this represents the first safety survey to encompass the entire lifecycle of LLMs. (II) Extensive Literature Support. Our research is grounded in an exhaustive review of over 800+ papers, ensuring comprehensive coverage and systematic organization of security issues within a more holistic understanding. (III) Unique Insights. Through systematic literature analysis, we have developed reliable roadmaps and perspectives for each chapter. Our work identifies promising research directions, including safety in data generation, alignment techniques, model editing, and LLM-based agent systems. These insights provide valuable guidance for researchers pursuing future work in this field.

      Temporal reasoning is pivotal for Large Language Models (LLMs) to comprehend the real world. However, existing works neglect the real-world challenges for temporal reasoning: (1) intensive temporal information, (2) fast-changing event dynamics, and (3) complex temporal dependencies in social interactions. To bridge this gap, we propose a multi-level benchmark TIME, designed for temporal reasoning in real-world scenarios. TIME consists of 38,522 QA pairs, covering 3 levels with 11 fine-grained sub-tasks. This benchmark encompasses 3 sub-datasets reflecting different real-world challenges: TIME-Wiki, TIME-News, and TIME-Dial. We conduct extensive experiments on reasoning models and non-reasoning models. And we conducted an in-depth analysis of temporal reasoning performance across diverse real-world scenarios and tasks, and summarized the impact of test-time scaling on temporal reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we release TIME-Lite, a human-annotated subset to foster future research and standardized evaluation in temporal reasoning.

      Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are extensively used in critical infrastructures ensuring efficient, reliable, and continuous operations. However, their increasing connectivity and addition of advanced features make them vulnerable to cyber threats, potentially leading to severe disruptions in essential services. In this context, honeypots play a vital role by acting as decoy targets within ICS networks, or on the Internet, helping to detect, log, analyze, and develop mitigations for ICS-specific cyber threats. Deploying ICS honeypots, however, is challenging due to the necessity of accurately replicating industrial protocols and device characteristics, a crucial requirement for effectively mimicking the unique operational behavior of different industrial systems. Moreover, this challenge is compounded by the significant manual effort required in also mimicking the control logic the PLC would execute, in order to capture attacker traffic aiming to disrupt critical infrastructure operations. In this paper, we propose LLMPot, a novel approach for designing honeypots in ICS networks harnessing the potency of Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMPot aims to automate and optimize the creation of realistic honeypots with vendor-agnostic configurations, and for any control logic, aiming to eliminate the manual effort and specialized knowledge traditionally required in this domain. We conducted extensive experiments focusing on a wide array of parameters, demonstrating that our LLM-based approach can effectively create honeypot devices implementing different industrial protocols and diverse control logic.

      Many real-world scientific and industrial applications require the optimization of expensive black-box functions. Bayesian Optimization (BO) provides an effective framework for such problems. However, traditional BO methods are prone to get trapped in local optima and often lack interpretable insights. To address this issue, this paper designs Reasoning BO, a novel framework that leverages reasoning models to guide the sampling process in BO while incorporating multi-agent systems and knowledge graphs for online knowledge accumulation. By integrating the reasoning and contextual understanding capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we can provide strong guidance to enhance the BO process. As the optimization progresses, Reasoning BO provides real-time sampling recommendations along with critical insights grounded in plausible scientific theories, aiding in the discovery of superior solutions within the search space. We systematically evaluate our approach across 10 diverse tasks encompassing synthetic mathematical functions and complex real-world applications. The framework demonstrates its capability to progressively refine sampling strategies through real-time insights and hypothesis evolution, effectively identifying higher-performing regions of the search space for focused exploration. This process highlights the powerful reasoning and context-learning abilities of LLMs in optimization scenarios. For example, in the Direct Arylation task, our method increased the yield to 60.7%, whereas traditional BO achieved only a 25.2% yield. Furthermore, our investigation reveals that smaller LLMs, when fine-tuned through reinforcement learning, can attain comparable performance to their larger counterparts. This enhanced reasoning capability paves the way for more efficient automated scientific experimentation while maintaining computational feasibility.

      Extracting sentence embeddings from large language models (LLMs) is a practical direction, as it requires neither additional data nor fine-tuning. Previous studies usually focus on prompt engineering to guide LLMs to encode the core semantic information of the sentence into the embedding of the last token. However, the last token in these methods still encodes an excess of non-essential information, such as stop words, limiting its encoding capacity. To this end, we propose a Contrastive Prompting (CP) method that introduces an extra auxiliary prompt to elicit better sentence embedding. By contrasting with the auxiliary prompt, CP can steer existing prompts to encode the core semantics of the sentence, rather than non-essential information. CP is a plug-and-play inference-time intervention method that can be combined with various prompt-based methods. Extensive experiments on Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) tasks and downstream classification tasks demonstrate that our method can improve the performance of existing prompt-based methods across different LLMs. Our code will be released at https://github.com/zifengcheng/CP.

      Existing LLM-based role-playing methods often rely on superficial textual descriptions or simplistic metrics, inadequately modeling both intrinsic and extrinsic character dimensions. Additionally, they typically simulate character memory with implicit model knowledge or basic retrieval augment generation without explicit memory alignment, compromising memory consistency. The two issues weaken reliability of role-playing LLMs in several applications, such as trustworthy social simulation. To address these limitations, we propose PsyMem, a novel framework integrating fine-grained psychological attributes and explicit memory control for role-playing. PsyMem supplements textual descriptions with 26 psychological indicators to detailed model character. Additionally, PsyMem implements memory alignment training, explicitly trains the model to align character's response with memory, thereby enabling dynamic memory-controlled responding during inference. By training Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on our specially designed dataset (including 5,414 characters and 38,962 dialogues extracted from novels), the resulting model, termed as PsyMem-Qwen, outperforms baseline models in role-playing, achieving the best performance in human-likeness and character fidelity.

      The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized various fields, including the identification and discovery of human values within text data. While traditional NLP models, such as BERT, have been employed for this task, their ability to represent textual data is significantly outperformed by emerging LLMs like GPTs. However, the performance of online LLMs often degrades when handling long contexts required for value identification, which also incurs substantial computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose EAVIT, an efficient and accurate framework for human value identification that combines the strengths of both locally fine-tunable and online black-box LLMs. Our framework employs a value detector - a small, local language model - to generate initial value estimations. These estimations are then used to construct concise input prompts for online LLMs, enabling accurate final value identification. To train the value detector, we introduce explanation-based training and data generation techniques specifically tailored for value identification, alongside sampling strategies to optimize the brevity of LLM input prompts. Our approach effectively reduces the number of input tokens by up to 1/6 compared to directly querying online LLMs, while consistently outperforming traditional NLP methods and other LLM-based strategies.

      Serving LLMs with a cluster of GPUs is common nowadays, where the serving system must meet strict latency SLOs required by applications. However, the stateful nature of LLM serving requires maintaining huge states (i.e., KVCache) in limited GPU memory. Under spikes in real-world workloads, GPU memory can be easily throttled, leading to orders of magnitude higher response latency due to queuing introduced by waiting for KVCache to be reclaimed. Prior KVCache-centric approaches handle load throttling by dropping, migrating, or swapping KVCache. These methods fail to release sufficient memory quickly with requests still queued. This paper proposes the first parameter-centric approach to handling throttling by selectively dropping replicated parameters to instantly free memory for requests, based on an unnoticed observation that model parameters are commonly replicated across GPUs for serving LLMs. With additional memory, all requests can be served with a larger batch without queuing. To make the parameter-centric approach correct and efficient, we cooperatively execute requests on GPUs with a complete copy of parameters using pipeline parallelism, and derive an appropriate drop plan without unnecessary cooperation. We also design techniques to minimize the performance overhead due to pipeline parallelism with the execution patterns of requests under drop. Evaluations show that {\sys} reduces the tail TTFT of requests under throttling by up to 72.2 times compared to the state-of-the-art systems including Llumnix, vLLM and InferCept.

      Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate significant reasoning capabilities, particularly through long chain-of-thought (CoT) processes, which can be elicited by reinforcement learning (RL). However, prolonged CoT reasoning presents limitations, primarily verbose outputs due to excessive introspection. The reasoning process in these LLMs often appears to follow a trial-and-error methodology rather than a systematic, logical deduction. In contrast, tree-of-thoughts (ToT) offers a conceptually more advanced approach by modeling reasoning as an exploration within a tree structure. This reasoning structure facilitates the parallel generation and evaluation of multiple reasoning branches, allowing for the active identification, assessment, and pruning of unproductive paths. This process can potentially lead to improved performance and reduced token costs. Building upon the long CoT capability of LLMs, we introduce tree-of-thoughts RL (ToTRL), a novel on-policy RL framework with a rule-based reward. ToTRL is designed to guide LLMs in developing the parallel ToT strategy based on the sequential CoT strategy. Furthermore, we employ LLMs as players in a puzzle game during the ToTRL training process. Solving puzzle games inherently necessitates exploring interdependent choices and managing multiple constraints, which requires the construction and exploration of a thought tree, providing challenging tasks for cultivating the ToT reasoning capability. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that our ToTQwen3-8B model, trained with our ToTRL, achieves significant improvement in performance and reasoning efficiency on complex reasoning tasks.

      Query expansion (QE) enhances retrieval by incorporating relevant terms, with large language models (LLMs) offering an effective alternative to traditional rule-based and statistical methods. However, LLM-based QE suffers from a fundamental limitation: it often fails to generate relevant knowledge, degrading search performance. Prior studies have focused on hallucination, yet its underlying cause--LLM knowledge deficiencies--remains underexplored. This paper systematically examines two failure cases in LLM-based QE: (1) when the LLM lacks query knowledge, leading to incorrect expansions, and (2) when the query is ambiguous, causing biased refinements that narrow search coverage. We conduct controlled experiments across multiple datasets, evaluating the effects of knowledge and query ambiguity on retrieval performance using sparse and dense retrieval models. Our results reveal that LLM-based QE can significantly degrade the retrieval effectiveness when knowledge in the LLM is insufficient or query ambiguity is high. We introduce a framework for evaluating QE under these conditions, providing insights into the limitations of LLM-based retrieval augmentation.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in interactions where they are prompted to adopt personas. This paper investigates whether such persona conditioning affects model safety under bullying, an adversarial manipulation that applies psychological pressures in order to force the victim to comply to the attacker. We introduce a simulation framework in which an attacker LLM engages a victim LLM using psychologically grounded bullying tactics, while the victim adopts personas aligned with the Big Five personality traits. Experiments using multiple open-source LLMs and a wide range of adversarial goals reveal that certain persona configurations -- such as weakened agreeableness or conscientiousness -- significantly increase victim's susceptibility to unsafe outputs. Bullying tactics involving emotional or sarcastic manipulation, such as gaslighting and ridicule, are particularly effective. These findings suggest that persona-driven interaction introduces a novel vector for safety risks in LLMs and highlight the need for persona-aware safety evaluation and alignment strategies.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a new paradigm for recommendation by converting interacted item history into language modeling. However, constrained by the limited context length of LLMs, existing approaches have to truncate item history in the prompt, focusing only on recent interactions and sacrificing the ability to model long-term history. To enable LLMs to model long histories, we pursue a concise embedding representation for items and sessions. In the LLM embedding space, we construct an item's embedding by aggregating its textual token embeddings; similarly, we construct a session's embedding by aggregating its item embeddings. While efficient, this way poses two challenges since it ignores the temporal significance of user interactions and LLMs do not natively interpret our custom embeddings. To overcome these, we propose PatchRec, a multi-grained patch training method consisting of two stages: (1) Patch Pre-training, which familiarizes LLMs with aggregated embeddings -- patches, and (2) Patch Fine-tuning, which enables LLMs to capture time-aware significance in interaction history. Extensive experiments show that PatchRec effectively models longer behavior histories with improved efficiency. This work facilitates the practical use of LLMs for modeling long behavior histories.

      Reward models (RMs) play a pivotal role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. However, noisy preferences in human feedback can lead to reward misgeneralization - a phenomenon where reward models learn spurious correlations or overfit to noisy preferences, which poses important challenges to the generalization of RMs. This paper systematically analyzes the characteristics of preference pairs and aims to identify how noisy preferences differ from human-aligned preferences in reward modeling. Our analysis reveals that noisy preferences are difficult for RMs to fit, as they cause sharp training fluctuations and irregular gradient updates. These distinctive dynamics suggest the feasibility of identifying and excluding such noisy preferences. Empirical studies demonstrate that policy LLM optimized with a reward model trained on the full preference dataset, which includes substantial noise, performs worse than the one trained on a subset of exclusively high quality preferences. To address this challenge, we propose an online Collaborative Reward Modeling (CRM) framework to achieve robust preference learning through peer review and curriculum learning. In particular, CRM maintains two RMs that collaboratively filter potential noisy preferences by peer-reviewing each other's data selections. Curriculum learning synchronizes the capabilities of two models, mitigating excessive disparities to promote the utility of peer review. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CRM significantly enhances RM generalization, with up to 9.94 points improvement on RewardBench under an extreme 40\% noise. Moreover, CRM can seamlessly extend to implicit-reward alignment methods, offering a robust and versatile alignment strategy.

      The ReAct (Reasoning + Action) capability in large language models (LLMs) has become the foundation of modern agentic systems. Recent LLMs, such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1/o3, exemplify this by emphasizing reasoning through the generation of ample intermediate tokens, which help build a strong premise before producing the final output tokens. In this paper, we introduce Pre-Act, a novel approach that enhances the agent's performance by creating a multi-step execution plan along with the detailed reasoning for the given user input. This plan incrementally incorporates previous steps and tool outputs, refining itself after each step execution until the final response is obtained. Our approach is applicable to both conversational and non-conversational agents. To measure the performance of task-oriented agents comprehensively, we propose a two-level evaluation framework: (1) turn level and (2) end-to-end. Our turn-level evaluation, averaged across five models, shows that our approach, Pre-Act, outperforms ReAct by 70% in Action Recall on the Almita dataset. While this approach is effective for larger models, smaller models crucial for practical applications, where latency and cost are key constraints, often struggle with complex reasoning tasks required for agentic systems. To address this limitation, we fine-tune relatively small models such as Llama 3.1 (8B & 70B) using the proposed Pre-Act approach. Our experiments show that the fine-tuned 70B model outperforms GPT-4, achieving a 69.5% improvement in action accuracy (turn-level) and a 28% improvement in goal completion rate (end-to-end) on the Almita (out-of-domain) dataset.

      Recent advancements in instruction tuning for large language models (LLMs) suggest that a small, high-quality dataset can significantly equip LLMs with instruction-following capabilities, outperforming large datasets often burdened by quality and redundancy issues. However, the challenge lies in automatically identifying valuable subsets from large datasets to boost both the effectiveness and efficiency of instruction tuning. In this paper, we first establish data selection criteria based on three distinct aspects of data value: diversity, difficulty, and dependability, and then propose the D3 method comprising two key steps of scoring and selection. Specifically, in the scoring step, we define the diversity function to measure sample distinctiveness and introduce the uncertainty-based prediction difficulty to evaluate sample difficulty by mitigating the interference of context-oriented generation diversity. Additionally, we integrate an external LLM for dependability assessment. In the selection step, we formulate the D3 weighted coreset objective, which jointly optimizes three aspects of data value to solve for the most valuable subset. The two steps of D3 can iterate multiple rounds, incorporating feedback to refine the selection focus adaptively. Experiments on both public datasets and the real-world Taobao Live application demonstrate the effectiveness of D3 in endowing LLMs with competitive or even superior instruction-following capabilities using less than 10\% of the entire dataset.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in various science domains, yet their broader adoption remains constrained by a critical challenge: the lack of trustworthy, verifiable outputs. Current LLMs often generate answers without reliable source attribution, or worse, with incorrect attributions, posing a barrier to their use in scientific and high-stakes settings, where traceability and accountability are non-negotiable. To be reliable, attribution systems need high accuracy and retrieve data with short lengths, i.e., attribute to a sentence within a document rather than a whole document. We propose a sentence-level pre-attribution step for Retrieve-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems that classify sentences into three categories: not attributable, attributable to a single quote, and attributable to multiple quotes. By separating sentences before attribution, a proper attribution method can be selected for the type of sentence, or the attribution can be skipped altogether. Our results indicate that classifiers are well-suited for this task. In this work, we propose a pre-attribution step to reduce the computational complexity of attribution, provide a clean version of the HAGRID dataset, and provide an end-to-end attribution system that works out of the box.

      The integrity of peer review is fundamental to scientific progress, but the rise of large language models (LLMs) has introduced concerns that some reviewers may rely on these tools to generate reviews rather than writing them independently. Although some venues have banned LLM-assisted reviewing, enforcement remains difficult as existing detection tools cannot reliably distinguish between fully generated reviews and those merely polished with AI assistance. In this work, we address the challenge of detecting LLM-generated reviews. We consider the approach of performing indirect prompt injection via the paper's PDF, prompting the LLM to embed a covert watermark in the generated review, and subsequently testing for presence of the watermark in the review. We identify and address several pitfalls in na\"ive implementations of this approach. Our primary contribution is a rigorous watermarking and detection framework that offers strong statistical guarantees. Specifically, we introduce watermarking schemes and hypothesis tests that control the family-wise error rate across multiple reviews, achieving higher statistical power than standard corrections such as Bonferroni, while making no assumptions about the nature of human-written reviews. We explore multiple indirect prompt injection strategies--including font-based embedding and obfuscated prompts--and evaluate their effectiveness under various reviewer defense scenarios. Our experiments find high success rates in watermark embedding across various LLMs. We also empirically find that our approach is resilient to common reviewer defenses, and that the bounds on error rates in our statistical tests hold in practice. In contrast, we find that Bonferroni-style corrections are too conservative to be useful in this setting.

      As large language models (LLMs) grow in scale and specialization, routing--selecting the best model for a given input--has become essential for efficient and effective deployment. While recent methods rely on complex learned routing strategies, their dependence on disparate training data and evaluation setups makes comparison and generalization difficult. In this work, we revisit LLM routing through the lens of simplicity. We show that a well-tuned k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) approach not only matches but often outperforms state-of-the-art learned routers across diverse tasks. To support systematic evaluation, we introduce a suite of standardized routing benchmarks spanning instruction-following, question-answering, and reasoning tasks, as well as the first multi-modal routing dataset involving visual inputs. Our findings reveal that the locality properties of model performance in embedding space enable simple non-parametric methods to achieve strong routing decisions with lower sample complexity than parametric approaches. This challenges the prevailing trend toward sophisticated architectures and highlights the importance of thoroughly evaluating simple baselines before investing in complex solutions. To support reproducibility and further exploration, we will release all benchmarks and code upon publication.

      As post-training techniques evolve, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly augmented with structured multi-step reasoning abilities, often optimized through reinforcement learning. These reasoning-enhanced models outperform standard LLMs on complex tasks and now underpin many commercial LLM APIs. However, to protect proprietary behavior and reduce verbosity, providers typically conceal the reasoning traces while returning only the final answer. This opacity introduces a critical transparency gap: users are billed for invisible reasoning tokens, which often account for the majority of the cost, yet have no means to verify their authenticity. This opens the door to token count inflation, where providers may overreport token usage or inject synthetic, low-effort tokens to inflate charges. To address this issue, we propose CoIn, a verification framework that audits both the quantity and semantic validity of hidden tokens. CoIn constructs a verifiable hash tree from token embedding fingerprints to check token counts, and uses embedding-based relevance matching to detect fabricated reasoning content. Experiments demonstrate that CoIn, when deployed as a trusted third-party auditor, can effectively detect token count inflation with a success rate reaching up to 94.7%, showing the strong ability to restore billing transparency in opaque LLM services.

However, evaluating how faithfully these agents adhere to their personas remains a significant challenge, particularly in free-form settings that demand consistency across diverse, persona-relevant environments. We introduce PersonaGym, the first dynamic evaluation framework for persona agents, and PersonaScore, a human-aligned automatic metric grounded in decision theory that enables comprehensive large-scale evaluation. Our evaluation of 10 leading LLMs across 200 personas and 10,000 questions reveals significant advancement opportunities. For example, GPT-4.1 had the exact same PersonaScore as LLaMA-3-8b despite being a more recent and advanced closed source model.

      Reliable causal inference is essential for making decisions in high-stakes areas like medicine, economics, and public policy. However, it remains unclear whether large language models (LLMs) can handle rigorous and trustworthy statistical causal inference. Current benchmarks usually involve simplified tasks. For example, these tasks might only ask LLMs to identify semantic causal relationships or draw conclusions directly from raw data. As a result, models may overlook important statistical pitfalls, such as Simpson's paradox or selection bias. This oversight limits the applicability of LLMs in the real world. To address these limitations, we propose CausalPitfalls, a comprehensive benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the capability of LLMs in overcoming common causal inference pitfalls. Our benchmark features structured challenges across multiple difficulty levels, each paired with grading rubrics. This approach allows us to quantitatively measure both causal reasoning capabilities and the reliability of LLMs' responses. We evaluate models using two protocols: (1) direct prompting, which assesses intrinsic causal reasoning, and (2) code-assisted prompting, where models generate executable code for explicit statistical analysis. Additionally, we validate the effectiveness of this judge by comparing its scoring with assessments from human experts. Our results reveal significant limitations in current LLMs when performing statistical causal inference. The CausalPitfalls benchmark provides essential guidance and quantitative metrics to advance the development of trustworthy causal reasoning systems.

      Software Quality Assurance (SQA) is critical for delivering reliable, secure, and efficient software products. The Software Quality Assurance Process aims to provide assurance that work products and processes comply with predefined provisions and plans. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) present new opportunities to enhance existing SQA processes by automating tasks like requirement analysis, code review, test generation, and compliance checks. Simultaneously, established standards such as ISO/IEC 12207, ISO/IEC 25010, ISO/IEC 5055, ISO 9001/ISO/IEC 90003, CMMI, and TMM provide structured frameworks for ensuring robust quality practices. This paper surveys the intersection of LLM-based SQA methods and these recognized standards, highlighting how AI-driven solutions can augment traditional approaches while maintaining compliance and process maturity. We first review the foundational software quality standards and the technical fundamentals of LLMs in software engineering. Next, we explore various LLM-based SQA applications, including requirement validation, defect detection, test generation, and documentation maintenance. We then map these applications to key software quality frameworks, illustrating how LLMs can address specific requirements and metrics within each standard. Empirical case studies and open-source initiatives demonstrate the practical viability of these methods. At the same time, discussions on challenges (e.g., data privacy, model bias, explainability) underscore the need for deliberate governance and auditing. Finally, we propose future directions encompassing adaptive learning, privacy-focused deployments, multimodal analysis, and evolving standards for AI-driven software quality.

      Understanding the internal mechanisms of large language models (LLMs) is integral to enhancing their reliability, interpretability, and inference processes. We present Constituent-Aware Pooling (CAP), a methodology designed to analyse how LLMs process compositional linguistic structures. Grounded in principles of compositionality, mechanistic interpretability, and information theory, CAP systematically intervenes in model activations through constituent-based pooling at various model levels. Our experiments on inverse definition modelling, hypernym and synonym prediction reveal critical insights into transformers' limitations in handling compositional abstractions. No specific layer integrates tokens into unified semantic representations based on their constituent parts. We observe fragmented information processing, which intensifies with model size, suggesting that larger models struggle more with these interventions and exhibit greater information dispersion. This fragmentation likely stems from transformers' training objectives and architectural design, preventing systematic and cohesive representations. Our findings highlight fundamental limitations in current transformer architectures regarding compositional semantics processing and model interpretability, underscoring the critical need for novel approaches in LLM design to address these challenges.

      Scientific retrieval is essential for advancing academic discovery. Within this process, document reranking plays a critical role by refining first-stage retrieval results. However, large language model (LLM) listwise reranking faces unique challenges in the scientific domain. First-stage retrieval is often suboptimal in the scientific domain, so relevant documents are ranked lower. Moreover, conventional listwise reranking uses the full text of candidate documents in the context window, limiting the number of candidates that can be considered. As a result, many relevant documents are excluded before reranking, which constrains overall retrieval performance. To address these challenges, we explore compact document representations based on semantic features such as categories, sections, and keywords, and propose a training-free, model-agnostic reranking framework for scientific retrieval called CoRank. The framework involves three stages: (i) offline extraction of document-level features, (ii) coarse reranking using these compact representations, and (iii) fine-grained reranking on full texts of the top candidates from stage (ii). This hybrid design provides a high-level abstraction of document semantics, expands candidate coverage, and retains critical details required for precise ranking. Experiments on LitSearch and CSFCube show that CoRank significantly improves reranking performance across different LLM backbones, increasing nDCG@10 from 32.0 to 39.7. Overall, these results highlight the value of information extraction for reranking in scientific retrieval.

      Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enhances mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs) by enabling detailed step-by-step solutions. However, due to the verbosity of LLMs, the resulting reasoning chains can be long, making it harder to verify the reasoning steps and trace issues resulting from dependencies between the steps that may be farther away in the sequence of steps. Importantly, mathematical reasoning allows each step to be derived from a small set of premises, which are a subset of the preceding steps in the reasoning chain. In this paper, we present a framework that identifies the premises for each step, to improve the evaluation of reasoning. We restructure conventional linear reasoning chains into Premise Augmented Reasoning Chains (PARC) by introducing premise links, resulting in a directed acyclic graph where the nodes are the steps and the edges are the premise links. Through experiments with a PARC-based dataset that we built, namely PERL (Premises and ERrors identification in LLMs), we demonstrate that LLMs can reliably identify premises within complex reasoning chains. In particular, even open-source LLMs achieve 90% recall in premise identification. We also show that PARC helps to identify errors in reasoning chains more reliably. The accuracy of error identification improves by 6% to 16% absolute when step-by-step verification is carried out in PARC under the premises. Our findings highlight the utility of premise-centric representations in addressing complex problem-solving tasks and open new avenues for improving the reliability of LLM-based reasoning evaluations.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) generate text by sampling the next token from a probability distribution over the vocabulary at each decoding step. Popular sampling methods like top-p (nucleus sampling) often struggle to balance quality and diversity, especially at higher temperatures which lead to incoherent or repetitive outputs. We propose min-p sampling, a dynamic truncation method that adjusts the sampling threshold based on the model's confidence by using the top token's probability as a scaling factor. Our experiments on benchmarks including GPQA, GSM8K, and AlpacaEval Creative Writing show that min-p sampling improves both the quality and diversity of generated text across different model families (Mistral and Llama 3) and model sizes (1B to 123B parameters), especially at higher temperatures. Human evaluations further show a clear preference for min-p sampling, in both text quality and creativity. Min-p sampling has been adopted by popular open-source LLM frameworks, including Hugging Face Transformers, VLLM, and many others, highlighting its considerable impact on improving text generation quality.

      Efficient LLM pre-training requires well-tuned hyperparameters (HPs), including learning rate {\eta} and weight decay {\lambda}. We study scaling laws for HPs: formulas for how to scale HPs as we scale model size N, dataset size D, and batch size B. Recent work suggests the AdamW timescale, B/({\eta}{\lambda}D), should remain constant across training settings, and we verify the implication that optimal {\lambda} scales linearly with B, for a fixed N,D. However, as N,D scale, we show the optimal timescale obeys a precise power law in the tokens-per-parameter ratio, D/N. This law thus provides a method to accurately predict {\lambda}opt in advance of large-scale training. We also study scaling laws for optimal batch size Bopt (the B enabling lowest loss at a given N,D) and critical batch size Bcrit (the B beyond which further data parallelism becomes ineffective). In contrast with prior work, we find both Bopt and Bcrit scale as power laws in D, independent of model size, N. Finally, we analyze how these findings inform the real-world selection of Pareto-optimal N and D under dual training time and compute objectives.

      We interact with computers on an everyday basis, be it in everyday life or work, and many aspects of work can be done entirely with access to a computer and the Internet. At the same time, thanks to improvements in large language models (LLMs), there has also been a rapid development in AI agents that interact with and affect change in their surrounding environments. But how performant are AI agents at accelerating or even autonomously performing work-related tasks? The answer to this question has important implications both for industry looking to adopt AI into their workflows and for economic policy to understand the effects that adoption of AI may have on the labor market. To measure the progress of these LLM agents' performance on performing real-world professional tasks, in this paper we introduce TheAgentCompany, an extensible benchmark for evaluating AI agents that interact with the world in similar ways to those of a digital worker: by browsing the Web, writing code, running programs, and communicating with other coworkers. We build a self-contained environment with internal web sites and data that mimics a small software company environment, and create a variety of tasks that may be performed by workers in such a company. We test baseline agents powered by both closed API-based and open-weights language models (LMs), and find that the most competitive agent can complete 30% of tasks autonomously. This paints a nuanced picture on task automation with LM agents--in a setting simulating a real workplace, a good portion of simpler tasks could be solved autonomously, but more difficult long-horizon tasks are still beyond the reach of current systems.

Toward understanding underlying causes, we reframe the unlearning process as backdoor attacks and defenses: forget-tokens act as backdoor triggers that, when activated in retain-queries, cause disruptions in unlearned models' behaviors, similar to successful backdoor attacks. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose Random Noise Augmentation (RNA) -- a plug-and-play, model and method agnostic approach with theoretical guarantees for improving the robustness of unlearned models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RNA significantly improves the robustness of unlearned models, maintains unlearning performances while introducing no additional computational overhead.

      Reinforcement learning-based post-training of large language models (LLMs) has recently gained attention, particularly following the release of DeepSeek R1, which applied GRPO for fine-tuning. Amid the growing hype around improved reasoning abilities attributed to RL post-training, we critically examine the formulation and assumptions underlying these methods. We start by highlighting the popular structural assumptions made in modeling LLM training as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and show how they lead to a degenerate MDP that doesn't quite need the RL/GRPO apparatus. The two critical structural assumptions include (1) making the MDP states be just a concatenation of the actions-with states becoming the context window and the actions becoming the tokens in LLMs and (2) splitting the reward of a state-action trajectory uniformly across the trajectory. Through a comprehensive analysis, we demonstrate that these simplifying assumptions make the approach effectively equivalent to an outcome-driven supervised learning. Our experiments on benchmarks including GSM8K and Countdown using Qwen-2.5 base models show that iterative supervised fine-tuning, incorporating both positive and negative samples, achieves performance comparable to GRPO-based training. We will also argue that the structural assumptions indirectly incentivize the RL to generate longer sequences of intermediate tokens-which in turn feeds into the narrative of "RL generating longer thinking traces." While RL may well be a very useful technique for improving the reasoning abilities of LLMs, our analysis shows that the simplistic structural assumptions made in modeling the underlying MDP render the popular LLM RL frameworks and their interpretations questionable.

      Alignment algorithms are widely used to align large language models (LLMs) to human users based on preference annotations. Typically these (often divergent) preferences are aggregated over a diverse set of users, resulting in fine-tuned models that are aligned to the ``average-user'' preference. Nevertheless, current models are used by individual users in very specific contexts and situations, emphasizing the need for user-dependent preference control. In this work we address the problem of personalizing LLM outputs to their users. We aim to generate customized responses tailored to specific individuals instead of generic outputs that emulate the collective voices of diverse populations. We propose HyPerAlign, an interpretable and sample-efficient hypothesis-driven personalization approach for LLM models. Given few-shot examples written by a particular user, we first infer hypotheses about their communication strategies, personality, and writing style, then prompt LLM models with these hypotheses and user-specific attributes to generate customized outputs. We conduct experiments on two different personalization tasks, namely authorship attribution and deliberative alignment, with datasets from diverse domains (news articles, blog posts, emails, jailbreaking benchmarks). Results demonstrate the superiority of hypothesis-driven LLM personalization compared to preference-based fine-tuning methods. For authorship attribution, HyPerAlign generations have consistently high win-rates (commonly $> 90\%$) against state-of-the-art preference fine-tuning approaches across diverse user profiles and LLM models. For deliberative alignment, the helpfulness of LLM models is improved by up to $70\%$ on average. Overall, HyPerAlign represents an interpretable and sample-efficient strategy for the personalization of LLM models to individual users.

LLMs are trained primarily on text--as such, evaluating their metalinguistic abilities improves our understanding of their general capabilities and sheds new light on theoretical models in linguistics. We show that OpenAI's (2024) o1 vastly outperforms other models on tasks involving drawing syntactic trees and phonological generalization. We speculate that OpenAI o1's unique advantage over other models may result from the model's chain-of-thought mechanism, which mimics the structure of human reasoning used in complex cognitive tasks, such as linguistic analysis.

      Explainable AI (XAI) refers to techniques that provide human-understandable insights into the workings of AI models. Recently, the focus of XAI is being extended toward explaining Large Language Models (LLMs). This extension calls for a significant transformation in the XAI methodologies for two reasons. First, many existing XAI methods cannot be directly applied to LLMs due to their complexity and advanced capabilities. Second, as LLMs are increasingly deployed in diverse applications, the role of XAI shifts from merely opening the ``black box'' to actively enhancing the productivity and applicability of LLMs in real-world settings. Meanwhile, the conversation and generation abilities of LLMs can reciprocally enhance XAI. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce Usable XAI in the context of LLMs by analyzing (1) how XAI can explain and improve LLM-based AI systems and (2) how XAI techniques can be improved by using LLMs. We introduce 10 strategies, introducing the key techniques for each and discussing their associated challenges. We also provide case studies to demonstrate how to obtain and leverage explanations. The code used in this paper can be found at: https://github.com/JacksonWuxs/UsableXAI_LLM.

      Given some information need, Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for candidate text relevance assessment, typically using a one-by-one pointwise (PW) strategy where each LLM call evaluates one candidate at a time. Meanwhile, it has been shown that LLM performance can be improved through self-consistency: prompting the LLM to do the same task multiple times (possibly in perturbed ways) and then aggregating the responses. To take advantage of self-consistency, we hypothesize that batched PW strategies, where multiple passages are judged in one LLM call, are better suited than one-by-one PW methods since a larger input context can induce more diverse LLM sampling across self-consistency calls. We first propose several candidate batching strategies to create prompt diversity across self-consistency calls through subset reselection and permutation. We then test our batched PW methods on relevance assessment and ranking tasks against one-by-one PW and listwise LLM ranking baselines with and without self-consistency, using three passage retrieval datasets and GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3, and Amazon Nova Pro. We find that batched PW methods outperform all baselines, and show that batching can greatly amplify the positive effects of self-consistency. For instance, on our legal search dataset, GPT-4o one-by-one PW ranking NDCG@10 improves only from 44.9% to 46.8% without self-consistency vs. with 15 self consistency calls, while batched PW ranking improves from 43.8% to 51.3%, respectively.

      Ambiguity remains a fundamental challenge in Natural Language Processing (NLP) due to the inherent complexity and flexibility of human language. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), addressing ambiguity has become even more critical due to their expanded capabilities and applications. In the context of Conversational Question Answering (CQA), this paper explores the definition, forms, and implications of ambiguity for language driven systems, particularly in the context of LLMs. We define key terms and concepts, categorize various disambiguation approaches enabled by LLMs, and provide a comparative analysis of their advantages and disadvantages. We also explore publicly available datasets for benchmarking ambiguity detection and resolution techniques and highlight their relevance for ongoing research. Finally, we identify open problems and future research directions, proposing areas for further investigation. By offering a comprehensive review of current research on ambiguities and disambiguation with LLMs, we aim to contribute to the development of more robust and reliable language systems.

      Large language models (LLMs) excel at rapid generation of text and multimodal content, yet they falter on transaction-style planning that demands ACID-like guarantees and real-time disruption recovery. We present Adaptive LLM Agent System (ALAS), a framework that tackles four fundamental LLM deficits: (i) absence of self-verification, (ii) context erosion, (iii) next-token myopia, and (iv) lack of persistent state. ALAS decomposes each plan into role-specialized agents, equips them with automatic state tracking, and coordinates them through a lightweight protocol. When disruptions arise, agents apply history-aware local compensation, avoiding costly global replanning and containing cascade effects. On real-world, large-scale job-shop scheduling benchmarks, ALAS sets new best results for static sequential planning and excels in dynamic reactive scenarios with unexpected disruptions. These gains show that principled modularization plus targeted compensation can unlock scalable and resilient planning with LLMs.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong potential in mathematical reasoning, yet their effectiveness is often limited by a shortage of high-quality queries. This limitation necessitates scaling up computational responses through self-generated data, yet current methods struggle due to spurious correlated data caused by ineffective exploration across all reasoning stages. To address such challenge, we introduce \textbf{MARGE}: Improving \textbf{Ma}th \textbf{R}easoning with \textbf{G}uided \textbf{E}xploration, a novel method to address this issue and enhance mathematical reasoning through hit-guided exploration. MARGE systematically explores intermediate reasoning states derived from self-generated solutions, enabling adequate exploration and improved credit assignment throughout the reasoning process. Through extensive experiments across multiple backbone models and benchmarks, we demonstrate that MARGE significantly improves reasoning capabilities without requiring external annotations or training additional value models. Notably, MARGE improves both single-shot accuracy and exploration diversity, mitigating a common trade-off in alignment methods. These results demonstrate MARGE's effectiveness in enhancing mathematical reasoning capabilities and unlocking the potential of scaling self-generated training data.

      Despite the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various fields, their potential to generate untruthful, biased and harmful responses poses significant risks, particularly in critical applications. This highlights the urgent need for systematic methods to detect and prevent such misbehavior. While existing approaches target specific issues such as harmful responses, this work introduces LLMScan, an innovative LLM monitoring technique based on causality analysis, offering a comprehensive solution. LLMScan systematically monitors the inner workings of an LLM through the lens of causal inference, operating on the premise that the LLM's `brain' behaves differently when misbehaving. By analyzing the causal contributions of the LLM's input tokens and transformer layers, LLMScan effectively detects misbehavior. Extensive experiments across various tasks and models reveal clear distinctions in the causal distributions between normal behavior and misbehavior, enabling the development of accurate, lightweight detectors for a variety of misbehavior detection tasks.

      The increasing context length of modern language models has created a need for evaluating their ability to retrieve and process information across extensive documents. While existing benchmarks test long-context capabilities, they often lack a structured way to systematically vary question complexity. We introduce KG-QAGen (Knowledge-Graph-based Question-Answer Generation), a framework that (1) extracts QA pairs at multiple complexity levels (2) by leveraging structured representations of financial agreements (3) along three key dimensions -- multi-hop retrieval, set operations, and answer plurality -- enabling fine-grained assessment of model performance across controlled difficulty levels. Using this framework, we construct a dataset of 20,139 QA pairs (the largest number among the long-context benchmarks) and open-source a part of it. We evaluate 13 proprietary and open-source LLMs and observe that even the best-performing models are struggling with set-based comparisons and multi-hop logical inference. Our analysis reveals systematic failure modes tied to semantic misinterpretation and inability to handle implicit relations.

      Large language models (LLMs) increasingly demonstrate signs of conceptual understanding, yet much of their internal knowledge remains latent, loosely structured, and difficult to access or evaluate. We propose self-questioning as a lightweight and scalable strategy to improve LLMs' understanding, particularly in domains where success depends on fine-grained semantic distinctions. To evaluate this approach, we introduce a challenging new benchmark of 1.3 million post-2015 computer science patent pairs, characterized by dense technical jargon and strategically complex writing. The benchmark centers on a pairwise differentiation task: can a model distinguish between closely related but substantively different inventions? We show that prompting LLMs to generate and answer their own questions - targeting the background knowledge required for the task - significantly improves performance. These self-generated questions and answers activate otherwise underutilized internal knowledge. Allowing LLMs to retrieve answers from external scientific texts further enhances performance, suggesting that model knowledge is compressed and lacks the full richness of the training data. We also find that chain-of-thought prompting and self-questioning converge, though self-questioning remains more effective for improving understanding of technical concepts. Notably, we uncover an asymmetry in prompting: smaller models often generate more fundamental, more open-ended, better-aligned questions for mid-sized models than large models with better understanding do, revealing a new strategy for cross-model collaboration. Altogether, our findings establish self-questioning as both a practical mechanism for automatically improving LLM comprehension, especially in domains with sparse and underrepresented knowledge, and a diagnostic probe of how internal and external knowledge are organized.

      The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the emergence of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) to perform complex tasks through collaboration. However, the intricate nature of MAS, including their architecture and agent interactions, raises significant concerns regarding intellectual property (IP) protection. In this paper, we introduce MASLEAK, a novel attack framework designed to extract sensitive information from MAS applications. MASLEAK targets a practical, black-box setting, where the adversary has no prior knowledge of the MAS architecture or agent configurations. The adversary can only interact with the MAS through its public API, submitting attack query $q$ and observing outputs from the final agent. Inspired by how computer worms propagate and infect vulnerable network hosts, MASLEAK carefully crafts adversarial query $q$ to elicit, propagate, and retain responses from each MAS agent that reveal a full set of proprietary components, including the number of agents, system topology, system prompts, task instructions, and tool usages. We construct the first synthetic dataset of MAS applications with 810 applications and also evaluate MASLEAK against real-world MAS applications, including Coze and CrewAI. MASLEAK achieves high accuracy in extracting MAS IP, with an average attack success rate of 87% for system prompts and task instructions, and 92% for system architecture in most cases. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings and the potential defenses.

      Interactive Fiction games (IF games) are where players interact through natural language commands. While recent advances in Artificial Intelligence agents have reignited interest in IF games as a domain for studying decision-making, existing approaches prioritize task-specific performance metrics over human-like comprehension of narrative context and gameplay logic. This work presents a cognitively inspired framework that guides Large Language Models (LLMs) to learn and play IF games systematically. Our proposed **L**earning to **P**lay **L**ike **H**umans (LPLH) framework integrates three key components: (1) structured map building to capture spatial and narrative relationships, (2) action learning to identify context-appropriate commands, and (3) feedback-driven experience analysis to refine decision-making over time. By aligning LLMs-based agents' behavior with narrative intent and commonsense constraints, LPLH moves beyond purely exploratory strategies to deliver more interpretable, human-like performance. Crucially, this approach draws on cognitive science principles to more closely simulate how human players read, interpret, and respond within narrative worlds. As a result, LPLH reframes the IF games challenge as a learning problem for LLMs-based agents, offering a new path toward robust, context-aware gameplay in complex text-based environments.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as promising tools for automated unit test generation. We introduce a hybrid framework called EvoGPT that integrates LLM-based test generation with evolutionary search techniques to create diverse, fault-revealing unit tests. Unit tests are initially generated with diverse temperature sampling to maximize behavioral and test suite diversity, followed by a generation-repair loop and coverage-guided assertion enhancement. The resulting test suites are evolved using genetic algorithms, guided by a fitness function prioritizing mutation score over traditional coverage metrics. This design emphasizes the primary objective of unit testing-fault detection. Evaluated on multiple open-source Java projects, EvoGPT achieves an average improvement of 10% in both code coverage and mutation score compared to LLMs and traditional search-based software testing baselines. These results demonstrate that combining LLM-driven diversity, targeted repair, and evolutionary optimization produces more effective and resilient test suites.

      Existing methods to enhance the reasoning capability of large language models predominantly rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by reinforcement learning (RL) on reasoning-specific data. These approaches critically depend on external supervisions--such as labeled reasoning traces, verified golden answers, or pre-trained reward models. In this work, we propose Entropy Minimized Policy Optimization (\ours), which makes an early attempt at fully unsupervised LLM reasoning incentivization. By continuously minimizing the predictive entropy of LLMs on unlabeled questions in a latent semantic space, \ours achieves competitive performance compared to supervised counterparts on both mathematical and free-form natural reasoning tasks. Specifically, without any supervised signals, \ours boosts the accuracy of Qwen2.5-Math-7B Base from 30.7\% to 48.1\% on mathematical benchmarks and improves the accuracy of Qwen2.5-7B Base from 32.1\% to 50.1\% on MMLU-Pro.

      Graph neural networks (GNNs) have advanced recommender systems by modeling interaction relationships. However, existing graph-based recommenders rely on sparse ID features and do not fully exploit textual information, resulting in low information density within representations. Furthermore, graph contrastive learning faces challenges. Random negative sampling can introduce false negative samples, while fixed temperature coefficients cannot adapt to the heterogeneity of different nodes. In addition, current efforts to enhance recommendations with large language models (LLMs) have not fully utilized their Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities to guide representation learning. To address these limitations, we introduces LGHRec (LLM-CoT Enhanced Graph Neural Recommendation with Harmonized Group Policy Optimization). This framework leverages the CoT reasoning ability of LLMs to generate semantic IDs, enriching reasoning processes and improving information density and semantic quality of representations. Moreover, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm, Harmonized Group Policy Optimization (HGPO), to optimize negative sampling strategies and temperature coefficients in contrastive learning. This approach enhances long-tail recommendation performance and ensures optimization consistency across different groups. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that LGHRec improves representation quality through semantic IDs generated by LLM's CoT reasoning and effectively boosts contrastive learning with HGPO. Our method outperforms several baseline models. The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM-Rec.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Large language models (LLMs) often produce errors, including factual inaccuracies, biases, and reasoning failures, collectively referred to as "hallucinations". Recent studies have demonstrated that LLMs' internal states encode information regarding the truthfulness of their outputs, and that this information can be utilized to detect errors. In this work, we show that the internal representations of LLMs encode much more information about truthfulness than previously recognized. We first discover that the truthfulness information is concentrated in specific tokens, and leveraging this property significantly enhances error detection performance. Yet, we show that such error detectors fail to generalize across datasets, implying that -- contrary to prior claims -- truthfulness encoding is not universal but rather multifaceted. Next, we show that internal representations can also be used for predicting the types of errors the model is likely to make, facilitating the development of tailored mitigation strategies. Lastly, we reveal a discrepancy between LLMs' internal encoding and external behavior: they may encode the correct answer, yet consistently generate an incorrect one. Taken together, these insights deepen our understanding of LLM errors from the model's internal perspective, which can guide future research on enhancing error analysis and mitigation.

To address this, we explore crowd-based strategies for mitigating bias through response aggregation. We first demonstrate that simply averaging responses from multiple LLMs, intended to leverage the "wisdom of the crowd", can exacerbate existing biases due to the limited diversity within LLM crowds. In contrast, we show that locally weighted aggregation methods more effectively leverage the wisdom of the LLM crowd, achieving both bias mitigation and improved accuracy. Finally, recognizing the complementary strengths of LLMs (accuracy) and humans (diversity), we demonstrate that hybrid crowds containing both significantly enhance performance and further reduce biases across ethnic and gender-related contexts.

      Claim verification is essential in combating misinformation, and large language models (LLMs) have recently emerged in this area as powerful tools for assessing the veracity of claims using external knowledge. Existing LLM-based methods for claim verification typically adopt a Decompose-Then-Verify paradigm, which involves decomposing complex claims into several independent sub-claims and verifying each sub-claim separately. However, this paradigm often introduces errors during the claim decomposition process. To mitigate these errors, we propose to develop the Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-Verify paradigm, which leverages LLM reasoning methods to generate CoT-verification paths for the original complex claim without requiring decompositions into sub-claims and separate verification stages. The CoT-Verify paradigm allows us to propose a natural fine-tuning method called Reasoning-CV to enhance the verification capabilities in LLMs. Reasoning-CV includes a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage and a self-improvement direct preference optimization (DPO) stage. Utilizing only an 8B pre-trained LLM, Reasoning-CV demonstrates superior knowledge-assisted claim verification performances compared to existing Decompose-Then-Verify methods, as well as powerful black-box LLMs such as GPT-4o+CoT and o1-preview.

Existing benchmarks often require extensive manual effort to create static datasets, rely on indirect or insufficiently challenging tasks, depend on non-scalable ground truth, or neglect critical low-level security evaluations, particularly memory-safety issues. In this work, we introduce OSS-Bench, a benchmark generator that automatically constructs large-scale, live evaluation tasks from real-world open-source software. OSS-Bench replaces functions with LLM-generated code and evaluates them using three natural metrics: compilability, functional correctness, and memory safety, leveraging robust signals like compilation failures, test-suite violations, and sanitizer alerts as ground truth. In our evaluation, the benchmark, instantiated as OSS-Bench(php) and OSS-Bench(sql), profiles 17 diverse LLMs, revealing insights such as intra-family behavioral patterns and inconsistencies between model size and performance. Our results demonstrate that OSS-Bench mitigates overfitting by leveraging the evolving complexity of OSS and highlights LLMs' limited understanding of low-level code security via extended fuzzing experiments. Overall, OSS-Bench offers a practical and scalable framework for benchmarking the real-world coding capabilities of LLMs.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have become essential for offensive language detection, yet their ability to handle annotation disagreement remains underexplored. Disagreement samples, which arise from subjective interpretations, pose a unique challenge due to their ambiguous nature. Understanding how LLMs process these cases, particularly their confidence levels, can offer insight into their alignment with human annotators. This study systematically evaluates the performance of multiple LLMs in detecting offensive language at varying levels of annotation agreement. We analyze binary classification accuracy, examine the relationship between model confidence and human disagreement, and explore how disagreement samples influence model decision-making during few-shot learning and instruction fine-tuning. Our findings reveal that LLMs struggle with low-agreement samples, often exhibiting overconfidence in these ambiguous cases. However, utilizing disagreement samples in training improves both detection accuracy and model alignment with human judgment. These insights provide a foundation for enhancing LLM-based offensive language detection in real-world moderation tasks.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities across various tasks, yet guiding them to follow desired behaviours during inference remains a significant challenge. Activation steering offers a promising method to control the generation process of LLMs by modifying their internal activations. However, existing methods commonly intervene in the model's behaviour using steering vectors generated by the model itself, which constrains their effectiveness to that specific model and excludes the possibility of leveraging powerful external expert models for steering. To address these limitations, we propose ExpertSteer, a novel approach that leverages arbitrary specialized expert models to generate steering vectors, enabling intervention in any LLMs. ExpertSteer transfers the knowledge from an expert model to a target LLM through a cohesive four-step process: first aligning representation dimensions with auto-encoders to enable cross-model transfer, then identifying intervention layer pairs based on mutual information analysis, next generating steering vectors from the expert model using Recursive Feature Machines, and finally applying these vectors on the identified layers during inference to selectively guide the target LLM without updating model parameters. We conduct comprehensive experiments using three LLMs on 15 popular benchmarks across four distinct domains. Experiments demonstrate that ExpertSteer significantly outperforms established baselines across diverse tasks at minimal cost.

      LLMs have emerged as powerful evaluators in the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm, offering significant efficiency and flexibility compared to human judgments. However, previous methods primarily rely on single-point evaluations, overlooking the inherent diversity and uncertainty in human evaluations. This approach leads to information loss and decreases the reliability of evaluations. To address this limitation, we propose a novel training framework that explicitly aligns the LLM-generated judgment distribution with empirical human distributions. Specifically, we propose a distributional alignment objective based on KL divergence, combined with an auxiliary cross-entropy regularization to stabilize the training process. Furthermore, considering that empirical distributions may derive from limited human annotations, we incorporate adversarial training to enhance model robustness against distribution perturbations. Extensive experiments across various LLM backbones and evaluation tasks demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing closed-source LLMs and conventional single-point alignment methods, with improved alignment quality, evaluation accuracy, and robustness.

      Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex tasks thanks to advances in reasoning abilities. However, existing methods overlook the trade-off between reasoning effectiveness and computational efficiency, often encouraging unnecessarily long reasoning chains and wasting tokens. To address this, we propose Learning to Think (L2T), an information-theoretic reinforcement fine-tuning framework for LLMs to make the models achieve optimal reasoning with fewer tokens. Specifically, L2T treats each query-response interaction as a hierarchical session of multiple episodes and proposes a universal dense process reward, i.e., quantifies the episode-wise information gain in parameters, requiring no extra annotations or task-specific evaluators. We propose a method to quickly estimate this reward based on PAC-Bayes bounds and the Fisher information matrix. Theoretical analyses show that it significantly reduces computational complexity with high estimation accuracy. By immediately rewarding each episode's contribution and penalizing excessive updates, L2T optimizes the model via reinforcement learning to maximize the use of each episode and achieve effective updates. Empirical results on various reasoning benchmarks and base models demonstrate the advantage of L2T across different tasks, boosting both reasoning effectiveness and efficiency.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen widespread applications across various domains due to their growing ability to process diverse types of input data, including text, audio, image and video. While LLMs have demonstrated outstanding performance in understanding and generating contexts for different scenarios, they are vulnerable to prompt-based attacks, which are mostly via text input. In this paper, we introduce the first voice-based jailbreak attack against multimodal LLMs, termed as Flanking Attack, which can process different types of input simultaneously towards the multimodal LLMs. Our work is motivated by recent advancements in monolingual voice-driven large language models, which have introduced new attack surfaces beyond traditional text-based vulnerabilities for LLMs. To investigate these risks, we examine the state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs, which can be accessed via different types of inputs such as audio input, focusing on how adversarial prompts can bypass its defense mechanisms. We propose a novel strategy, in which the disallowed prompt is flanked by benign, narrative-driven prompts. It is integrated in the Flanking Attack which attempts to humanizes the interaction context and execute the attack through a fictional setting. Further, to better evaluate the attack performance, we present a semi-automated self-assessment framework for policy violation detection. We demonstrate that Flanking Attack is capable of manipulating state-of-the-art LLMs into generating misaligned and forbidden outputs, which achieves an average attack success rate ranging from 0.67 to 0.93 across seven forbidden scenarios.

      Evaluating machine translation (MT) for low-resource languages poses a persistent challenge, primarily due to the limited availability of high quality reference translations. This issue is further exacerbated in languages with multiple dialects, where linguistic diversity and data scarcity hinder robust evaluation. Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising solution through reference-free evaluation techniques; however, their effectiveness diminishes in the absence of dialect-specific context and tailored guidance. In this work, we propose a comprehensive framework that enhances LLM-based MT evaluation using a dialect guided approach. We extend the ONUBAD dataset by incorporating Sylheti-English sentence pairs, corresponding machine translations, and Direct Assessment (DA) scores annotated by native speakers. To address the vocabulary gap, we augment the tokenizer vocabulary with dialect-specific terms. We further introduce a regression head to enable scalar score prediction and design a dialect-guided (DG) prompting strategy. Our evaluation across multiple LLMs shows that the proposed pipeline consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving the highest gain of +0.1083 in Spearman correlation, along with improvements across other evaluation settings.

      Large Language Models (LLMs)-based hybrid retrieval uses LLMs to encode queries and documents into low-dimensional dense or high-dimensional sparse vectors. It retrieves documents relevant to search queries based on vector similarities. Documents are pre-encoded offline, while queries arrive in real-time, necessitating an efficient online query encoder. Although LLMs significantly enhance retrieval capabilities, serving deeply parameterized LLMs slows down query inference throughput and increases demands for online deployment resources. In this paper, we propose LightRetriever, a novel LLM-based hybrid retriever with extremely lightweight query encoders. Our method retains a full-sized LLM for document encoding, but reduces the workload of query encoding to no more than an embedding lookup. Compared to serving a full-sized LLM on an H800 GPU, our approach achieves over a 1000x speedup for query inference with GPU acceleration, and even a 20x speedup without GPU. Experiments on large-scale retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that our method generalizes well across diverse retrieval tasks, retaining an average of 95% full-sized performance.

      Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has outpaced the development of effective evaluation methods. Traditional benchmarks rely on task-specific metrics and static datasets, which often suffer from fairness issues, limited scalability, and contamination risks. In this paper, we introduce Teach2Eval, an indirect evaluation framework inspired by the Feynman Technique. Instead of directly testing LLMs on predefined tasks, our method evaluates a model's multiple abilities to teach weaker student models to perform tasks effectively. By converting open-ended tasks into standardized multiple-choice questions (MCQs) through teacher-generated feedback, Teach2Eval enables scalable, automated, and multi-dimensional assessment. Our approach not only avoids data leakage and memorization but also captures a broad range of cognitive abilities that are orthogonal to current benchmarks. Experimental results across 26 leading LLMs show strong alignment with existing human and model-based dynamic rankings, while offering additional interpretability for training guidance.

      Identifying subtle technical errors within complex scientific and technical documents, especially those requiring multimodal interpretation (e.g., formulas in images), presents a significant hurdle for Large Language Models (LLMs) whose inherent error-correction tendencies can mask inaccuracies. This exploratory proof-of-concept (PoC) study investigates structured LLM context conditioning, informed by Persistent Workflow Prompting (PWP) principles, as a methodological strategy to modulate this LLM behavior at inference time. The approach is designed to enhance the reliability of readily available, general-purpose LLMs (specifically Gemini 2.5 Pro and ChatGPT Plus o3) for precise validation tasks, crucially relying only on their standard chat interfaces without API access or model modifications. To explore this methodology, we focused on validating chemical formulas within a single, complex test paper with known textual and image-based errors. Several prompting strategies were evaluated: while basic prompts proved unreliable, an approach adapting PWP structures to rigorously condition the LLM's analytical mindset appeared to improve textual error identification with both models. Notably, this method also guided Gemini 2.5 Pro to repeatedly identify a subtle image-based formula error previously overlooked during manual review, a task where ChatGPT Plus o3 failed in our tests. These preliminary findings highlight specific LLM operational modes that impede detail-oriented validation and suggest that PWP-informed context conditioning offers a promising and highly accessible technique for developing more robust LLM-driven analytical workflows, particularly for tasks requiring meticulous error detection in scientific and technical documents. Extensive validation beyond this limited PoC is necessary to ascertain broader applicability.

      Personalized product search aims to retrieve and rank items that match users' preferences and search intent. Despite their effectiveness, existing approaches typically assume that users' query fully captures their real motivation. However, our analysis of a real-world e-commerce platform reveals that users often engage in relevant consultations before searching, indicating they refine intents through consultations based on motivation and need. The implied motivation in consultations is a key enhancing factor for personalized search. This unexplored area comes with new challenges including aligning contextual motivations with concise queries, bridging the category-text gap, and filtering noise within sequence history. To address these, we propose a Motivation-Aware Personalized Search (MAPS) method. It embeds queries and consultations into a unified semantic space via LLMs, utilizes a Mixture of Attention Experts (MoAE) to prioritize critical semantics, and introduces dual alignment: (1) contrastive learning aligns consultations, reviews, and product features; (2) bidirectional attention integrates motivation-aware embeddings with user preferences. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic data show MAPS outperforms existing methods in both retrieval and ranking tasks.

Existing efforts to study sensitive and PII data memorization and develop mitigation strategies are hampered by the absence of comprehensive, realistic, and ethically sourced datasets reflecting the diversity of sensitive information found on the web. We introduce PANORAMA - Profile-based Assemblage for Naturalistic Online Representation and Attribute Memorization Analysis, a large-scale synthetic corpus of 384,789 samples derived from 9,674 synthetic profiles designed to closely emulate the distribution, variety, and context of PII and sensitive data as it naturally occurs in online environments. Our data generation pipeline begins with the construction of internally consistent, multi-attribute human profiles using constrained selection to reflect real-world demographics such as education, health attributes, financial status, etc. Using a combination of zero-shot prompting and OpenAI o3-mini, we generate diverse content types - including wiki-style articles, social media posts, forum discussions, online reviews, comments, and marketplace listings - each embedding realistic, contextually appropriate PII and other sensitive information. We validate the utility of PANORAMA by fine-tuning the Mistral-7B model on 1x, 5x, 10x, and 25x data replication rates with a subset of data and measure PII memorization rates - revealing not only consistent increases with repetition but also variation across content types, highlighting PANORAMA's ability to model how memorization risks differ by context.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning and generalization capabilities in video understanding; however, their application in video editing remains largely underexplored. This paper presents the first systematic study of LLMs in the context of video editing. To bridge the gap between visual information and language-based reasoning, we introduce L-Storyboard, an intermediate representation that transforms discrete video shots into structured language descriptions suitable for LLM processing. We categorize video editing tasks into Convergent Tasks and Divergent Tasks, focusing on three core tasks: Shot Attributes Classification, Next Shot Selection, and Shot Sequence Ordering. To address the inherent instability of divergent task outputs, we propose the StoryFlow strategy, which converts the divergent multi-path reasoning process into a convergent selection mechanism, effectively enhancing task accuracy and logical coherence. Experimental results demonstrate that L-Storyboard facilitates a more robust mapping between visual information and language descriptions, significantly improving the interpretability and privacy protection of video editing tasks. Furthermore, StoryFlow enhances the logical consistency and output stability in Shot Sequence Ordering, underscoring the substantial potential of LLMs in intelligent video editing.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for applications in healthcare, reaching the performance of domain experts on tasks such as question answering and document summarisation. Despite their success on these tasks, it is unclear how well LLMs perform on tasks that are traditionally pursued in the biomedical domain, such as structured information extraction. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we systematically benchmark LLM performance in Medical Classification and Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks. We aim to disentangle the contribution of different factors to the performance, particularly the impact of LLMs' task knowledge and reasoning capabilities, their (parametric) domain knowledge, and addition of external knowledge. To this end, we evaluate various open LLMs - including BioMistral and Llama-2 models - on a diverse set of biomedical datasets, using standard prompting, Chain of-Thought (CoT) and Self Consistency based reasoning as well as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with PubMed and Wikipedia corpora. Counter intuitively, our results reveal that standard prompting consistently outperforms more complex techniques across both tasks, laying bare the limitations in the current application of CoT, self-consistency and RAG in the biomedical domain. Our findings suggest that advanced prompting methods developed for knowledge- or reasoning-intensive tasks, such as CoT or RAG, are not easily portable to biomedical tasks where precise structured outputs are required. This highlights the need for more effective integration of external knowledge and reasoning mechanisms in LLMs to enhance their performance in real-world biomedical applications.

      Preference alignment methods are increasingly critical for steering large language models (LLMs) to generate outputs consistent with human values. While recent approaches often rely on synthetic data generated by LLMs for scalability and cost-efficiency reasons, this reliance can introduce distribution shifts that undermine the nuanced representation of human preferences needed for desirable outputs. In this paper, we propose a novel distribution-aware optimization framework that improves preference alignment despite such shifts. Our approach first leverages well-learned classifiers to assign a calibration value to each training sample, quantifying its alignment with the target human-preferred distribution. These values are then incorporated into a robust optimization objective that minimizes the worst-case loss over regions of the data space most relevant to human preferences. By explicitly focusing optimization on the target distribution, our approach mitigates the impact of distributional mismatch and improves the generation of responses that better reflect intended values.

      High-quality reward models are crucial for unlocking the reasoning potential of large language models (LLMs), with best-of-N voting demonstrating significant performance gains. However, current reward models, which typically operate on the textual output of LLMs, are computationally expensive and parameter-heavy, limiting their real-world applications. We introduce the Efficient Linear Hidden State Reward (ELHSR) model - a novel, highly parameter-efficient approach that leverages the rich information embedded in LLM hidden states to address these issues. ELHSR systematically outperform baselines with less than 0.005% of the parameters of baselines, requiring only a few samples for training. ELHSR also achieves orders-of-magnitude efficiency improvement with significantly less time and fewer FLOPs per sample than baseline reward models. Moreover, ELHSR exhibits robust performance even when trained only on logits, extending its applicability to some closed-source LLMs. In addition, ELHSR can also be combined with traditional reward models to achieve additional performance gains.

While these models serve as a promising alternative to human annotators, their reliability in multilingual evaluation remains uncertain. To bridge this gap, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of multilingual LLM-as-a-Judge. Specifically, we evaluate five models from different model families across five diverse tasks involving 25 languages. Our findings reveal that LLMs struggle to achieve consistent judgment results across languages, with an average Fleiss' Kappa of approximately 0.3, and some models performing even worse. To investigate the cause of inconsistency, we analyze various influencing factors. We observe that consistency varies significantly across languages, with particularly poor performance in low-resource languages. Additionally, we find that neither training on multilingual data nor increasing model scale directly improves judgment consistency. These findings suggest that LLMs are not yet reliable for evaluating multilingual predictions. We finally propose an ensemble strategy which improves the consistency of the multilingual judge in real-world applications.

      Assessing the programming capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for their effective use in software engineering. Current evaluations, however, predominantly measure the accuracy of generated code on static benchmarks, neglecting the critical aspect of model robustness during programming tasks. While adversarial attacks offer insights on model robustness, their effectiveness is limited and evaluation could be constrained. Current adversarial attack methods for robustness evaluation yield inconsistent results, struggling to provide a unified evaluation across different LLMs. We introduce EVALOOP, a novel assessment framework that evaluate the robustness from a self-consistency perspective, i.e., leveraging the natural duality inherent in popular software engineering tasks, e.g., code generation and code summarization. EVALOOP initiates a self-contained feedback loop: an LLM generates output (e.g., code) from an input (e.g., natural language specification), and then use the generated output as the input to produce a new output (e.g., summarizes that code into a new specification). EVALOOP repeats the process to assess the effectiveness of EVALOOP in each loop. This cyclical strategy intrinsically evaluates robustness without rely on any external attack setups, providing a unified metric to evaluate LLMs' robustness in programming. We evaluate 16 prominent LLMs (e.g., GPT-4.1, O4-mini) on EVALOOP and found that EVALOOP typically induces a 5.01%-19.31% absolute drop in pass@1 performance within ten loops. Intriguingly, robustness does not always align with initial performance (i.e., one-time query); for instance, GPT-3.5-Turbo, despite superior initial code generation compared to DeepSeek-V2, demonstrated lower robustness over repeated evaluation loop.

      Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance on knowledge-intensive tasks, yet they often struggle with multi-step reasoning due to the unstructured nature of retrieved context. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods provide external information, the lack of explicit organization among retrieved passages limits their effectiveness, leading to brittle reasoning pathways. Recent interpretability studies highlighting the importance of structured intermediate reasoning further align with this perspective. We propose Retrieval-And-Structuring (RAS), a framework that dynamically constructs query-specific knowledge graphs through iterative retrieval and structured knowledge building. RAS interleaves targeted retrieval planning with incremental graph construction, enabling models to assemble and reason over evolving knowledge structures tailored to each query. On seven knowledge-intensive benchmarks, RAS consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to 6.4% and 7.0% gains with open-source and proprietary LLMs, respectively. Our results demonstrate that dynamic, query-specific knowledge structuring offers a robust path to improving reasoning accuracy and robustness in language model generation.

BRANCH factorizes a joint probability distribution of personal information as random variables. The probability of each factor in a population is estimated separately using a Bayesian network and combined to compute the final k-value. Our experiments show that this method successfully estimates the k-value 73% of the time, a 13% increase compared to o3-mini with chain-of-thought reasoning. We also find that LLM uncertainty is a good indicator for accuracy, as high-variance predictions are 37.47% less accurate on average.

      Assessing the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to plan and reason within the constraints of interactive environments is crucial for developing capable AI agents. We introduce $\textbf{LLM-BabyBench}$, a new benchmark suite designed specifically for this purpose. Built upon a textual adaptation of the procedurally generated BabyAI grid world, this suite evaluates LLMs on three fundamental aspects of grounded intelligence: (1) predicting the consequences of actions on the environment state ($\textbf{Predict}$ task), (2) generating sequences of low-level actions to achieve specified objectives ($\textbf{Plan}$ task), and (3) decomposing high-level instructions into coherent subgoal sequences ($\textbf{Decompose}$ task). We detail the methodology for generating the three corresponding datasets ($\texttt{LLM-BabyBench-Predict}$, $\texttt{-Plan}$, $\texttt{-Decompose}$) by extracting structured information from an expert agent operating within the text-based environment. Furthermore, we provide a standardized evaluation harness and metrics, including environment interaction for validating generated plans, to facilitate reproducible assessment of diverse LLMs. Initial baseline results highlight the challenges posed by these grounded reasoning tasks. The benchmark suite, datasets, data generation code, and evaluation code are made publicly available ($\href{https://github.com/choukrani/llm-babybench}{\text{GitHub}}$, $\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/salem-mbzuai/LLM-BabyBench}{\text{HuggingFace}}$).

      This paper investigates code LLMs' capability of static analysis during code intelligence tasks such as code summarization and generation. Code LLMs are now household names for their abilities to do some programming tasks that have heretofore required people. The process that people follow to do programming tasks has long been understood to require static analysis. For example, human programmers navigate the call graph of large programs to comprehend the different parts of those programs. Education in programming includes static analysis under the assumption that better static analysis skills beget better programming. Yet while popular culture is replete with anthropomorphic references such as LLM "reasoning", in fact code LLMs could exhibit a wholly alien thought process to humans. This paper studies the specific question of static analysis by code LLMs. We use three different static analysis tasks (callgraph generation, AST generation, and dataflow generation) and three different code intelligence tasks (code generation, summarization, and translation) with two different open-source models (Gemini and GPT-4o) and closed-source models (CodeLlaMA and Jam) as our experiments. We found that LLMs show poor performance on static analysis tasks and that pretraining on the static analysis tasks does not generalize to better performance on the code intelligence tasks.

      Modern organizations are persistently targeted by phishing emails. Despite advances in detection systems and widespread employee training, attackers continue to innovate, posing ongoing threats. Two emerging vectors stand out in the current landscape: QR-code baits and LLM-enabled pretexting. Yet, little is known about the effectiveness of current defenses against these attacks, particularly when it comes to real-world impact on employees. This gap leaves uncertainty around to what extent related countermeasures are justified or needed. Our work addresses this issue. We conduct three phishing simulations across organizations of varying sizes -- from small-medium businesses to a multinational enterprise. In total, we send over 71k emails targeting employees, including: a "traditional" phishing email with a click-through button; a nearly-identical "quishing" email with a QR code instead; and a phishing email written with the assistance of an LLM and open-source intelligence. Our results show that quishing emails have the same effectiveness as traditional phishing emails at luring users to the landing webpage -- which is worrying, given that quishing emails are much harder to identify even by operational detectors. We also find that LLMs can be very good "social engineers": in one company, over 30% of the emails opened led to visiting the landing webpage -- a rate exceeding some prior benchmarks. Finally, we complement our study by conducting a survey across the organizations' employees, measuring their "perceived" phishing awareness. Our findings suggest a correlation between higher self-reported awareness and organizational resilience to phishing attempts.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) push the bound-aries in natural language processing and generative AI, driving progress across various aspects of modern society. Unfortunately, the pervasive issue of bias in LLMs responses (i.e., predictions) poses a significant and open challenge, hindering their application in tasks involving ethical sensitivity and responsible decision-making. In this work, we propose a straightforward, user-friendly and practical method to mitigate such biases, enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of LLMs. Our method creates multiple variations of a given sentence by modifying specific attributes and evaluates the corresponding prediction behavior compared to the original, unaltered, prediction/sentence. The idea behind this process is that critical ethical predictions often exhibit notable inconsistencies, indicating the presence of bias. Unlike previous approaches, our method relies solely on forward passes (i.e., testing-time adversaries), eliminating the need for training, fine-tuning, or prior knowledge of the training data distribution. Through extensive experiments on the popular Llama family, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in improving various fairness metrics, focusing on the reduction of disparities in how the model treats individuals from different racial groups. Specifically, using standard metrics, we improve the fairness in Llama3 in up to 27 percentage points. Overall, our approach significantly enhances fairness, equity, and reliability in LLM-generated results without parameter tuning or training data modifications, confirming its effectiveness in practical scenarios. We believe our work establishes an important step toward enabling the use of LLMs in tasks that require ethical considerations and responsible decision-making.

      While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable general performance, enabling smaller models to achieve capabilities comparable to their larger counterparts remains a critical challenge. For humans, iterative refinement of problem analysis and responses is a common strategy to enhance answer quality. However, we observe that existing LLMs exhibit limited ability to refine their outputs for quality improvement. In this paper, we first investigate mechanisms to unlock and progressively enhance self-refinement ability in smaller models within an iterative preference optimization framework, aiming to bridge the performance gap with larger models. To this end, we propose EVOLVE, a novel post-training and inference framework that iteratively integrates preference training with self-refinement-driven data collection. During training, EVOLVE strengthens the model's direct question-answering ability while simultaneously unlocking its self-refinement potential. At inference, the framework leverages this capability to generate progressively refined responses, which are filtered to construct datasets for subsequent rounds of preference training. Experiments demonstrate EVOLVE's exceptional performance: when applied to Llama-3.1-8B base model and under the self-refinement setting, it surpasses state-of-the-art models including Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct and GPT-4o, achieving a 62.3% length-controlled win rate and 63.3% raw win rate on AlpacaEval 2, along with a 50.3% win rate on Arena-Hard. Furthermore, EVOLVE consistently enhances performance on mathematical reasoning tasks like GSM8K and MATH.

      Multiple previous studies have reported suboptimal performance of LLMs in biomedical text mining. By analyzing failure patterns in these evaluations, we identified three primary challenges for LLMs in biomedical corpora: (1) LLMs fail to learn implicit dataset-specific nuances from supervised data, (2) The common formatting requirements of discriminative tasks limit the reasoning capabilities of LLMs particularly for LLMs that lack test-time compute, and (3) LLMs struggle to adhere to annotation guidelines and match exact schemas, which hinders their ability to understand detailed annotation requirements which is essential in biomedical annotation workflow. We experimented with prompt engineering techniques targeted to the above issues, and developed a pipeline that dynamically extracts instructions from annotation guidelines. Our results show that frontier LLMs can approach or surpass the performance of SOTA BERT-based models with minimal reliance on manually annotated data and without fine-tuning. Furthermore, we performed model distillation on a closed-source LLM, demonstrating that a BERT model trained exclusively on synthetic data annotated by LLMs can also achieve a practical performance. Based on these findings, we explored the feasibility of partially replacing manual annotation with LLMs in production scenarios for biomedical text mining.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across various tasks but remain vulnerable to meticulously crafted jailbreak attacks. In this paper, we identify a critical safety gap: while LLMs are adept at detecting jailbreak prompts, they often produce unsafe responses when directly processing these inputs. Inspired by this insight, we propose SAGE (Self-Aware Guard Enhancement), a training-free defense strategy designed to align LLMs' strong safety discrimination performance with their relatively weaker safety generation ability. SAGE consists of two core components: a Discriminative Analysis Module and a Discriminative Response Module, enhancing resilience against sophisticated jailbreak attempts through flexible safety discrimination instructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate SAGE's effectiveness and robustness across various open-source and closed-source LLMs of different sizes and architectures, achieving an average 99% defense success rate against numerous complex and covert jailbreak methods while maintaining helpfulness on general benchmarks. We further conduct mechanistic interpretability analysis through hidden states and attention distributions, revealing the underlying mechanisms of this detection-generation discrepancy. Our work thus contributes to developing future LLMs with coherent safety awareness and generation behavior. Our code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/NJUNLP/SAGE.

Born out of the tight feedback-loop demands building the Comet Opik prompt-optimization SDK, where waiting on heavyweight benchmarks breaks developer flow. TQB++ couples a 52-item English gold set (less than 20 kB) with a tiny synthetic-data generator pypi package built on provider-agnostic LiteLLM. The generator lets practitioners mint their own tiny packs in any language, domain, or difficulty, while ten ready-made packs already cover Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Turkish. Every dataset ships with Croissant metadata and plug-and-play files for OpenAI-Evals, LangChain, and standard CI tools, so teams can drop deterministic micro-benchmarks directly into pull-request gates, prompt-engineering loops, and production dashboards without touching GPU budgets. A complete TQB++ run adds only a few seconds to pipeline latency yet reliably flags prompt-template errors, tokenizer drift, and fine-tuning side-effects long before full-scale suites like MMLU or BIG-Bench would finish configuring.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across numerous tasks, yet principled explanations for their underlying mechanisms and several phenomena, such as scaling laws, hallucinations, and related behaviors, remain elusive. In this work, we revisit the classical relationship between compression and prediction, grounded in Kolmogorov complexity and Shannon information theory, to provide deeper insights into LLM behaviors. By leveraging the Kolmogorov Structure Function and interpreting LLM compression as a two-part coding process, we offer a detailed view of how LLMs acquire and store information across increasing model and data scales -- from pervasive syntactic patterns to progressively rarer knowledge elements. Motivated by this theoretical perspective and natural assumptions inspired by Heap's and Zipf's laws, we introduce a simplified yet representative hierarchical data-generation framework called the Syntax-Knowledge model. Under the Bayesian setting, we show that prediction and compression within this model naturally lead to diverse learning and scaling behaviors of LLMs. In particular, our theoretical analysis offers intuitive and principled explanations for both data and model scaling laws, the dynamics of knowledge acquisition during training and fine-tuning, factual knowledge hallucinations in LLMs. The experimental results validate our theoretical predictions.

      Although LLMs perform well in general tasks, domain-specific applications suffer from hallucinations and accuracy limitations. CPT approaches encounter two key issues: (1) domain-biased data degrades general language skills, and (2) improper corpus-mixture ratios limit effective adaptation. To address these, we propose a novel framework, Mixture of Losses (MoL), which decouples optimization objectives for domain-specific and general corpora. Specifically, cross-entropy (CE) loss is applied to domain data to ensure knowledge acquisition, while Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence aligns general-corpus training with the base model's foundational capabilities. This dual-loss architecture preserves universal skills while enhancing domain expertise, avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Empirically, we validate that a 1:1 domain-to-general corpus ratio optimally balances training and overfitting without the need for extensive tuning or resource-intensive experiments. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate significant performance gains compared to traditional CPT approaches, which often suffer from degradation in general language capabilities; our model achieves 27.9% higher accuracy on the Math-500 benchmark in the non-think reasoning mode, and an impressive 83.3% improvement on the challenging AIME25 subset in the think mode, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach.

      Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential as general-purpose AI assistants across various domains. To fully leverage this potential in specific applications, many companies provide fine-tuning API services, enabling users to upload their own data for LLM customization. However, fine-tuning services introduce a new safety threat: user-uploaded data, whether harmful or benign, can break the model's alignment, leading to unsafe outputs. Moreover, existing defense methods struggle to address the diversity of fine-tuning datasets (e.g., varying sizes, tasks), often sacrificing utility for safety or vice versa. To address this issue, we propose Safe Delta, a safety-aware post-training defense method that adjusts the delta parameters (i.e., the parameter change before and after fine-tuning). Specifically, Safe Delta estimates the safety degradation, selects delta parameters to maximize utility while limiting overall safety loss, and applies a safety compensation vector to mitigate residual safety loss. Through extensive experiments on four diverse datasets with varying settings, our approach consistently preserves safety while ensuring that the utility gain from benign datasets remains unaffected.

      Evaluating the step-by-step reliability of large language model (LLM) reasoning, such as Chain-of-Thought, remains challenging due to the difficulty and cost of obtaining high-quality step-level supervision. In this paper, we introduce Self-Play Critic (SPC), a novel approach where a critic model evolves its ability to assess reasoning steps through adversarial self-play games, eliminating the need for manual step-level annotation. SPC involves fine-tuning two copies of a base model to play two roles, namely a "sneaky generator" that deliberately produces erroneous steps designed to be difficult to detect, and a "critic" that analyzes the correctness of reasoning steps. These two models engage in an adversarial game in which the generator aims to fool the critic, while the critic model seeks to identify the generator's errors. Using reinforcement learning based on the game outcomes, the models iteratively improve; the winner of each confrontation receives a positive reward and the loser receives a negative reward, driving continuous self-evolution. Experiments on three reasoning process benchmarks (ProcessBench, PRM800K, DeltaBench) demonstrate that our SPC progressively enhances its error detection capabilities (e.g., accuracy increases from 70.8% to 77.7% on ProcessBench) and surpasses strong baselines, including distilled R1 model. Furthermore, SPC can guide the test-time search of diverse LLMs and significantly improve their mathematical reasoning performance on MATH500 and AIME2024, surpassing those guided by state-of-the-art process reward models.

      As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in multi-agent systems, questions of fairness should extend beyond resource distribution and procedural design to include the fairness of how agents communicate. Drawing from organizational psychology, we introduce a novel framework for evaluating Interactional fairness encompassing Interpersonal fairness (IF) and Informational fairness (InfF) in LLM-based multi-agent systems (LLM-MAS). We extend the theoretical grounding of Interactional Fairness to non-sentient agents, reframing fairness as a socially interpretable signal rather than a subjective experience. We then adapt established tools from organizational justice research, including Colquitt's Organizational Justice Scale and the Critical Incident Technique, to measure fairness as a behavioral property of agent interaction. We validate our framework through a pilot study using controlled simulations of a resource negotiation task. We systematically manipulate tone, explanation quality, outcome inequality, and task framing (collaborative vs. competitive) to assess how IF influences agent behavior. Results show that tone and justification quality significantly affect acceptance decisions even when objective outcomes are held constant. In addition, the influence of IF vs. InfF varies with context. This work lays the foundation for fairness auditing and norm-sensitive alignment in LLM-MAS.

      Considering the inherent limitations of parametric knowledge in large language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is widely employed to expand their knowledge scope. Since RAG has shown promise in knowledge-intensive tasks like open-domain question answering, its broader application to complex tasks and intelligent assistants has further advanced its utility. Despite this progress, the underlying knowledge utilization mechanisms of LLM-based RAG remain underexplored. In this paper, we present a systematic investigation of the intrinsic mechanisms by which LLMs integrate internal (parametric) and external (retrieved) knowledge in RAG scenarios. Specially, we employ knowledge stream analysis at the macroscopic level, and investigate the function of individual modules at the microscopic level. Drawing on knowledge streaming analyses, we decompose the knowledge utilization process into four distinct stages within LLM layers: knowledge refinement, knowledge elicitation, knowledge expression, and knowledge contestation. We further demonstrate that the relevance of passages guides the streaming of knowledge through these stages. At the module level, we introduce a new method, knowledge activation probability entropy (KAPE) for neuron identification associated with either internal or external knowledge. By selectively deactivating these neurons, we achieve targeted shifts in the LLM's reliance on one knowledge source over the other. Moreover, we discern complementary roles for multi-head attention and multi-layer perceptron layers during knowledge formation. These insights offer a foundation for improving interpretability and reliability in retrieval-augmented LLMs, paving the way for more robust and transparent generative solutions in knowledge-intensive domains.

      Despite significant advancements in terrestrial networks, inherent limitations persist in providing reliable coverage to remote areas and maintaining resilience during natural disasters. Multi-tier networks with low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites and high-altitude platforms (HAPs) offer promising solutions, but face challenges from high mobility and dynamic channel conditions that cause unstable connections and frequent handovers. In this paper, we design a three-tier network architecture that integrates LEO satellites, HAPs, and ground terminals with hybrid free-space optical (FSO) and radio frequency (RF) links to maximize coverage while maintaining connectivity reliability. This hybrid approach leverages the high bandwidth of FSO for satellite-to-HAP links and the weather resilience of RF for HAP-to-ground links. We formulate a joint optimization problem to simultaneously balance downlink transmission rate and handover frequency by optimizing network configuration and satellite handover decisions. The problem is highly dynamic and non-convex with time-coupled constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a novel large language model (LLM)-guided truncated quantile critics algorithm with dynamic action masking (LTQC-DAM) that utilizes dynamic action masking to eliminate unnecessary exploration and employs LLMs to adaptively tune hyperparameters. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed LTQC-DAM algorithm outperforms baseline algorithms in terms of convergence, downlink transmission rate, and handover frequency. We also reveal that compared to other state-of-the-art LLMs, DeepSeek delivers the best performance through gradual, contextually-aware parameter adjustments.

      PDDL-based symbolic task planning remains pivotal for robot autonomy yet struggles with dynamic human-robot collaboration due to scalability, re-planning demands, and delayed plan availability. Although a few neurosymbolic frameworks have previously leveraged LLMs such as GPT-3 to address these challenges, reliance on closed-source, remote models with limited context introduced critical constraints: third-party dependency, inconsistent response times, restricted plan length and complexity, and multi-domain scalability issues. We present Gideon, a novel framework that enables the transition to modern, smaller, local LLMs with extended context length. Gideon integrates a novel problem generator to systematically generate large-scale datasets of realistic domain-problem-plan tuples for any domain, and adapts neurosymbolic planning for local LLMs, enabling on-device execution and extended context for multi-domain support. Preliminary experiments in single-domain scenarios performed on Qwen-2.5 1.5B and trained on 8k-32k samples, demonstrate a valid plan percentage of 66.1% (32k model) and show that the figure can be further scaled through additional data. Multi-domain tests on 16k samples yield an even higher 70.6% planning validity rate, proving extensibility across domains and signaling that data variety can have a positive effect on learning efficiency. Although long-horizon planning and reduced model size make Gideon training much less efficient than baseline models based on larger LLMs, the results are still significant considering that the trained model is about 120x smaller than baseline and that significant advantages can be achieved in inference efficiency, scalability, and multi-domain adaptability, all critical factors in human-robot collaboration. Training inefficiency can be mitigated by Gideon's streamlined data generation pipeline.

      Loss reweighting has shown significant benefits for machine unlearning with large language models (LLMs). However, their exact functionalities are left unclear and the optimal strategy remains an open question, thus impeding the understanding and improvement of existing methodologies. In this paper, we identify two distinct goals of loss reweighting, namely, Saturation and Importance -- the former indicates that those insufficiently optimized data should be emphasized, while the latter stresses some critical data that are most influential for loss minimization. To study their usefulness, we design specific reweighting strategies for each goal and evaluate their respective effects on unlearning. We conduct extensive empirical analyses on well-established benchmarks, and summarize some important observations as follows: (i) Saturation enhances efficacy more than importance-based reweighting, and their combination can yield additional improvements. (ii) Saturation typically allocates lower weights to data with lower likelihoods, whereas importance-based reweighting does the opposite. (iii) The efficacy of unlearning is also largely influenced by the smoothness and granularity of the weight distributions. Based on these findings, we propose SatImp, a simple reweighting method that combines the advantages of both saturation and importance. Empirical results on extensive datasets validate the efficacy of our method, potentially bridging existing research gaps and indicating directions for future research.

      Lifelong learning is essential for intelligent agents operating in dynamic environments. Current large language model (LLM)-based agents, however, remain stateless and unable to accumulate or transfer knowledge over time. Existing benchmarks treat agents as static systems and fail to evaluate lifelong learning capabilities. We present LifelongAgentBench, the first unified benchmark designed to systematically assess the lifelong learning ability of LLM agents. It provides skill-grounded, interdependent tasks across three interactive environments, Database, Operating System, and Knowledge Graph, with automatic label verification, reproducibility, and modular extensibility. Extensive experiments reveal that conventional experience replay has limited effectiveness for LLM agents due to irrelevant information and context length constraints. We further introduce a group self-consistency mechanism that significantly improves lifelong learning performance. We hope LifelongAgentBench will advance the development of adaptive, memory-capable LLM agents.

      Existing large language models (LLMs) serving systems typically employ Prefill-Decode disaggregated architecture to prevent computational interference between the prefill and decode phases. However, real-world LLM serving scenarios often exhibit significant fluctuations in request input/output lengths, causing traditional static prefill/decode node configuration ratio to result in imbalanced computational loads between these two nodes, consequently preventing efficient utilization of computing resources to improve the system's goodput. To address this challenge, we design and implement Arrow, an adaptive scheduler that leverages stateless instances and elastic instance pools to achieve efficient adaptive request and instance scheduling. Arrow dynamically adjusts the number of instances handling prefill and decode tasks based on real-time cluster performance metrics, significantly enhancing the system's capability to handle traffic spikes and load variations. Our evaluation under diverse real-world workloads shows that Arrow achieves up to $5.62 \times$ and $7.78 \times$ higher request serving rates compared to state-of-the-art PD-colocated and PD-disaggregated serving systems respectively.
