      Large Language Models (LLMs) drive scientific question-answering on modern search engines, yet their evaluation robustness remains underexplored. We introduce YESciEval, an open-source framework that combines fine-grained rubric-based assessment with reinforcement learning to mitigate optimism bias in LLM evaluators. We release multidisciplinary scienceQ&A datasets, including adversarial variants, with evaluation scores from multiple LLMs. Independent of proprietary models and human feedback, our approach enables scalable, cost-free evaluation. By advancing reliable LLM-as-a-judge models, this work supports AI alignment and fosters robust, transparent evaluation essential for scientific inquiry.

      Formal logic enables computers to reason in natural language by representing sentences in symbolic forms and applying rules to derive conclusions. However, in what our study characterizes as "rulebreaker" scenarios, this method can lead to conclusions that are typically not inferred or accepted by humans given their common sense and factual knowledge. Inspired by works in cognitive science, we create RULEBREAKERS, the first dataset for rigorously evaluating the ability of large language models (LLMs) to recognize and respond to rulebreakers (versus non-rulebreakers) in a human-like manner. Evaluating seven LLMs, we find that most models, including GPT-4o, achieve mediocre accuracy on RULEBREAKERS and exhibit some tendency to over-rigidly apply logical rules unlike what is expected from typical human reasoners. Further analysis suggests that this apparent failure is potentially associated with the models' poor utilization of their world knowledge and their attention distribution patterns. Whilst revealing a limitation of current LLMs, our study also provides a timely counterbalance to a growing body of recent works that propose methods relying on formal logic to improve LLMs' general reasoning capabilities, highlighting their risk of further increasing divergence between LLMs and human-like reasoning.

      Lifelong learning is essential for intelligent agents operating in dynamic environments. Current large language model (LLM)-based agents, however, remain stateless and unable to accumulate or transfer knowledge over time. Existing benchmarks treat agents as static systems and fail to evaluate lifelong learning capabilities. We present LifelongAgentBench, the first unified benchmark designed to systematically assess the lifelong learning ability of LLM agents. It provides skill-grounded, interdependent tasks across three interactive environments, Database, Operating System, and Knowledge Graph, with automatic label verification, reproducibility, and modular extensibility. Extensive experiments reveal that conventional experience replay has limited effectiveness for LLM agents due to irrelevant information and context length constraints. We further introduce a group self-consistency mechanism that significantly improves lifelong learning performance. We hope LifelongAgentBench will advance the development of adaptive, memory-capable LLM agents.

      Large language model (LLM)-based agents have shown promise in tackling complex tasks by interacting dynamically with the environment. Existing work primarily focuses on behavior cloning from expert demonstrations or preference learning through exploratory trajectory sampling. However, these methods often struggle to address long-horizon tasks, where suboptimal actions accumulate step by step, causing agents to deviate from correct task trajectories. To address this, we highlight the importance of timely calibration and the need to automatically construct calibration trajectories for training agents. We propose Step-Level Trajectory Calibration (STeCa), a novel framework for LLM agent learning. Specifically, STeCa identifies suboptimal actions through a step-level reward comparison during exploration. It constructs calibrated trajectories using LLM-driven reflection, enabling agents to learn from improved decision-making processes. We finally leverage these calibrated trajectories with successful trajectories for reinforced training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STeCa significantly outperforms existing methods. Further analysis highlights that timely calibration enables agents to complete tasks with greater robustness. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/WangHanLinHenry/STeCa.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      This paper investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to recognise and solve tasks which have been obfuscated beyond recognition. Focusing on competitive programming and benchmark tasks (LeetCode and MATH), we compare performance across multiple models and obfuscation methods, such as noise and redaction. We demonstrate that all evaluated LLMs can solve tasks obfuscated to a level where the text would be unintelligible to human readers, and does not contain key pieces of instruction or context. We introduce the concept of eager pattern matching to describe this behaviour, which is not observed in tasks published after the models' knowledge cutoff date, indicating strong memorisation or overfitting to training data, rather than legitimate reasoning about the presented problem. We report empirical evidence of distinct performance decay patterns between contaminated and unseen datasets. We discuss the implications for benchmarking and evaluations of model behaviour, arguing for caution when designing experiments using standard datasets. We also propose measuring the decay of performance under obfuscation as a possible strategy for detecting dataset contamination and highlighting potential safety risks and interpretability issues for automated software systems.

      Unlocking deep, interpretable biological reasoning from complex genomic data is a major AI challenge hindering scientific discovery. Current DNA foundation models, despite strong sequence representation, struggle with multi-step reasoning and lack inherent transparent, biologically intuitive explanations. We introduce BioReason, a pioneering architecture that, for the first time, deeply integrates a DNA foundation model with a Large Language Model (LLM). This novel connection enables the LLM to directly process and reason with genomic information as a fundamental input, fostering a new form of multimodal biological understanding. BioReason's sophisticated multi-step reasoning is developed through supervised fine-tuning and targeted reinforcement learning, guiding the system to generate logical, biologically coherent deductions. On biological reasoning benchmarks including KEGG-based disease pathway prediction - where accuracy improves from 88% to 97% - and variant effect prediction, BioReason demonstrates an average 15% performance gain over strong single-modality baselines. BioReason reasons over unseen biological entities and articulates decision-making through interpretable, step-by-step biological traces, offering a transformative approach for AI in biology that enables deeper mechanistic insights and accelerates testable hypothesis generation from genomic data.

      Recent advancements in large language model (LLM) agents have significantly accelerated scientific discovery automation, yet concurrently raised critical ethical and safety concerns. To systematically address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{SafeScientist}, an innovative AI scientist framework explicitly designed to enhance safety and ethical responsibility in AI-driven scientific exploration. SafeScientist proactively refuses ethically inappropriate or high-risk tasks and rigorously emphasizes safety throughout the research process. To achieve comprehensive safety oversight, we integrate multiple defensive mechanisms, including prompt monitoring, agent-collaboration monitoring, tool-use monitoring, and an ethical reviewer component. Complementing SafeScientist, we propose \textbf{SciSafetyBench}, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate AI safety in scientific contexts, comprising 240 high-risk scientific tasks across 6 domains, alongside 30 specially designed scientific tools and 120 tool-related risk tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SafeScientist significantly improves safety performance by 35\% compared to traditional AI scientist frameworks, without compromising scientific output quality. Additionally, we rigorously validate the robustness of our safety pipeline against diverse adversarial attack methods, further confirming the effectiveness of our integrated approach.

      Large language models (LLMs) are enabling designers to give life to exciting new user experiences for information access. In this work, we present a system that generates LLM personas to debate a topic of interest from different perspectives. How might information seekers use and benefit from such a system? Can centering information access around diverse viewpoints help to mitigate thorny challenges like confirmation bias in which information seekers over-trust search results matching existing beliefs? How do potential biases and hallucinations in LLMs play out alongside human users who are also fallible and possibly biased? Our study exposes participants to multiple viewpoints on controversial issues via a mixed-methods, within-subjects study. We use eye-tracking metrics to quantitatively assess cognitive engagement alongside qualitative feedback. Compared to a baseline search system, we see more creative interactions and diverse information-seeking with our multi-persona debate system, which more effectively reduces user confirmation bias and conviction toward their initial beliefs. Overall, our study contributes to the emerging design space of LLM-based information access systems, specifically investigating the potential of simulated personas to promote greater exposure to information diversity, emulate collective intelligence, and mitigate bias in information seeking.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      In recent years, Large Language Models (LLM) such as ChatGPT, CoPilot, and Gemini have been widely adopted in different areas. As the use of LLMs continues to grow, many efforts have focused on reducing the massive training overheads of these models. But it is the environmental impact of handling user requests to LLMs that is increasingly becoming a concern. Recent studies estimate that the costs of operating LLMs in their inference phase can exceed training costs by 25x per year. As LLMs are queried incessantly, the cumulative carbon footprint for the operational phase has been shown to far exceed the footprint during the training phase. Further, estimates indicate that 500 ml of fresh water is expended for every 20-50 requests to LLMs during inference. To address these important sustainability issues with LLMs, we propose a novel framework called SLIT to co-optimize LLM quality of service (time-to-first token), carbon emissions, water usage, and energy costs. The framework utilizes a machine learning (ML) based metaheuristic to enhance the sustainability of LLM hosting across geo-distributed cloud datacenters. Such a framework will become increasingly vital as LLMs proliferate.

      Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are complex systems that integrate physical, computational, and communication subsystems. The heterogeneous nature of these systems makes their safety assurance challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel automated approach for guardrailing cyber-physical systems using property-based tests (PBTs) generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach employs an LLM to extract properties from the code and documentation of CPSs. Next, we use the LLM to generate PBTs that verify the extracted properties on the CPS. The generated PBTs have two uses. First, they are used to test the CPS before it is deployed, i.e., at design time. Secondly, these PBTs can be used after deployment, i.e., at run time, to monitor the behavior of the system and guardrail it against unsafe states. We implement our approach in ChekProp and conduct preliminary experiments to evaluate the generated PBTs in terms of their relevance (how well they match manually crafted properties), executability (how many run with minimal manual modification), and effectiveness (coverage of the input space partitions). The results of our experiments and evaluation demonstrate a promising path forward for creating guardrails for CPSs using LLM-generated property-based tests.

      Motivated by Smart Manufacturing and Industry 4.0, we introduce a framework for synthesizing Abstraction-Based Controller Design (ABCD) for reach-avoid problems from Natural Language (NL) specifications using Large Language Models (LLMs). A Code Agent interprets an NL description of the control problem and translates it into a formal language interpretable by state-of-the-art symbolic control software, while a Checker Agent verifies the correctness of the generated code and enhances safety by identifying specification mismatches. Evaluations show that the system handles linguistic variability and improves robustness over direct planning with LLMs. The proposed approach lowers the barrier to formal control synthesis by enabling intuitive, NL-based task definition while maintaining safety guarantees through automated validation.

      Recent advances in preference optimization have demonstrated significant potential for improving mathematical reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs). While current approaches leverage high-quality pairwise preference data through outcome-based criteria like answer correctness or consistency, they fundamentally neglect the internal logical coherence of responses. To overcome this, we propose Probability-Consistent Preference Optimization (PCPO), a novel framework that establishes dual quantitative metrics for preference selection: (1) surface-level answer correctness and (2) intrinsic token-level probability consistency across responses. Extensive experiments show that our PCPO consistently outperforms existing outcome-only criterion approaches across a diverse range of LLMs and benchmarks.

      LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) have shown promise in tackling complex tasks. However, existing solutions often suffer from limited agent coordination and heavy reliance on predefined Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), which demand extensive human input. To address these limitations, we propose MegaAgent, a large-scale autonomous LLM-based multi-agent system. MegaAgent generates agents based on task complexity and enables dynamic task decomposition, parallel execution, efficient communication, and comprehensive system monitoring of agents. In evaluations, MegaAgent demonstrates exceptional performance, successfully developing a Gobang game within 800 seconds and scaling up to 590 agents in a national policy simulation to generate multi-domain policies. It significantly outperforms existing systems, such as MetaGPT, in both task completion efficiency and scalability. By eliminating the need for predefined SOPs, MegaAgent demonstrates exceptional scalability and autonomy, setting a foundation for advancing true autonomy in MAS.

      Large language models (LLMs) frequently refuse to respond to pseudo-malicious instructions: semantically harmless input queries triggering unnecessary LLM refusals due to conservative safety alignment, significantly impairing user experience. Collecting such instructions is crucial for evaluating and mitigating over-refusals, but existing instruction curation methods, like manual creation or instruction rewriting, either lack scalability or fail to produce sufficiently diverse and effective refusal-inducing prompts. To address these limitations, we introduce EVOREFUSE, a prompt optimization approach that generates diverse pseudo-malicious instructions consistently eliciting confident refusals across LLMs. EVOREFUSE employs an evolutionary algorithm exploring the instruction space in more diverse directions than existing methods via mutation strategies and recombination, and iteratively evolves seed instructions to maximize evidence lower bound on LLM refusal probability. Using EVOREFUSE, we create two novel datasets: EVOREFUSE-TEST, a benchmark of 582 pseudo-malicious instructions that outperforms the next-best benchmark with 140.41% higher average refusal triggering rate across 9 LLMs, 34.86% greater lexical diversity, and 40.03% improved LLM response confidence scores; and EVOREFUSE-ALIGN, which provides 3,000 pseudo-malicious instructions with responses for supervised and preference-based alignment training. LLAMA3.1-8B-INSTRUCT supervisedly fine-tuned on EVOREFUSE-ALIGN achieves up to 14.31% fewer over-refusals than models trained on the second-best alignment dataset, without compromising safety. Our analysis with EVOREFUSE-TEST reveals models trigger over-refusals by overly focusing on sensitive keywords while ignoring broader context.

      The proliferation of open-sourced Large Language Models (LLMs) and diverse downstream tasks necessitates efficient model selection, given the impracticality of fine-tuning all candidates due to computational constraints. Despite the recent advances in LLM selection, a fundamental research question largely remains nascent: how can we model the dynamic behaviors of LLMs during fine-tuning, thereby enhancing our understanding of their generalization performance across diverse downstream tasks? In this work, we propose a novel theoretical framework that provides a proper lens to assess the generalization capabilities of LLMs, thereby enabling accurate and efficient LLM selection for downstream applications. In particular, we first derive a PAC-Bayesian Generalization Bound that unveils fine-tuning dynamics of LLMs and then introduce LENSLLM, a Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)-based Rectified Scaling Model that enables accurate performance predictions across diverse tasks while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive empirical results on 3 large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves up to 91.1% accuracy and reduces up to 88.5% computational cost in LLM selection, outperforming 5 state-of-the-art methods. We open-source our proposed LENSLLM model and corresponding results at LensLLM.io.

      Handling unanswerable questions (UAQ) is crucial for LLMs, as it helps prevent misleading responses in complex situations. While previous studies have built several datasets to assess LLMs' performance on UAQ, these datasets lack factual knowledge support, which limits the evaluation of LLMs' ability to utilize their factual knowledge when handling UAQ. To address the limitation, we introduce a new unanswerable question dataset UAQFact, a bilingual dataset with auxiliary factual knowledge created from a Knowledge Graph. Based on UAQFact, we further define two new tasks to measure LLMs' ability to utilize internal and external factual knowledge, respectively. Our experimental results across multiple LLM series show that UAQFact presents significant challenges, as LLMs do not consistently perform well even when they have factual knowledge stored. Additionally, we find that incorporating external knowledge may enhance performance, but LLMs still cannot make full use of the knowledge which may result in incorrect responses.

Our method introduces custom reward functions that guide the model not only toward high prediction accuracy but also toward human-understandable reasons for its predictions.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuning technologies have achieved remarkable results. However, traditional LLM fine-tuning approaches face significant challenges: they require large Floating Point (FP) computation, raising privacy concerns when handling sensitive data, and are impractical for resource-constrained edge devices. While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques reduce trainable parameters, their reliance on floating-point arithmetic creates fundamental incompatibilities with edge hardware. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for on-device LLM fine-tuning that eliminates the need for floating-point operations in both inference and training, named GSQ-Tuning. At its core is the Group-Shared Exponents Integer format, which efficiently represents model parameters in integer format using shared exponents among parameter groups. When combined with LoRA-like adapters, this enables fully integer-based fine-tuning that is both memory and compute efficient. We demonstrate that our approach achieves accuracy comparable to BF16-based fine-tuning while significantly reducing 1.85x memory usage. Moreover, compared to FP8, our method can reduce 5x power consumption and 11x chip area with same performance, making large-scale model adaptation feasible on edge devices.

      Reasoning-enabled large language models (LLMs) excel in logical tasks, yet their utility for evaluating natural language generation remains unexplored. This study systematically compares reasoning LLMs with non-reasoning counterparts across machine translation and text summarization evaluation tasks. We evaluate eight models spanning state-of-the-art reasoning models (DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI o3), their distilled variants (8B-70B parameters), and equivalent non-reasoning LLMs. Experiments on WMT23 and SummEval benchmarks reveal architecture and task-dependent benefits: OpenAI o3-mini models show improved performance with increased reasoning on MT, while DeepSeek-R1 and generally underperforms compared to its non-reasoning variant except in summarization consistency evaluation. Correlation analysis demonstrates that reasoning token usage correlates with evaluation quality only in specific models, while almost all models generally allocate more reasoning tokens when identifying more quality issues. Distillation maintains reasonable performance up to 32B parameter models but degrades substantially at 8B scale. This work provides the first assessment of reasoning LLMs for NLG evaluation and comparison to non-reasoning models.

      Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet they often refuse to answer legitimate queries-a phenomenon known as overrefusal. Overrefusal typically stems from over-conservative safety alignment, causing models to treat many reasonable prompts as potentially risky. To systematically understand this issue, we probe and leverage the models'safety decision boundaries to analyze and mitigate overrefusal. Our findings reveal that overrefusal is closely tied to misalignment at these boundary regions, where models struggle to distinguish subtle differences between benign and harmful content. Building on these insights, we present RASS, an automated framework for prompt generation and selection that strategically targets overrefusal prompts near the safety boundary. By harnessing steering vectors in the representation space, RASS efficiently identifies and curates boundary-aligned prompts, enabling more effective and targeted mitigation of overrefusal. This approach not only provides a more precise and interpretable view of model safety decisions but also seamlessly extends to multilingual scenarios.We have explored the safety decision boundaries of various LLMs and construct the MORBench evaluation set to facilitate robust assessment of model safety and helpfulness across multiple languages. Code and datasets will be released at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/RASS-80D3.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are primarily designed for batch processing. Existing methods for adapting LLMs to streaming rely either on expensive re-encoding or specialized architectures with limited scalability. This work identifies three key mismatches in adapting batch-oriented LLMs to streaming: (1) input-attention, (2) output-attention, and (3) position-ID mismatches. While it is commonly assumed that the latter two mismatches require frequent re-encoding, our analysis reveals that only the input-attention mismatch significantly impacts performance, indicating re-encoding outputs is largely unnecessary. To better understand this discrepancy with the common assumption, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of the impact of position encoding on LLMs in streaming, showing that preserving relative positions within source and target contexts is more critical than maintaining absolute order. Motivated by the above analysis, we introduce a group position encoding paradigm built on batch architectures to enhance consistency between streaming and batch modes. Extensive experiments on cross-lingual and cross-modal tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches. Our method requires no architectural modifications, exhibits strong generalization in both streaming and batch modes. The code is available at repository https://github.com/EIT-NLP/StreamingLLM.

      When the complete source sentence is provided, Large Language Models (LLMs) perform excellently in offline machine translation even with a simple prompt "Translate the following sentence from [src lang] into [tgt lang]:". However, in many real scenarios, the source tokens arrive in a streaming manner and simultaneous machine translation (SiMT) is required, then the efficiency and performance of decoder-only LLMs are significantly limited by their auto-regressive nature. To enable LLMs to achieve high-quality SiMT as efficiently as offline translation, we propose a novel paradigm that includes constructing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data for SiMT, along with new training and inference strategies. To replicate the token input/output stream in SiMT, the source and target tokens are rearranged into an interleaved sequence, separated by special tokens according to varying latency requirements. This enables powerful LLMs to learn read and write operations adaptively, based on varying latency prompts, while still maintaining efficient auto-regressive decoding. Experimental results show that, even with limited SFT data, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across various SiMT benchmarks, and preserves the original abilities of offline translation. Moreover, our approach generalizes well to document-level SiMT setting without requiring specific fine-tuning, even beyond the offline translation model.

      Factual knowledge extraction aims to explicitly extract knowledge parameterized in pre-trained language models for application in downstream tasks. While prior work has been investigating the impact of supervised fine-tuning data on the factuality of large language models (LLMs), its mechanism remains poorly understood. We revisit this impact through systematic experiments, with a particular focus on the factuality gap that arises when fine-tuning on known versus unknown knowledge. Our findings show that this gap can be mitigated at the inference stage, either under out-of-distribution (OOD) settings or by using appropriate in-context learning (ICL) prompts (i.e., few-shot learning and Chain of Thought (CoT)). We prove this phenomenon theoretically from the perspective of knowledge graphs, showing that the test-time prompt may diminish or even overshadow the impact of fine-tuning data and play a dominant role in knowledge extraction. Ultimately, our results shed light on the interaction between finetuning data and test-time prompt, demonstrating that ICL can effectively compensate for shortcomings in fine-tuning data, and highlighting the need to reconsider the use of ICL prompting as a means to evaluate the effectiveness of fine-tuning data selection methods.

      Large language models (LLMs) are often used for infilling tasks, which involve predicting or generating missing information in a given text. These tasks typically require multiple interactions with similar context. To reduce the computation of repeated historical tokens, cross-request key-value (KV) cache reuse, a technique that stores and reuses intermediate computations, has become a crucial method in multi-round interactive services. However, in infilling tasks, the KV cache reuse is often hindered by the structure of the prompt format, which typically consists of a prefix and suffix relative to the insertion point. Specifically, the KV cache of the prefix or suffix part is frequently invalidated as the other part (suffix or prefix) is incrementally generated. To address the issue, we propose EFIM, a transformed prompt format of FIM to unleash the performance potential of KV cache reuse. Although the transformed prompt can solve the inefficiency, it exposes subtoken generation problems in current LLMs, where they have difficulty generating partial words accurately. Therefore, we introduce a fragment tokenization training method which splits text into multiple fragments before tokenization during data processing. Experiments on two representative LLMs show that LLM serving with EFIM can lower the latency by 52% and improve the throughput by 98% while maintaining the original infilling capability. EFIM's source code is publicly available at https://github.com/gty111/EFIM.

      Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in enhancing dense retrieval through query augmentation. However, most existing methods treat the LLM and the retriever as separate modules, overlooking the alignment between generation and ranking objectives. In this work, we propose ExpandR, a unified LLM-augmented dense retrieval framework that jointly optimizes both the LLM and the retriever. ExpandR employs the LLM to generate semantically rich query expansions, which are leveraged to enhance the retriever's training. Simultaneously, the LLM is trained using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), guided by a carefully designed reward function that balances retrieval effectiveness and generation consistency. This joint optimization paradigm enables mutual adaptation between the LLM and the retriever, resulting in query expansions that are both informative and well-suited for retrieval. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks show that ExpandR consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving more than a 5% improvement in retrieval performance.

      In this position paper we raise critical awareness of a realistic view of LLM capabilities that eschews extreme alternative views that LLMs are either "stochastic parrots" or in possession of "emergent" advanced reasoning capabilities, which, due to their unpredictable emergence, constitute an existential threat. Our middle-ground view is that LLMs extrapolate from priors from their training data, and that a mechanism akin to in-context learning enables the targeting of the appropriate information from which to extrapolate. We call this "context-directed extrapolation." Under this view, substantiated though existing literature, while reasoning capabilities go well beyond stochastic parroting, such capabilities are predictable, controllable, not indicative of advanced reasoning akin to high-level cognitive capabilities in humans, and not infinitely scalable with additional training. As a result, fears of uncontrollable emergence of agency are allayed, while research advances are appropriately refocused on the processes of context-directed extrapolation and how this interacts with training data to produce valuable capabilities in LLMs. Future work can therefore explore alternative augmenting techniques that do not rely on inherent advanced reasoning in LLMs.

But proofs have to be provided that are human-readable. Here, we study how modern approaches from Artificial Intelligence (AI) based on Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used to generate proofs that later on can be validated based on reasoning engines. Examples are given that show how LLMs can interact with proof engines, and directions for future work are outlined.

      Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to classify both known and novel categories using partially labeled data that contains only known classes. Despite achieving strong performance on existing benchmarks, current textual GCD methods lack sufficient validation in realistic settings. We introduce Event-Centric GCD (EC-GCD), characterized by long, complex narratives and highly imbalanced class distributions, posing two main challenges: (1) divergent clustering versus classification groupings caused by subjective criteria, and (2) Unfair alignment for minority classes. To tackle these, we propose PaMA, a framework leveraging LLMs to extract and refine event patterns for improved cluster-class alignment. Additionally, a ranking-filtering-mining pipeline ensures balanced representation of prototypes across imbalanced categories. Evaluations on two EC-GCD benchmarks, including a newly constructed Scam Report dataset, demonstrate that PaMA outperforms prior methods with up to 12.58% H-score gains, while maintaining strong generalization on base GCD datasets.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are increasingly deployed in industry applications, yet their reliability remains hampered by challenges in detecting hallucinations. While supervised state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods that leverage LLM hidden states -- such as activation tracing and representation analysis -- show promise, their dependence on extensively annotated datasets limits scalability in real-world applications. This paper addresses the critical bottleneck of data annotation by investigating the feasibility of reducing training data requirements for two SOTA hallucination detection frameworks: Lookback Lens, which analyzes attention head dynamics, and probing-based approaches, which decode internal model representations. We propose a methodology combining efficient classification algorithms with dimensionality reduction techniques to minimize sample size demands while maintaining competitive performance. Evaluations on standardized question-answering RAG benchmarks show that our approach achieves performance comparable to strong proprietary LLM-based baselines with only 250 training samples. These results highlight the potential of lightweight, data-efficient paradigms for industrial deployment, particularly in annotation-constrained scenarios.

      Social conventions are the backbone of social coordination, shaping how individuals form a group. As growing populations of artificial intelligence (AI) agents communicate through natural language, a fundamental question is whether they can bootstrap the foundations of a society. Here, we present experimental results that demonstrate the spontaneous emergence of universally adopted social conventions in decentralized populations of large language model (LLM) agents. We then show how strong collective biases can emerge during this process, even when agents exhibit no bias individually. Last, we examine how committed minority groups of adversarial LLM agents can drive social change by imposing alternative social conventions on the larger population. Our results show that AI systems can autonomously develop social conventions without explicit programming and have implications for designing AI systems that align, and remain aligned, with human values and societal goals.

      Uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) encompass a variety of approaches, with two major types being particularly prominent: information-based, which focus on model confidence expressed as token probabilities, and consistency-based, which assess the semantic relationship between multiple outputs generated using repeated sampling. Several recent methods have combined these two approaches to boost UQ performance. However, they sometimes fail to outperform much simpler baseline methods. Our work discusses the fundamental approach to constructing uncertainty measures that directly links uncertainty with the minimum Bayes risks achieved by LLM decoding. Building on these findings, we propose a novel approach to integrating model confidence with output consistency, resulting in a family of efficient and robust UQ methods. Our investigation reveals distinctive characteristics of LLMs as probabilistic models, which help to explain why these UQ methods underperform in certain tasks. Based on these findings, we propose a new way of synthesizing model confidence and output consistency, leading to a family of efficient and robust UQ methods. We evaluate our approach across various tasks such as question answering, abstractive summarization, and machine translation, demonstrating sizable improvements over state-of-the-art UQ approaches.

      The rapid advancement of reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs) has led to notable improvements on mathematical benchmarks. However, many of the most commonly used evaluation datasets (e.g., AIME 2024) are widely available online, making it difficult to disentangle genuine reasoning from potential memorization. Furthermore, these benchmarks do not evaluate proof-writing capabilities, which are crucial for many mathematical tasks. To address this, we introduce MathArena, a new benchmark based on the following key insight: recurring math competitions provide a stream of high-quality, challenging problems that can be used for real-time evaluation of LLMs. By evaluating models as soon as new problems are released, we effectively eliminate the risk of contamination. Using this framework, we find strong signs of contamination in AIME 2024. Nonetheless, evaluations on harder competitions, such as SMT 2025 -- published well after model release dates -- demonstrate impressive reasoning capabilities in top-performing models. MathArena is also the first benchmark for proof-writing capabilities. On USAMO 2025, even top models score below 25%, far behind their performance on final-answer tasks. So far, we have evaluated 30 models across five competitions, totaling 149 problems. As an evolving benchmark, MathArena will continue to track the progress of LLMs on newly released competitions, ensuring rigorous and up-to-date evaluation of mathematical reasoning.

      Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) with external context, but retrieved passages are often lengthy, noisy, or exceed input limits. Existing compression methods typically require supervised training of dedicated compression models, increasing cost and reducing portability. We propose Sentinel, a lightweight sentence-level compression framework that reframes context filtering as an attention-based understanding task. Rather than training a compression model, Sentinel probes decoder attention from an off-the-shelf 0.5B proxy LLM using a lightweight classifier to identify sentence relevance. Empirically, we find that query-context relevance estimation is consistent across model scales, with 0.5B proxies closely matching the behaviors of larger models. On the LongBench benchmark, Sentinel achieves up to 5$\times$ compression while matching the QA performance of 7B-scale compression systems. Our results suggest that probing native attention signals enables fast, effective, and question-aware context compression. Code available at: https://github.com/yzhangchuck/Sentinel.

      In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements, drawing significant attention from the research community. Their capabilities are largely attributed to large-scale architectures, which require extensive training on massive datasets. However, such datasets often contain sensitive or copyrighted content sourced from the public internet, raising concerns about data privacy and ownership. Regulatory frameworks, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), grant individuals the right to request the removal of such sensitive information. This has motivated the development of machine unlearning algorithms that aim to remove specific knowledge from models without the need for costly retraining. Despite these advancements, evaluating the efficacy of unlearning algorithms remains a challenge due to the inherent complexity and generative nature of LLMs. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive auditing framework for unlearning evaluation, comprising three benchmark datasets, six unlearning algorithms, and five prompt-based auditing methods. By using various auditing algorithms, we evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of different unlearning strategies. To explore alternatives beyond prompt-based auditing, we propose a novel technique that leverages intermediate activation perturbations, addressing the limitations of auditing methods that rely solely on model inputs and outputs.

      Proteins, as essential biomolecules, play a central role in biological processes, including metabolic reactions and DNA replication. Accurate prediction of their properties and functions is crucial in biological applications. Recent development of protein language models (pLMs) with supervised fine tuning provides a promising solution to this problem. However, the fine-tuned model is tailored for particular downstream prediction task, and achieving general-purpose protein understanding remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce Structure-Enhanced Protein Instruction Tuning (SEPIT) framework to bridge this gap. Our approach incorporates a novel structure-aware module into pLMs to enrich their structural knowledge, and subsequently integrates these enhanced pLMs with large language models (LLMs) to advance protein understanding. In this framework, we propose a novel instruction tuning pipeline. First, we warm up the enhanced pLMs using contrastive learning and structure denoising. Then, caption-based instructions are used to establish a basic understanding of proteins. Finally, we refine this understanding by employing a mixture of experts (MoEs) to capture more complex properties and functional information with the same number of activated parameters. Moreover, we construct the largest and most comprehensive protein instruction dataset to date, which allows us to train and evaluate the general-purpose protein understanding model. Extensive experiments on both open-ended generation and closed-set answer tasks demonstrate the superior performance of SEPIT over both closed-source general LLMs and open-source LLMs trained with protein knowledge.

      Owing to the huge success of generative artificial intelligence (AI), large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a core subclass, underpinning applications such as question answering, text generation, and code completion. While fine-tuning these models on domain-specific data can yield significant performance gains, it also poses daunting computational challenges, especially for researchers and small organizations with limited hardware resources. Although SSD offloading (i.e., ZeRO-Infinity) has emerged as a viable strategy to overcome the GPU memory barrier via leveraging both system memory (i.e., CPU DRAM) and storage space (i.e., solid-state devices, SSDs), its design primarily targets model-centric performance issues. As a result, key system-level issues, including system memory fragmentation, inefficient pinned buffer allocation, peak CPU usage spikes, and file system overhead, remain unaddressed, stifling scalability and inflating costs. Such an observation motivates this paper to introduce MemAscend, a framework that systematically tackles the underexplored system memory bottlenecks in SSD-offloaded LLM training, with a focus on resource-constrained environments. By streamlining pinned-memory allocation, eradicating fragmentation, and mitigating peak overhead, MemAscend reclaims a substantial system memory budget, enabling larger models, longer context windows, and higher batch sizes without exceeding modest hardware limits. Across diverse LLM benchmarks, MemAscend reduces peak system-memory consumption by an average of 55.7% compared with standard SSD offloading techniques, lowering the hardware barrier for fine-tuning and unlocking new possibilities for cost-effective large-scale training on limited-resource machines.

      In-situ LLM inference on end-user devices has gained significant interest due to its privacy benefits and reduced dependency on external infrastructure. However, as the decoding process is memory-bandwidth-bound, the diverse processing units in modern end-user devices cannot be fully exploited, resulting in slow LLM inference. This paper presents Ghidorah, a LLM inference system for end-user devices with the unified memory architecture. The key idea of Ghidorah can be summarized in two steps: 1) leveraging speculative decoding approaches to enhance parallelism, and 2) ingeniously distributing workloads across multiple heterogeneous processing units to maximize computing power utilization. Ghidorah includes the hetero-core model parallelism (HCMP) architecture and the architecture-aware profiling (ARCA) approach. The HCMP architecture guides partitioning by leveraging the unified memory design of end-user devices and adapting to the hybrid computational demands of speculative decoding. The ARCA approach is used to determine the optimal speculative strategy and partitioning strategy, balancing acceptance rate with parallel capability to maximize the speedup. Additionally, we optimize sparse computation on ARM CPUs. Experimental results show that Ghidorah can achieve up to 7.6x speedup in the dominant LLM decoding phase compared to the sequential decoding approach in NVIDIA Jetson NX.

      Recent studies provide large language models (LLMs) with textual task-solving experiences via prompts to improve their performance. However, previous methods rely on substantial human labor or time to gather such experiences for each task, which is impractical given the growing variety of task types in user queries to LLMs. To address this issue, we design an autonomous experience transfer framework to explore whether LLMs can mimic human cognitive intelligence to autonomously transfer experience from existing source tasks to newly encountered target tasks. This not only allows the acquisition of experience without extensive costs of previous methods, but also offers a novel path for the generalization of LLMs. Experimental results on 13 datasets demonstrate that our framework effectively improves the performance of LLMs. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of each module in the framework.

      Large Language Model-based multi-agent systems (MAS) have shown remarkable progress in solving complex tasks through collaborative reasoning and inter-agent critique. However, existing approaches typically treat each task in isolation, resulting in redundant computations and limited generalization across structurally similar tasks. To address this, we introduce multi-agent cross-task experiential learning (MAEL), a novel framework that endows LLM-driven agents with explicit cross-task learning and experience accumulation. We model the task-solving workflow on a graph-structured multi-agent collaboration network, where agents propagate information and coordinate via explicit connectivity. During the experiential learning phase, we quantify the quality for each step in the task-solving workflow and store the resulting rewards along with the corresponding inputs and outputs into each agent's individual experience pool. During inference, agents retrieve high-reward, task-relevant experiences as few-shot examples to enhance the effectiveness of each reasoning step, thereby enabling more accurate and efficient multi-agent collaboration. Experimental results on diverse datasets demonstrate that MAEL empowers agents to learn from prior task experiences effectively-achieving faster convergence and producing higher-quality solutions on current tasks.

      As large language models (LLMs) often generate plausible but incorrect content, error detection has become increasingly critical to ensure truthfulness. However, existing detection methods often overlook a critical problem we term as self-consistent error, where LLMs repeatly generate the same incorrect response across multiple stochastic samples. This work formally defines self-consistent errors and evaluates mainstream detection methods on them. Our investigation reveals two key findings: (1) Unlike inconsistent errors, whose frequency diminishes significantly as LLM scale increases, the frequency of self-consistent errors remains stable or even increases. (2) All four types of detection methshods significantly struggle to detect self-consistent errors. These findings reveal critical limitations in current detection methods and underscore the need for improved methods. Motivated by the observation that self-consistent errors often differ across LLMs, we propose a simple but effective cross-model probe method that fuses hidden state evidence from an external verifier LLM. Our method significantly enhances performance on self-consistent errors across three LLM families.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to automate programming tasks. Yet, LLMs' capabilities in reasoning about program semantics are still inadequately studied, leaving significant potential for further exploration. This paper introduces FormalBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' reasoning abilities on program semantics, particularly via the task of synthesizing formal program specifications to assist verifying program correctness. This task requires both comprehensive reasoning over all possible program executions and the generation of precise, syntactically correct expressions that adhere to formal syntax and semantics. Using this benchmark, we evaluated the ability of LLMs in synthesizing consistent and complete specifications. Our findings show that LLMs perform well with simple control flows but struggle with more complex structures, especially loops, even with advanced prompting. Additionally, LLMs exhibit limited robustness against semantic-preserving transformations. We also highlight common failure patterns and design self-repair prompts, improving success rates by 25%.

      Despite the growing development of long-context large language models (LLMs), data-centric approaches relying on synthetic data have been hindered by issues related to faithfulness, which limit their effectiveness in enhancing model performance on tasks such as long-context reasoning and question answering (QA). These challenges are often exacerbated by misinformation caused by lack of verification, reasoning without attribution, and potential knowledge conflicts. We propose LongFaith, a novel pipeline for synthesizing faithful long-context reasoning instruction datasets. By integrating ground truth and citation-based reasoning prompts, we eliminate distractions and improve the accuracy of reasoning chains, thus mitigating the need for costly verification processes. We open-source two synthesized datasets, LongFaith-SFT and LongFaith-PO, which systematically address multiple dimensions of faithfulness, including verified reasoning, attribution, and contextual grounding. Extensive experiments on multi-hop reasoning datasets and LongBench demonstrate that models fine-tuned on these datasets significantly improve performance. Our ablation studies highlight the scalability and adaptability of the LongFaith pipeline, showcasing its broad applicability in developing long-context LLMs.

      As the AI systems become deeply embedded in social media platforms, we've uncovered a concerning security vulnerability that goes beyond traditional adversarial attacks. It becomes important to assess the risks of LLMs before the general public use them on social media platforms to avoid any adverse impacts. Unlike obvious nonsensical text strings that safety systems can easily catch, our work reveals that human-readable situation-driven adversarial full-prompts that leverage situational context are effective but much harder to detect. We found that skilled attackers can exploit the vulnerabilities in open-source and proprietary LLMs to make a malicious user query safe for LLMs, resulting in generating a harmful response. This raises an important question about the vulnerabilities of LLMs. To measure the robustness against human-readable attacks, which now present a potent threat, our research makes three major contributions. First, we developed attacks that use movie scripts as situational contextual frameworks, creating natural-looking full-prompts that trick LLMs into generating harmful content. Second, we developed a method to transform gibberish adversarial text into readable, innocuous content that still exploits vulnerabilities when used within the full-prompts. Finally, we enhanced the AdvPrompter framework with p-nucleus sampling to generate diverse human-readable adversarial texts that significantly improve attack effectiveness against models like GPT-3.5-Turbo-0125 and Gemma-7b. Our findings show that these systems can be manipulated to operate beyond their intended ethical boundaries when presented with seemingly normal prompts that contain hidden adversarial elements. By identifying these vulnerabilities, we aim to drive the development of more robust safety mechanisms that can withstand sophisticated attacks in real-world applications.

      E-commerce sellers are recommended keyphrases based on their inventory on which they advertise to increase buyer engagement (clicks/sales). The relevance of advertiser keyphrases plays an important role in preventing the inundation of search systems with numerous irrelevant items that compete for attention in auctions, in addition to maintaining a healthy seller perception. In this work, we describe the shortcomings of training Advertiser keyphrase relevance filter models on click/sales/search relevance signals and the importance of aligning with human judgment, as sellers have the power to adopt or reject said keyphrase recommendations. In this study, we frame Advertiser keyphrase relevance as a complex interaction between 3 dynamical systems -- seller judgment, which influences seller adoption of our product, Advertising, which provides the keyphrases to bid on, and Search, who holds the auctions for the same keyphrases. This study discusses the practicalities of using human judgment via a case study at eBay Advertising and demonstrate that using LLM-as-a-judge en-masse as a scalable proxy for seller judgment to train our relevance models achieves a better harmony across the three systems -- provided that they are bound by a meticulous evaluation framework grounded in business metrics.

      The remarkable reasoning and generalization capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have paved the way for their expanding applications in embodied AI, robotics, and other real-world tasks. To effectively support these applications, grounding in spatial and temporal understanding in multimodal environments is essential. To this end, recent works have leveraged scene graphs, a structured representation that encodes entities, attributes, and their relationships in a scene. However, a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' ability to utilize scene graphs remains limited. In this work, we introduce Text-Scene Graph (TSG) Bench, a benchmark designed to systematically assess LLMs' ability to (1) understand scene graphs and (2) generate them from textual narratives. With TSG Bench we evaluate 11 LLMs and reveal that, while models perform well on scene graph understanding, they struggle with scene graph generation, particularly for complex narratives. Our analysis indicates that these models fail to effectively decompose discrete scenes from a complex narrative, leading to a bottleneck when generating scene graphs. These findings underscore the need for improved methodologies in scene graph generation and provide valuable insights for future research.

      LLM providers typically offer multiple LLM tiers, varying in performance and price. As NLP tasks become more complex and modularized, selecting the suitable LLM tier for each subtask is a key challenge to balance between cost and performance. To address the problem, we introduce LLM Automatic Transmission (LLM-AT) framework that automatically selects LLM tiers without training. LLM-AT consists of Starter, Generator, and Judge. The starter selects the initial LLM tier expected to solve the given question, the generator produces a response using the LLM of the selected tier, and the judge evaluates the validity of the response. If the response is invalid, LLM-AT iteratively upgrades to a higher-tier model, generates a new response, and re-evaluates until a valid response is obtained. Additionally, we propose accuracy estimator, which enables the suitable initial LLM tier selection without training. Given an input question, accuracy estimator estimates the expected accuracy of each LLM tier by computing the valid response rate across top-k similar queries from past inference records. Experiments demonstrate that LLM-AT achieves superior performance while reducing costs, making it a practical solution for real-world applications.

      Diffusion LLMs have emerged as a promising alternative to conventional autoregressive LLMs, offering significant potential for improved runtime efficiency. However, existing diffusion models lack the ability to provably enforce user-specified formal constraints, such as regular expressions, which makes them unreliable for tasks that require structured outputs, such as fixed-schema JSON generation. Unlike autoregressive models that generate tokens sequentially, diffusion LLMs predict a block of tokens in parallel. This parallelism makes traditional constrained decoding algorithms, which are designed for sequential token prediction, ineffective at preserving the true output distribution. To address this limitation, we propose DINGO, a dynamic programming-based constrained decoding strategy that is both efficient and provably distribution-preserving. DINGO enables sampling of output strings with the highest probability under the model's predicted distribution, while strictly satisfying any user-specified regular expression. On standard symbolic math and JSON generation benchmarks, DINGO achieves up to a 68 percentage point improvement over unconstrained inference

      Recent advancements have significantly enhanced the performance of large language models (LLMs) in tackling complex reasoning tasks, achieving notable success in domains like mathematical and logical reasoning. However, these methods encounter challenges with complex planning tasks, primarily due to extended reasoning steps, diverse constraints, and the challenge of handling multiple distinct sub-tasks. To address these challenges, we propose HyperTree Planning (HTP), a novel reasoning paradigm that constructs hypertree-structured planning outlines for effective planning. The hypertree structure enables LLMs to engage in hierarchical thinking by flexibly employing the divide-and-conquer strategy, effectively breaking down intricate reasoning steps, accommodating diverse constraints, and managing multiple distinct sub-tasks in a well-organized manner. We further introduce an autonomous planning framework that completes the planning process by iteratively refining and expanding the hypertree-structured planning outlines. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of HTP, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on the TravelPlanner benchmark with Gemini-1.5-Pro, resulting in a 3.6 times performance improvement over o1-preview.

      Pruning is a widely used technique to compress large language models (LLMs) by removing unimportant weights, but it often suffers from significant performance degradation - especially under semi-structured sparsity constraints. Existing pruning methods primarily focus on estimating the importance of individual weights, which limits their ability to preserve critical capabilities of the model. In this work, we propose a new perspective: rather than merely selecting which weights to prune, we first redistribute parameter importance to make the model inherently more amenable to pruning. By minimizing the information entropy of normalized importance scores, our approach concentrates importance onto a smaller subset of weights, thereby enhancing pruning robustness. We instantiate this idea through DenoiseRotator, which applies learnable orthogonal transformations to the model's weight matrices. Our method is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated with existing pruning techniques such as Magnitude, SparseGPT, and Wanda. Evaluated on LLaMA3, Qwen2.5, and Mistral models under 50% unstructured and 2:4 semi-structured sparsity, DenoiseRotator consistently improves perplexity and zero-shot accuracy. For instance, on LLaMA3-70B pruned with SparseGPT at 2:4 semi-structured sparsity, DenoiseRotator reduces the perplexity gap to the dense model by 58%, narrowing the degradation from 8.1 to 3.4 points.

      Drug-drug interaction (DDI) prediction is critical for treatment safety. While large language models (LLMs) show promise in pharmaceutical tasks, their effectiveness in DDI prediction remains challenging. Inspired by the well-established clinical practice where physicians routinely reference similar historical cases to guide their decisions through case-based reasoning (CBR), we propose CBR-DDI, a novel framework that distills pharmacological principles from historical cases to improve LLM reasoning for DDI tasks. CBR-DDI constructs a knowledge repository by leveraging LLMs to extract pharmacological insights and graph neural networks (GNNs) to model drug associations. A hybrid retrieval mechanism and dual-layer knowledge-enhanced prompting allow LLMs to effectively retrieve and reuse relevant cases. We further introduce a representative sampling strategy for dynamic case refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CBR-DDI achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a significant 28.7% accuracy improvement over both popular LLMs and CBR baseline, while maintaining high interpretability and flexibility.

However, the rise of large language models (LLMs) brings potential risks of evidence pollution to confuse detectors. This paper explores potential manipulation scenarios including basic pollution, and rephrasing or generating evidence by LLMs. To mitigate the negative impact, we propose three defense strategies from the data and model sides, including machine-generated text detection, a mixture of experts, and parameter updating. Extensive experiments on four malicious social text detection tasks with ten datasets illustrate that evidence pollution significantly compromises detectors, where the generating strategy causes up to a 14.4% performance drop. Meanwhile, the defense strategies could mitigate evidence pollution, but they faced limitations for practical employment. Further analysis illustrates that polluted evidence (i) is of high quality, evaluated by metrics and humans; (ii) would compromise the model calibration, increasing expected calibration error up to 21.6%; and (iii) could be integrated to amplify the negative impact, especially for encoder-based LMs, where the accuracy drops by 21.8%.

In this paper, we propose GuardAgent, the first guardrail agent to protect target agents by dynamically checking whether their actions satisfy given safety guard requests. Specifically, GuardAgent first analyzes the safety guard requests to generate a task plan, and then maps this plan into guardrail code for execution. By performing the code execution, GuardAgent can deterministically follow the safety guard request and safeguard target agents. In both steps, an LLM is utilized as the reasoning component, supplemented by in-context demonstrations retrieved from a memory module storing experiences from previous tasks. In addition, we propose two novel benchmarks: EICU-AC benchmark to assess the access control for healthcare agents and Mind2Web-SC benchmark to evaluate the safety policies for web agents. We show that GuardAgent effectively moderates the violation actions for different types of agents on these two benchmarks with over 98% and 83% guardrail accuracies, respectively.

However, existing methods are often limited to single-floor settings or predefined object categories. To address these limitations, we tackle two key challenges: (1) efficient cross-level planning and (2) zero-shot object-goal navigation (ZS-OGN), where agents must interpret novel object descriptions without prior exposure.

      The reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) has been rapidly advancing in recent years, attracting interest in more fundamental approaches that can reliably enhance their generalizability. This work demonstrates that model complexity control, conveniently implementable by adjusting the initialization rate and weight decay coefficient, improves the scaling law of LLMs consistently over varying model sizes and data sizes. This gain is further illustrated by comparing the benchmark performance of 2.4B models pretrained on 1T tokens with different complexity hyperparameters. Instead of fixing the initialization std, we found that a constant initialization rate (the exponent of std) enables the scaling law to descend faster in both model and data sizes. These results indicate that complexity control is a promising direction for the continual advancement of LLMs.

      Bargaining, a critical aspect of real-world interactions, presents challenges for large language models (LLMs) due to limitations in strategic depth and adaptation to complex human factors. Existing benchmarks often fail to capture this real-world complexity. To address this and enhance LLM capabilities in realistic bargaining, we introduce a comprehensive framework centered on utility-based feedback. Our contributions are threefold: (1) BargainArena, a novel benchmark dataset with six intricate scenarios (e.g., deceptive practices, monopolies) to facilitate diverse strategy modeling; (2) human-aligned, economically-grounded evaluation metrics inspired by utility theory, incorporating agent utility and negotiation power, which implicitly reflect and promote opponent-aware reasoning (OAR); and (3) a structured feedback mechanism enabling LLMs to iteratively refine their bargaining strategies. This mechanism can positively collaborate with in-context learning (ICL) prompts, including those explicitly designed to foster OAR. Experimental results show that LLMs often exhibit negotiation strategies misaligned with human preferences, and that our structured feedback mechanism significantly improves their performance, yielding deeper strategic and opponent-aware reasoning.

      This work presents Pangu Embedded, an efficient Large Language Model (LLM) reasoner developed on Ascend Neural Processing Units (NPUs), featuring flexible fast and slow thinking capabilities. Pangu Embedded addresses the significant computational costs and inference latency challenges prevalent in existing reasoning-optimized LLMs. We propose a two-stage training framework for its construction. In Stage 1, the model is finetuned via an iterative distillation process, incorporating inter-iteration model merging to effectively aggregate complementary knowledge. This is followed by reinforcement learning on Ascend clusters, optimized by a latency-tolerant scheduler that combines stale synchronous parallelism with prioritized data queues. The RL process is guided by a Multi-source Adaptive Reward System (MARS), which generates dynamic, task-specific reward signals using deterministic metrics and lightweight LLM evaluators for mathematics, coding, and general problem-solving tasks. Stage 2 introduces a dual-system framework, endowing Pangu Embedded with a "fast" mode for routine queries and a deeper "slow" mode for complex inference. This framework offers both manual mode switching for user control and an automatic, complexity-aware mode selection mechanism that dynamically allocates computational resources to balance latency and reasoning depth. Experimental results on benchmarks including AIME 2024, GPQA, and LiveCodeBench demonstrate that Pangu Embedded with 7B parameters, outperforms similar-size models like Qwen3-8B and GLM4-9B. It delivers rapid responses and state-of-the-art reasoning quality within a single, unified model architecture, highlighting a promising direction for developing powerful yet practically deployable LLM reasoners.

      This paper presents a novel approach for unified retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems using the recent emerging large language model (LLM) agent concept. Specifically, Agent LLM, which utilizes LLM as fundamental controllers, has become a promising approach to enable the interpretability of RAG tasks, especially for complex reasoning question-answering systems (e.g., multi-hop queries). Nonetheless, previous works mainly focus on solving RAG systems with either single-hop or multi-hop approaches separately, which limits the application of those approaches to real-world applications. In this study, we propose a trainable agent framework called Agent-UniRAG for unified retrieval-augmented LLM systems, which enhances the effectiveness and interpretability of RAG systems. The main idea is to design an LLM agent framework to solve RAG tasks step-by-step based on the complexity of the inputs, simultaneously including single-hop and multi-hop queries in an end-to-end manner. Furthermore, we introduce SynAgent-RAG, a synthetic dataset to enable the proposed agent framework for small open-source LLMs (e.g., Llama-3-8B). The results show comparable performances with closed-source and larger open-source LLMs across various RAG benchmarks. Our source code and dataset are publicly available for further exploitation.

      Process mining aims to discover, monitor and optimize the actual behaviors of real processes. While prior work has mainly focused on extracting procedural action flows from instructional texts, rule flows embedded in business documents remain underexplored. To this end, we introduce a novel annotated Chinese dataset, BPRF, which contains 50 business process documents with 326 explicitly labeled business rules across multiple domains. Each rule is represented as a <Condition, Action> pair, and we annotate logical dependencies between rules (sequential, conditional, or parallel). We also propose ExIde, a framework for automatic business rule extraction and dependency relationship identification using large language models (LLMs). We evaluate ExIde using 12 state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs on the BPRF dataset, benchmarking performance on both rule extraction and dependency classification tasks of current LLMs. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of ExIde in extracting structured business rules and analyzing their interdependencies for current SOTA LLMs, paving the way for more automated and interpretable business process automation.

      Extracting structured labels from radiology reports has been employed to create vision models to simultaneously detect several types of abnormalities. However, existing works focus mainly on the chest region. Few works have been investigated on abdominal radiology reports due to more complex anatomy and a wider range of pathologies in the abdomen. We propose LEAVS (Large language model Extractor for Abdominal Vision Supervision). This labeler can annotate the certainty of presence and the urgency of seven types of abnormalities for nine abdominal organs on CT radiology reports. To ensure broad coverage, we chose abnormalities that encompass most of the finding types from CT reports. Our approach employs a specialized chain-of-thought prompting strategy for a locally-run LLM using sentence extraction and multiple-choice questions in a tree-based decision system. We demonstrate that the LLM can extract several abnormality types across abdominal organs with an average F1 score of 0.89, significantly outperforming competing labelers and humans. Additionally, we show that extraction of urgency labels achieved performance comparable to human annotations. Finally, we demonstrate that the abnormality labels contain valuable information for training a single vision model that classifies several organs as normal or abnormal. We release our code and structured annotations for a public CT dataset containing over 1,000 CT volumes.

      Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising potential in persuasion, but existing works on training LLM persuaders are still preliminary. Notably, while humans are skilled in modeling their opponent's thoughts and opinions proactively and dynamically, current LLMs struggle with such Theory of Mind (ToM) reasoning, resulting in limited diversity and opponent awareness. To address this limitation, we introduce Theory of Mind Augmented Persuader (ToMAP), a novel approach for building more flexible persuader agents by incorporating two theory of mind modules that enhance the persuader's awareness and analysis of the opponent's mental state. Specifically, we begin by prompting the persuader to consider possible objections to the target central claim, and then use a text encoder paired with a trained MLP classifier to predict the opponent's current stance on these counterclaims. Our carefully designed reinforcement learning schema enables the persuader learns how to analyze opponent-related information and utilize it to generate more effective arguments. Experiments show that the ToMAP persuader, while containing only 3B parameters, outperforms much larger baselines, like GPT-4o, with a relative gain of 39.4% across multiple persuadee models and diverse corpora. Notably, ToMAP exhibits complex reasoning chains and reduced repetition during training, which leads to more diverse and effective arguments. The opponent-aware feature of ToMAP also makes it suitable for long conversations and enables it to employ more logical and opponent-aware strategies. These results underscore our method's effectiveness and highlight its potential for developing more persuasive language agents. Code is available at: https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/ToMAP.

      Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) compliance assessment demands dynamic real-time decision-making under complicated regulations and complex human-machine-environment interactions. While large language models (LLMs) hold significant potential for decision intelligence and contextual dialogue, their capacity for domain-specific knowledge in HSE and structured legal reasoning remains underexplored. We introduce HSE-Bench, the first benchmark dataset designed to evaluate the HSE compliance assessment capabilities of LLM. HSE-Bench comprises over 1,000 manually curated questions drawn from regulations, court cases, safety exams, and fieldwork videos, and integrates a reasoning flow based on Issue spotting, rule Recall, rule Application, and rule Conclusion (IRAC) to assess the holistic reasoning pipeline. We conduct extensive evaluations on different prompting strategies and more than 10 LLMs, including foundation models, reasoning models and multimodal vision models. The results show that, although current LLMs achieve good performance, their capabilities largely rely on semantic matching rather than principled reasoning grounded in the underlying HSE compliance context. Moreover, their native reasoning trace lacks the systematic legal reasoning required for rigorous HSE compliance assessment. To alleviate these, we propose a new prompting technique, Reasoning of Expert (RoE), which guides LLMs to simulate the reasoning process of different experts for compliance assessment and reach a more accurate unified decision. We hope our study highlights reasoning gaps in LLMs for HSE compliance and inspires further research on related tasks.

      Large Language Models $($LLMs$)$ solve complex problems using training-free methods like prompt engineering and in-context learning, yet ensuring reasoning correctness remains challenging. While self-correction methods such as self-consistency and self-refinement aim to improve reliability, they often reinforce biases due to the lack of effective feedback mechanisms. Multi-Agent Debate $($MAD$)$ has emerged as an alternative, but we identify two key limitations: bias reinforcement, where debate amplifies model biases instead of correcting them, and lack of perspective diversity, as all agents share the same model and reasoning patterns, limiting true debate effectiveness. To systematically evaluate these issues, we introduce $\textit{MetaNIM Arena}$, a benchmark designed to assess LLMs in adversarial strategic decision-making, where dynamic interactions influence optimal decisions. To overcome MAD's limitations, we propose $\textbf{DReaMAD}$ $($$\textbf{D}$iverse $\textbf{Rea}$soning via $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{A}$gent $\textbf{D}$ebate with Refined Prompt$)$, a novel framework that $(1)$ refines LLM's strategic prior knowledge to improve reasoning quality and $(2)$ promotes diverse viewpoints within a single model by systematically modifying prompts, reducing bias. Empirical results show that $\textbf{DReaMAD}$ significantly improves decision accuracy, reasoning diversity, and bias mitigation across multiple strategic tasks, establishing it as a more effective approach for LLM-based decision-making.

      Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in zero-shot summarization, but often struggle to model document structure and identify salient information in long texts. In this work, we introduce StrucSum, a training-free prompting framework that enhances LLM reasoning through sentence-level graph structures. StrucSum injects structural signals into prompts via three targeted strategies: Neighbor-Aware Prompting (NAP) for local context, Centrality-Aware Prompting (CAP) for importance estimation, and Centrality-Guided Masking (CGM) for efficient input reduction. Experiments on ArXiv, PubMed, and Multi-News demonstrate that StrucSum consistently improves both summary quality and factual consistency over unsupervised baselines and vanilla prompting. Notably, on ArXiv, it boosts FactCC and SummaC by 19.2 and 9.7 points, indicating stronger alignment between summaries and source content. These findings suggest that structure-aware prompting is a simple yet effective approach for zero-shot extractive summarization with LLMs, without any training or task-specific tuning.

      Traditional recommender systems usually take the user-platform paradigm, where users are directly exposed under the control of the platform's recommendation algorithms. However, the defect of recommendation algorithms may put users in very vulnerable positions under this paradigm. First, many sophisticated models are often designed with commercial objectives in mind, focusing on the platform's benefits, which may hinder their ability to protect and capture users' true interests. Second, these models are typically optimized using data from all users, which may overlook individual user's preferences. Due to these shortcomings, users may experience several disadvantages under the traditional user-platform direct exposure paradigm, such as lack of control over the recommender system, potential manipulation by the platform, echo chamber effects, or lack of personalization for less active users due to the dominance of active users during collaborative learning. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a new paradigm to protect user interests and alleviate these issues. Recently, some researchers have introduced LLM agents to simulate user behaviors, these approaches primarily aim to optimize platform-side performance, leaving core issues in recommender systems unresolved. To address these limitations, we propose a new user-agent-platform paradigm, where agent serves as the protective shield between user and recommender system that enables indirect exposure.

      Large language models (LLMs) typically generate identical or similar responses for all users given the same prompt, posing serious safety risks in high-stakes applications where user vulnerabilities differ widely. Existing safety evaluations primarily rely on context-independent metrics - such as factuality, bias, or toxicity - overlooking the fact that the same response may carry divergent risks depending on the user's background or condition. We introduce personalized safety to fill this gap and present PENGUIN - a benchmark comprising 14,000 scenarios across seven sensitive domains with both context-rich and context-free variants. Evaluating six leading LLMs, we demonstrate that personalized user information significantly improves safety scores by 43.2%, confirming the effectiveness of personalization in safety alignment. However, not all context attributes contribute equally to safety enhancement. To address this, we develop RAISE - a training-free, two-stage agent framework that strategically acquires user-specific background. RAISE improves safety scores by up to 31.6% over six vanilla LLMs, while maintaining a low interaction cost of just 2.7 user queries on average. Our findings highlight the importance of selective information gathering in safety-critical domains and offer a practical solution for personalizing LLM responses without model retraining. This work establishes a foundation for safety research that adapts to individual user contexts rather than assuming a universal harm standard.

      Penetration testing is a critical technique for identifying security vulnerabilities, traditionally performed manually by skilled security specialists. This complex process involves gathering information about the target system, identifying entry points, exploiting the system, and reporting findings. Despite its effectiveness, manual penetration testing is time-consuming and expensive, often requiring significant expertise and resources that many organizations cannot afford. While automated penetration testing methods have been proposed, they often fall short in real-world applications due to limitations in flexibility, adaptability, and implementation. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for enhancing penetration testing through increased intelligence and automation. However, current LLM-based approaches still face significant challenges, including limited penetration testing knowledge and a lack of comprehensive automation capabilities. To address these gaps, we propose PentestAgent, a novel LLM-based automated penetration testing framework that leverages the power of LLMs and various LLM-based techniques like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance penetration testing knowledge and automate various tasks. Our framework leverages multi-agent collaboration to automate intelligence gathering, vulnerability analysis, and exploitation stages, reducing manual intervention. We evaluate PentestAgent using a comprehensive benchmark, demonstrating superior performance in task completion and overall efficiency.

      Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for real-world tasks that fundamentally involve data manipulation. A core requirement across these tasks is the ability to perform structural reasoning--that is, to understand and reason about data relationships. For example, customer requests require a temporal ordering, which can be represented by data structures such as queues. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on high-level, application-driven evaluations without isolating this fundamental capability. To address this gap, we introduce DSR-Bench, a novel benchmark evaluating LLMs' structural reasoning capabilities through data structures, which provide interpretable representations of data relationships. DSR-Bench includes 20 data structures, 35 operations, and 4,140 problem instances, organized hierarchically for fine-grained analysis of reasoning limitations. Our evaluation pipeline is fully automated and deterministic, eliminating subjective human or model-based judgments. Its synthetic nature also ensures scalability and minimizes data contamination risks. We benchmark nine state-of-the-art LLMs. Our analysis shows that instruction-tuned models struggle with basic multi-attribute and multi-hop reasoning. Furthermore, while reasoning-oriented models perform better, they remain fragile on complex and hybrid structures, with the best model achieving an average score of only 47% on the challenge subset. Crucially, models often perform poorly on multi-dimensional data and natural language task descriptions, highlighting a critical gap for real-world deployment.

      Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), significantly enhancing their reasoning abilities in domains such as mathematics and code generation. A crucial factor influencing RL fine-tuning success is the training curriculum: the order in which training problems are presented. While random curricula serve as common baselines, they remain suboptimal; manually designed curricula often rely heavily on heuristics, and online filtering methods can be computationally prohibitive. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Evolving Curriculum (SEC), an automatic curriculum learning method that learns a curriculum policy concurrently with the RL fine-tuning process. Our approach formulates curriculum selection as a non-stationary Multi-Armed Bandit problem, treating each problem category (e.g., difficulty level or problem type) as an individual arm. We leverage the absolute advantage from policy gradient methods as a proxy measure for immediate learning gain. At each training step, the curriculum policy selects categories to maximize this reward signal and is updated using the TD(0) method. Across three distinct reasoning domains: planning, inductive reasoning, and mathematics, our experiments demonstrate that SEC significantly improves models' reasoning capabilities, enabling better generalization to harder, out-of-distribution test problems. Additionally, our approach achieves better skill balance when fine-tuning simultaneously on multiple reasoning domains. These findings highlight SEC as a promising strategy for RL fine-tuning of LLMs.

      Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various tasks but face deployment challenges due to their massive computational demands. While post-training pruning methods like SparseGPT and Wanda can effectively reduce the model size, but struggle to maintain model performance at high sparsity levels, limiting their utility for downstream tasks. Existing fine-tuning methods, such as full fine-tuning and LoRA, fail to preserve sparsity as they require updating the whole dense metrics, not well-suited for sparse LLMs. In this paper, we propose Sparsity Evolution Fine-Tuning (SEFT), a novel method designed specifically for sparse LLMs. SEFT dynamically evolves the sparse topology of pruned models during fine-tuning, while preserving the overall sparsity throughout the process. The strengths of SEFT lie in its ability to perform task-specific adaptation through a weight drop-and-grow strategy, enabling the pruned model to self-adapt its sparse connectivity pattern based on the target dataset. Furthermore, a sensitivity-driven pruning criterion is employed to ensure that the desired sparsity level is consistently maintained throughout fine-tuning. Our experiments on various LLMs, including LLaMA families, DeepSeek, and Mistral, across a diverse set of benchmarks demonstrate that SEFT achieves stronger performance while offering superior memory and time efficiency compared to existing baselines.

In this work, we introduce CoCo-CoLa (Correct Concept - Correct Language), a novel metric to evaluate language adherence in multilingual LLMs. Using fine-tuning experiments on a closed-book QA task across seven languages, we analyze how training in one language affects others' performance. Our findings reveal that multilingual models share task knowledge across languages but exhibit biases in the selection of output language. We identify language-specific layers, showing that final layers play a crucial role in determining output language. Accordingly, we propose a partial training strategy that selectively fine-tunes key layers, improving language adherence while significantly reducing computational cost. Our method achieves comparable or superior performance to full fine-tuning, particularly for low-resource languages, offering a more efficient multilingual adaptation.

      Knowledge graph completion aims to address the gaps of knowledge bases by adding new triples that represent facts. The complexity of this task depends on how many parts of a triple are already known. Instance completion involves predicting the relation-tail pair when only the head is given (h, ?, ?). Notably, modern knowledge bases often contain entity descriptions and types, which can provide valuable context for inferring missing facts. By leveraging these textual descriptions and the ability of large language models to extract facts from them and recognize patterns within the knowledge graph schema, we propose an LLM-powered, end-to-end instance completion approach.

      Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become the most effective post-training approach for improving the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). In practice, because of the high demands on latency and memory, it is particularly challenging to develop an efficient RL framework that reliably manages policy models with hundreds to thousands of billions of parameters. In this paper, we present LlamaRL, a fully distributed, asynchronous RL framework optimized for efficient training of large-scale LLMs with various model sizes (8B, 70B, and 405B parameters) on GPU clusters ranging from a handful to thousands of devices. LlamaRL introduces a streamlined, single-controller architecture built entirely on native PyTorch, enabling modularity, ease of use, and seamless scalability to thousands of GPUs. We also provide a theoretical analysis of LlamaRL's efficiency, including a formal proof that its asynchronous design leads to strict RL speed-up. Empirically, by leveraging best practices such as colocated model offloading, asynchronous off-policy training, and distributed direct memory access for weight synchronization, LlamaRL achieves significant efficiency gains -- up to 10.7x speed-up compared to DeepSpeed-Chat-like systems on a 405B-parameter policy model. Furthermore, the efficiency advantage continues to grow with increasing model scale, demonstrating the framework's suitability for future large-scale RL training.

      Code auditing is the process of reviewing code with the aim of identifying bugs. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities for this task without requiring compilation, while also supporting user-friendly customization. However, auditing a code repository with LLMs poses significant challenges: limited context windows and hallucinations can degrade the quality of bug reports, and analyzing large-scale repositories incurs substantial time and token costs, hindering efficiency and scalability. This work introduces an LLM-based agent, RepoAudit, designed to perform autonomous repository-level code auditing. Equipped with agent memory, RepoAudit explores the codebase on demand by analyzing data-flow facts along feasible program paths within individual functions. It further incorporates a validator module to mitigate hallucinations by verifying data-flow facts and checking the satisfiability of path conditions associated with potential bugs, thereby reducing false positives. RepoAudit detects 40 true bugs across 15 real-world benchmark projects with a precision of 78.43%, requiring on average only 0.44 hours and $2.54 per project. Also, it detects 185 new bugs in high-profile projects, among which 174 have been confirmed or fixed. We have open-sourced RepoAudit at https://github.com/PurCL/RepoAudit.

      Large Language Model (LLM) agents show considerable promise for automating complex tasks using contextual reasoning; however, interactions involving multiple agents and the system's susceptibility to prompt injection and other forms of context manipulation introduce new vulnerabilities related to privacy leakage and system exploitation. This position paper argues that the well-established design principles in information security, which are commonly referred to as security principles, should be employed when deploying LLM agents at scale. Design principles such as defense-in-depth, least privilege, complete mediation, and psychological acceptability have helped guide the design of mechanisms for securing information systems over the last five decades, and we argue that their explicit and conscientious adoption will help secure agentic systems. To illustrate this approach, we introduce AgentSandbox, a conceptual framework embedding these security principles to provide safeguards throughout an agent's life-cycle. We evaluate with state-of-the-art LLMs along three dimensions: benign utility, attack utility, and attack success rate. AgentSandbox maintains high utility for its intended functions under both benign and adversarial evaluations while substantially mitigating privacy risks. By embedding secure design principles as foundational elements within emerging LLM agent protocols, we aim to promote trustworthy agent ecosystems aligned with user privacy expectations and evolving regulatory requirements.

      This study presents BanStereoSet, a dataset designed to evaluate stereotypical social biases in multilingual LLMs for the Bangla language. In an effort to extend the focus of bias research beyond English-centric datasets, we have localized the content from the StereoSet, IndiBias, and Kamruzzaman et. al.'s datasets, producing a resource tailored to capture biases prevalent within the Bangla-speaking community. Our BanStereoSet dataset consists of 1,194 sentences spanning 9 categories of bias: race, profession, gender, ageism, beauty, beauty in profession, region, caste, and religion. This dataset not only serves as a crucial tool for measuring bias in multilingual LLMs but also facilitates the exploration of stereotypical bias across different social categories, potentially guiding the development of more equitable language technologies in Bangladeshi contexts. Our analysis of several language models using this dataset indicates significant biases, reinforcing the necessity for culturally and linguistically adapted datasets to develop more equitable language technologies.

      Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing, with frameworks like Chatbot Arena providing pioneering platforms for evaluating these models. By facilitating millions of pairwise comparisons based on human judgments, Chatbot Arena has become a cornerstone in LLM evaluation, offering rich datasets for ranking models in open-ended conversational tasks. Building upon this foundation, we propose a statistical framework that incorporates key advancements to address specific challenges in pairwise comparison analysis. First, we introduce a factored tie model that enhances the ability to handle ties -- an integral aspect of human-judged comparisons -- significantly improving the model's fit to observed data. Second, we extend the framework to model covariance between competitors, enabling deeper insights into performance relationships and facilitating intuitive groupings into performance tiers. Third, we resolve optimization challenges arising from parameter non-uniqueness by introducing novel constraints, ensuring stable and interpretable parameter estimation. Through rigorous evaluation and extensive experimentation, our framework demonstrates substantial improvements over existing methods in modeling pairwise comparison data. To support reproducibility and practical adoption, we release leaderbot, an open-source Python package implementing our models and analyses.

      Group conversations are valuable for second language (L2) learners as they provide opportunities to practice listening and speaking, exercise complex turn-taking skills, and experience group social dynamics in a target language. However, most existing Augmented Reality (AR)-based conversational learning tools focus on dyadic interactions rather than group dialogues. Although research has shown that AR can help reduce speaking anxiety and create a comfortable space for practicing speaking skills in dyadic scenarios, especially with Large Language Model (LLM)-based conversational agents, the potential for group language practice using these technologies remains largely unexplored. We introduce ConversAR, a gpt-4o powered AR application, that enables L2 learners to practice contextualized group conversations. Our system features two embodied LLM agents with vision-based scene understanding and live captions. In a system evaluation with 10 participants, users reported reduced speaking anxiety and increased learner autonomy compared to perceptions of in-person practice methods with other learners.

      The recent rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) highlights the critical need for benchmarking their fairness. Conventional fairness metrics, which focus on discrete accuracy-based evaluations (i.e., prediction correctness), fail to capture the implicit impact of model uncertainty (e.g., higher model confidence about one group over another despite similar accuracy). To address this limitation, we propose an uncertainty-aware fairness metric, UCerF, to enable a fine-grained evaluation of model fairness that is more reflective of the internal bias in model decisions compared to conventional fairness measures. Furthermore, observing data size, diversity, and clarity issues in current datasets, we introduce a new gender-occupation fairness evaluation dataset with 31,756 samples for co-reference resolution, offering a more diverse and suitable dataset for evaluating modern LLMs. We establish a benchmark, using our metric and dataset, and apply it to evaluate the behavior of ten open-source LLMs. For example, Mistral-7B exhibits suboptimal fairness due to high confidence in incorrect predictions, a detail overlooked by Equalized Odds but captured by UCerF. Overall, our proposed LLM benchmark, which evaluates fairness with uncertainty awareness, paves the way for developing more transparent and accountable AI systems.

This paper introduces PolicyPulse, an LLM-powered interactive system that synthesizes public experiences from online community discussions to help policy researchers author memos and briefs, leveraging curated real-world anecdotes. Given a specific topic (e.g., "Climate Change"), PolicyPulse returns an organized list of themes (e.g., "Biodiversity Loss" or "Carbon Pricing"), supporting each theme with relevant quotes from real-life anecdotes. We compared PolicyPulse outputs to authoritative policy reports. Additionally, we asked 11 policy researchers across multiple institutions in the Northeastern U.S to compare using PolicyPulse with their expert approach. We found that PolicyPulse's themes aligned with authoritative reports and helped spark research by analyzing existing data, gathering diverse experiences, revealing unexpected themes, and informing survey or interview design.

      Despite recent advances in large language models (LLMs) for materials science, there is a lack of benchmarks for evaluating their domain-specific knowledge and complex reasoning abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce MSQA, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark of 1,757 graduate-level materials science questions in two formats: detailed explanatory responses and binary True/False assessments. MSQA distinctively challenges LLMs by requiring both precise factual knowledge and multi-step reasoning across seven materials science sub-fields, such as structure-property relationships, synthesis processes, and computational modeling. Through experiments with 10 state-of-the-art LLMs, we identify significant gaps in current LLM performance. While API-based proprietary LLMs achieve up to 84.5% accuracy, open-source (OSS) LLMs peak around 60.5%, and domain-specific LLMs often underperform significantly due to overfitting and distributional shifts. MSQA represents the first benchmark to jointly evaluate the factual and reasoning capabilities of LLMs crucial for LLMs in advanced materials science.

      Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities but face challenges from hallucinations, which typically arise from insufficient knowledge or context. While instructing LLMs to acknowledge knowledge limitations by responding with "I don't know" appears promising, we find that models consistently struggle with admitting knowledge gaps. This challenge may originate from current instruction datasets that emphasise answer generation over knowledge boundary awareness. To address this limitation, we introduce Uncertainty-and-Sensitivity-Aware Tuning (US-Tuning), a novel two-stage approach for contextual question answering (QA). The first stage enhances LLMs' ability to recognise their knowledge boundaries, while the second stage reinforces instruction adherence through carefully designed causal prompts. Our experimental results demonstrate that US-Tuning not only significantly reduces incorrect answers in contextual QA but also improves models' faithfulness to their parametric knowledge, mitigating hallucinations in general QA tasks. Our fine-tuned Llama2-7B model achieves up to a 34.7% improvement in handling out-of-knowledge questions and outperforms GPT-4 by 4.2% in overall performance.

      As large language models (LLMs) become widely used, their environmental impact$\unicode{x2014}$especially carbon emissions$\unicode{x2014}$has attracted more attention. Prior studies focus on compute-related carbon emissions. In this paper, we find that storage is another key contributor. LLM caching, which saves and reuses KV caches for repeated context, reduces operational carbon by avoiding redundant computation. However, this benefit comes at the cost of embodied carbon from high-capacity, high-speed SSDs. As LLMs scale, the embodied carbon of storage grows significantly. To address this tradeoff, we present EmbAdvisor, a carbon-aware caching framework that selects the optimal cache size for LLM serving. EmbAdvisor profiles different LLM tasks and uses an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) solver to select cache sizes that meet SLOs while minimizing total carbon emissions. Overall, EmbAdvisor reduces the average carbon emissions of a Llama-3 70B model by 9.5% under various carbon intensities compared to a non-adaptive cache scenario, and can save up to 31.2% when the carbon intensity is low.

      Automatic code generation has gained significant momentum with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4. Although many studies focus on improving the effectiveness of LLMs for code generation, very limited work tries to understand the generated code's characteristics and leverage that to improve failed cases. In this paper, as the most straightforward characteristic of code, we investigate the relationship between code complexity and the success of LLM generated code. Using a large set of standard complexity metrics, we first conduct an empirical analysis to explore their correlation with LLM's performance on code generation (i.e., Pass@1). Using logistic regression models, we identify which complexity metrics are most predictive of code correctness. Building on these findings, we propose an iterative feedback method, where LLMs are prompted to generate correct code based on complexity metrics from previous failed outputs. We validate our approach across multiple benchmarks (i.e., HumanEval, MBPP, LeetCode, and BigCodeBench) and various LLMs (i.e., GPT-4o, GPT-3.5 Turbo, Llama 3.1, and GPT-o3 mini), comparing the results with two baseline methods: (a) zero-shot generation, and (b) iterative execution-based feedback without our code complexity insights. Experiment results show that our approach makes notable improvements, particularly with a smaller LLM (GPT3.5 Turbo), where, e.g., Pass@1 increased by 35.71% compared to the baseline's improvement of 12.5% on the HumanEval dataset. The study expands experiments to BigCodeBench and integrates the method with the Reflexion code generation agent, leading to Pass@1 improvements of 20% (GPT-4o) and 23.07% (GPT-o3 mini). The results highlight that complexity-aware feedback enhances both direct LLM prompting and agent-based workflows.

      Recent studies show that LLMs possess different skills and specialize in different tasks. In fact, we observe that their varied performance occur in several levels of granularity. For example, in the code optimization task, code LLMs excel at different optimization categories and no one dominates others. This observation prompts the question of how one leverages multiple LLM agents to solve a coding problem without knowing their complementary strengths a priori. We argue that a team of agents can learn from each other's successes and failures so as to improve their own performance. Thus, a lesson is the knowledge produced by an agent and passed on to other agents in the collective solution process. We propose a lesson-based collaboration framework, design the lesson solicitation--banking--selection mechanism, and demonstrate that a team of small LLMs with lessons learned can outperform a much larger LLM and other multi-LLM collaboration methods.

      The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled the development of multi-agent systems where multiple LLM-based agents collaborate on complex tasks. However, existing systems often rely on centralized coordination, leading to scalability bottlenecks, reduced adaptability, and single points of failure. Privacy and proprietary knowledge concerns further hinder cross-organizational collaboration, resulting in siloed expertise. We propose AgentNet, a decentralized, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based framework that enables LLM-based agents to specialize, evolve, and collaborate autonomously in a dynamically structured Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). Unlike prior approaches with static roles or centralized control, AgentNet allows agents to adjust connectivity and route tasks based on local expertise and context. AgentNet introduces three key innovations: (1) a fully decentralized coordination mechanism that eliminates the need for a central orchestrator, enhancing robustness and emergent intelligence; (2) dynamic agent graph topology that adapts in real time to task demands, ensuring scalability and resilience; and (3) a retrieval-based memory system for agents that supports continual skill refinement and specialization. By minimizing centralized control and data exchange, AgentNet enables fault-tolerant, privacy-preserving collaboration across organizations. Experiments show that AgentNet achieves higher task accuracy than both single-agent and centralized multi-agent baselines.

      Robust alignment is vital for safely deploying large language models (LLMs). Existing techniques are either reward-based -- training a reward model on preference pairs and optimizing with reinforcement learning (RL) -- or reward-free -- directly fine-tuning on ranked outputs. Recent research shows that well-tuned reward-based pipelines remain the most robust, and single-response demonstrations can outperform pairwise preference data. However, two key challenges remain: (i) imbalanced safety datasets that over-represent common hazards while neglecting long-tail threats; and (ii) static reward models that ignore task difficulty, limiting optimization efficiency and attainable gains. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{DR-IRL}, which dynamically adjusts rewards through inverse reinforcement learning. We first construct a balanced safety dataset of seven harmful categories using Chain-of-Draft (CoD) template prompts, which reduce token usage and generation time compared to Chain-of-Thought (CoT). We then train category-specific reward models on this dataset via IRL. Finally, to align the LLM, we introduce \textbf{GRPO-S} (Group Relative Policy Optimization--Scaling), a variant of GRPO that scales the reward during optimization to task difficulty -- data-level hardness measured by CLIP similarity and model-level responsiveness measured by reward gaps. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks and LLMs demonstrate that DR-IRL outperforms all baselines in safety alignment while maintaining usefulness.

      Tool use has turned large language models (LLMs) into powerful agents that can perform complex multi-step tasks by dynamically utilising external software components. However, these tools must be implemented in advance by human developers, hindering the applicability of LLM agents in domains demanding large numbers of highly specialised tools, like in life sciences and medicine. Motivated by the growing trend of scientific studies accompanied by public code repositories, we propose ToolMaker, an agentic framework that autonomously transforms papers with code into LLM-compatible tools. Given a GitHub URL and short task description, ToolMaker autonomously installs dependencies and generates code to perform the task, using a closed-loop self-correction mechanism for debugging. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a benchmark comprising 15 complex computational tasks spanning various domains with over 100 unit tests to assess correctness and robustness. Our method correctly implements 80% of the tasks, substantially outperforming current state-of-the-art software engineering agents. ToolMaker therefore is a step towards fully autonomous agent-based scientific workflows. Our code and benchmark are publicly available at https://github.com/KatherLab/ToolMaker.

      With the increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) in software engineering, the Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning paradigm has become an essential approach for automated code repair. However, the explicit multi-step reasoning in CoT leads to substantial increases in token consumption, reducing inference efficiency and raising computational costs, especially for complex code repair tasks. Most prior research has focused on improving the correctness of code repair while largely overlooking the resource efficiency of the reasoning process itself. To address this challenge, this paper proposes three targeted optimization strategies: Context Awareness, Responsibility Tuning, and Cost Sensitive. Context Awareness guides the model to focus on key contextual information, Responsibility Tuning refines the structure of the reasoning process through clearer role and responsibility assignment, and Cost Sensitive incorporates resource-awareness to suppress unnecessary token generation during inference. Experiments across diverse code repair scenarios demonstrate that these methods can significantly reduce token consumption in CoT-based reasoning without compromising repair quality. This work provides novel insights and methodological guidance for enhancing the efficiency of LLM-driven code repair tasks in software engineering.

      Large Language Models are widely used for content moderation but often misclassify benign comments as toxic, leading to over-sensitivity. While previous research attributes this issue primarily to the presence of offensive terms, we reveal a potential cause beyond token level: LLMs exhibit systematic topic biases in their implicit associations. Inspired by cognitive psychology's implicit association tests, we introduce Topic Association Analysis, a semantic-level approach to quantify how LLMs associate certain topics with toxicity. By prompting LLMs to generate free-form scenario imagination for misclassified benign comments and analyzing their topic amplification levels, we find that more advanced models (e.g., GPT-4 Turbo) demonstrate stronger topic stereotype despite lower overall false positive rates. These biases suggest that LLMs do not merely react to explicit, offensive language but rely on learned topic associations, shaping their moderation decisions. Our findings highlight the need for refinement beyond keyword-based filtering, providing insights into the underlying mechanisms driving LLM over-sensitivity.

      Vision language models (VLMs) typically pair a modestly sized vision encoder with a large language model (LLM), e.g., Llama-70B, making the decoder the primary computational burden during training. To reduce costs, a potential promising strategy is to first train the vision encoder using a small language model before transferring it to the large one. We construct small "surrogate models" that share the same embedding space and representation language as the large target LLM by directly inheriting its shallow layers. Vision encoders trained on the surrogate can then be directly transferred to the larger model, a process we call zero-shot grafting -- when plugged directly into the full-size target LLM, the grafted pair surpasses the encoder-surrogate pair and, on some benchmarks, even performs on par with full decoder training with the target LLM. Furthermore, our surrogate training approach reduces overall VLM training costs by ~45% when using Llama-70B as the decoder.

      The widespread success of large language models (LLMs) on NLP benchmarks has been accompanied by concerns that LLMs function primarily as stochastic parrots that reproduce texts similar to what they saw during pre-training, often erroneously. But what is the nature of their errors, and do these errors exhibit any regularities? In this work, we examine irrelevant context hallucinations, in which models integrate misleading contextual cues into their predictions. Through behavioral analysis, we show that these errors result from a structured yet flawed mechanism that we term class-based (mis)generalization, in which models combine abstract class cues with features extracted from the query or context to derive answers. Furthermore, mechanistic interpretability experiments on Llama-3, Mistral, and Pythia across 39 factual recall relation types reveal that this behavior is reflected in the model's internal computations: (i) abstract class representations are constructed in lower layers before being refined into specific answers in higher layers, (ii) feature selection is governed by two competing circuits -- one prioritizing direct query-based reasoning, the other incorporating contextual cues -- whose relative influences determine the final output. Our findings provide a more nuanced perspective on the stochastic parrot argument: through form-based training, LLMs can exhibit generalization leveraging abstractions, albeit in unreliable ways based on contextual cues -- what we term stochastic chameleons.

      Diffusion-based large language models (Diffusion LLMs) have shown promise for non-autoregressive text generation with parallel decoding capabilities. However, the practical inference speed of open-sourced Diffusion LLMs often lags behind autoregressive models due to the lack of Key-Value (KV) Cache and quality degradation when decoding multiple tokens simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel block-wise approximate KV Cache mechanism tailored for bidirectional diffusion models, enabling cache reuse with negligible performance drop. Additionally, we identify the root cause of generation quality degradation in parallel decoding as the disruption of token dependencies under the conditional independence assumption. To address this, we propose a confidence-aware parallel decoding strategy that selectively decodes tokens exceeding a confidence threshold, mitigating dependency violations and maintaining generation quality. Experimental results on LLaDA and Dream models across multiple LLM benchmarks demonstrate up to \textbf{27.6$\times$ throughput} improvement with minimal accuracy loss, closing the performance gap with autoregressive models and paving the way for practical deployment of Diffusion LLMs.
