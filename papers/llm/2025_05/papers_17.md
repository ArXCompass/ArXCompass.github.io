      Quantization can accelerate large language model (LLM) inference. Going beyond INT8 quantization, the research community is actively exploring even lower precision, such as INT4. Nonetheless, state-of-the-art INT4 quantization techniques only accelerate low-batch, edge LLM inference, failing to deliver performance gains in large-batch, cloud-based LLM serving. We uncover a critical issue: existing INT4 quantization methods suffer from significant runtime overhead (20-90%) when dequantizing either weights or partial sums on GPUs. To address this challenge, we introduce QoQ, a W4A8KV4 quantization algorithm with 4-bit weight, 8-bit activation, and 4-bit KV cache. QoQ stands for quattuor-octo-quattuor, which represents 4-8-4 in Latin. QoQ is implemented by the QServe inference library that achieves measured speedup. The key insight driving QServe is that the efficiency of LLM serving on GPUs is critically influenced by operations on low-throughput CUDA cores. Building upon this insight, in QoQ algorithm, we introduce progressive quantization that can allow low dequantization overhead in W4A8 GEMM. Additionally, we develop SmoothAttention to effectively mitigate the accuracy degradation incurred by 4-bit KV quantization. In the QServe system, we perform compute-aware weight reordering and take advantage of register-level parallelism to reduce dequantization latency. We also make fused attention memory-bound, harnessing the performance gain brought by KV4 quantization. As a result, QServe improves the maximum achievable serving throughput of Llama-3-8B by 1.2x on A100, 1.4x on L40S; and Qwen1.5-72B by 2.4x on A100, 3.5x on L40S, compared to TensorRT-LLM. Remarkably, QServe on L40S GPU can achieve even higher throughput than TensorRT-LLM on A100. Thus, QServe effectively reduces the dollar cost of LLM serving by 3x.

      The increasing complexity and scale of the Internet of Things (IoT) have made security a critical concern. This paper presents a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based framework for comprehensive threat detection and prevention in IoT environments. The system integrates lightweight LLMs fine-tuned on IoT-specific datasets (IoT-23, TON_IoT) for real-time anomaly detection and automated, context-aware mitigation strategies optimized for resource-constrained devices. A modular Docker-based deployment enables scalable and reproducible evaluation across diverse network conditions. Experimental results in simulated IoT environments demonstrate significant improvements in detection accuracy, response latency, and resource efficiency over traditional security methods. The proposed framework highlights the potential of LLM-driven, autonomous security solutions for future IoT ecosystems.

      Large language models (LLMs) play a key role in generating evidence-based and stylistic counter-arguments, yet their effectiveness in real-world applications has been underexplored. Previous research often neglects the balance between evidentiality and style, which are crucial for persuasive arguments. To address this, we evaluated the effectiveness of stylized evidence-based counter-argument generation in Counterfire, a new dataset of 38,000 counter-arguments generated by revising counter-arguments to Reddit's ChangeMyView community to follow different discursive styles. We evaluated generic and stylized counter-arguments from basic and fine-tuned models such as GPT-3.5, PaLM-2, and Koala-13B, as well as newer models (GPT-4o, Claude Haiku, LLaMA-3.1) focusing on rhetorical quality and persuasiveness. Our findings reveal that humans prefer stylized counter-arguments over the original outputs, with GPT-3.5 Turbo performing well, though still not reaching human standards of rhetorical quality nor persuasiveness. Additionally, our work created a novel argument triplets dataset for studying style control, with human preference labels that provide insights into the tradeoffs between evidence integration and argument quality.

      Many methods for improving Large Language Model (LLM) agents for sequential decision-making tasks depend on task-specific knowledge engineering--such as prompt tuning, curated in-context examples, or customized observation and action spaces. Using these approaches, agent performance improves with the quality or amount of knowledge engineering invested. Instead, we investigate how LLM agents can automatically improve their performance by learning in-context from their own successful experiences on similar tasks. Rather than relying on task-specific knowledge engineering, we focus on constructing and refining a database of self-generated examples. We demonstrate that even a naive accumulation of successful trajectories across training tasks boosts test performance on three benchmarks: ALFWorld (73% to 89%), Wordcraft (55% to 64%), and InterCode-SQL (75% to 79%)--matching the performance the initial agent achieves if allowed two to three attempts per task. We then introduce two extensions: (1) database-level selection through population-based training to identify high-performing example collections, and (2) exemplar-level selection that retains individual trajectories based on their empirical utility as in-context examples. These extensions further enhance performance, achieving 91% on ALFWorld--matching more complex approaches that employ task-specific components and prompts. Our results demonstrate that automatic trajectory database construction offers a compelling alternative to labor-intensive knowledge engineering.

      Medical research faces well-documented challenges in translating novel treatments into clinical practice. Publishing incentives encourage researchers to present "positive" findings, even when empirical results are equivocal. Consequently, it is well-documented that authors often spin study results, especially in article abstracts. Such spin can influence clinician interpretation of evidence and may affect patient care decisions. In this study, we ask whether the interpretation of trial results offered by Large Language Models (LLMs) is similarly affected by spin. This is important since LLMs are increasingly being used to trawl through and synthesize published medical evidence. We evaluated 22 LLMs and found that they are across the board more susceptible to spin than humans. They might also propagate spin into their outputs: We find evidence, e.g., that LLMs implicitly incorporate spin into plain language summaries that they generate. We also find, however, that LLMs are generally capable of recognizing spin, and can be prompted in a way to mitigate spin's impact on LLM outputs.

      The emergent capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have sparked interest in assessing their ability to simulate human opinions in a variety of contexts, potentially serving as surrogates for human subjects in opinion surveys. However, previous evaluations of this capability have depended heavily on costly, domain-specific human survey data, and mixed empirical results about LLM effectiveness create uncertainty for managers about whether investing in this technology is justified in early-stage research. To address these challenges, we introduce a series of quality checks to support early-stage deliberation about the viability of using LLMs for simulating human opinions. These checks emphasize logical constraints, model stability, and alignment with stakeholder expectations of model outputs, thereby reducing dependence on human-generated data in the initial stages of evaluation. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed quality control tests in the context of AI-assisted content moderation, an application that both advocates and critics of LLMs' capabilities to simulate human opinion see as a desirable potential use case. None of the tested models passed all quality control checks, revealing several failure modes. We conclude by discussing implications of these failure modes and recommend how organizations can utilize our proposed tests for prompt engineering and in their risk management practices when considering the use of LLMs for opinion simulation. We make our crowdsourced dataset of claims with human and LLM annotations publicly available for future research.

      Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to novel tasks and enhancing their overall capabilities often requires large, high-quality training datasets. Synthetic data, generated at scale, serves a valuable alternative when real-world data is scarce or difficult to obtain. However, ensuring the quality of synthetic datasets is challenging, as developers must manually inspect and refine numerous samples to identify errors and areas for improvement. This process is time-consuming and requires specialized tools. We introduce NeMo-Inspector, an open-source tool designed to simplify the analysis of synthetic datasets with integrated inference capabilities. We demonstrate its effectiveness through two real-world cases. Analysis and cleaning of the synthetically generated GSM-Plus dataset with NeMo-Inspector led to a significant decrease in low-quality samples from 46.99% to 19.51%. The tool also helped identify and correct generation errors in OpenMath models, improving accuracy by 1.92% on the MATH dataset and by 4.17% on the GSM8K dataset for a Meta-Llama-3-8B model fine-tuned on synthetic data generated from Nemotron-4-340B.
