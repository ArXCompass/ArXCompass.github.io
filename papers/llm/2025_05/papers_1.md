      The emergence of instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) has advanced the field of dialogue systems, enabling both realistic user simulations and robust multi-turn conversational agents. However, existing research often evaluates these components in isolation-either focusing on a single user simulator or a specific system design-limiting the generalisability of insights across architectures and configurations. In this work, we propose clem todd (chat-optimized LLMs for task-oriented dialogue systems development), a flexible framework for systematically evaluating dialogue systems under consistent conditions. clem todd enables detailed benchmarking across combinations of user simulators and dialogue systems, whether existing models from literature or newly developed ones. It supports plug-and-play integration and ensures uniform datasets, evaluation metrics, and computational constraints. We showcase clem todd's flexibility by re-evaluating existing task-oriented dialogue systems within this unified setup and integrating three newly proposed dialogue systems into the same evaluation pipeline. Our results provide actionable insights into how architecture, scale, and prompting strategies affect dialogue performance, offering practical guidance for building efficient and effective conversational AI systems.

      Large Language Model (LLM)-based copilots have shown great potential in Extended Reality (XR) applications. However, the user faces challenges when describing the 3D environments to the copilots due to the complexity of conveying spatial-temporal information through text or speech alone. To address this, we introduce GesPrompt, a multimodal XR interface that combines co-speech gestures with speech, allowing end-users to communicate more naturally and accurately with LLM-based copilots in XR environments. By incorporating gestures, GesPrompt extracts spatial-temporal reference from co-speech gestures, reducing the need for precise textual prompts and minimizing cognitive load for end-users. Our contributions include (1) a workflow to integrate gesture and speech input in the XR environment, (2) a prototype VR system that implements the workflow, and (3) a user study demonstrating its effectiveness in improving user communication in VR environments.

      Data quality has become a key factor in enhancing model performance with the rapid development of large language models (LLMs). Model-driven data filtering has increasingly become a primary approach for acquiring high-quality data. However, it still faces two main challenges: (1) the lack of an efficient data verification strategy makes it difficult to provide timely feedback on data quality; and (2) the selection of seed data for training classifiers lacks clear criteria and relies heavily on human expertise, introducing a degree of subjectivity. To address the first challenge, we introduce an efficient verification strategy that enables rapid evaluation of the impact of data on LLM training with minimal computational cost. To tackle the second challenge, we build upon the assumption that high-quality seed data is beneficial for LLM training, and by integrating the proposed verification strategy, we optimize the selection of positive and negative samples and propose an efficient data filtering pipeline. This pipeline not only improves filtering efficiency, classifier quality, and robustness, but also significantly reduces experimental and inference costs. In addition, to efficiently filter high-quality data, we employ a lightweight classifier based on fastText, and successfully apply the filtering pipeline to two widely-used pre-training corpora, FineWeb and Chinese FineWeb datasets, resulting in the creation of the higher-quality Ultra-FineWeb dataset. Ultra-FineWeb contains approximately 1 trillion English tokens and 120 billion Chinese tokens. Empirical results demonstrate that the LLMs trained on Ultra-FineWeb exhibit significant performance improvements across multiple benchmark tasks, validating the effectiveness of our pipeline in enhancing both data quality and training efficiency.

      The impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) has extended into literary domains. However, existing evaluation metrics prioritize mechanical accuracy over artistic expression and tend to overrate machine translation (MT) as being superior to experienced professional human translation. In the long run, this bias could result in a permanent decline in translation quality and cultural authenticity. In response to the urgent need for a specialized literary evaluation metric, we introduce TransProQA, a novel, reference-free, LLM-based question-answering (QA) framework designed specifically for literary translation evaluation. TransProQA uniquely integrates insights from professional literary translators and researchers, focusing on critical elements in literary quality assessment such as literary devices, cultural understanding, and authorial voice. Our extensive evaluation shows that while literary-finetuned XCOMET-XL yields marginal gains, TransProQA substantially outperforms current metrics, achieving up to 0.07 gain in correlation (ACC-EQ and Kendall's tau) and surpassing the best state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics by over 15 points in adequacy assessments. Incorporating professional translator insights as weights further improves performance, highlighting the value of translator inputs. Notably, TransProQA approaches human-level evaluation performance comparable to trained linguistic annotators. It demonstrates broad applicability to open-source models such as LLaMA3.3-70b and Qwen2.5-32b, indicating its potential as an accessible and training-free literary evaluation metric and a valuable tool for evaluating texts that require local processing due to copyright or ethical considerations.

      Framing in media critically shapes public perception by selectively emphasizing some details while downplaying others. With the rise of large language models in automated news and content creation, there is growing concern that these systems may introduce or even amplify framing biases compared to human authors. In this paper, we explore how framing manifests in both out-of-the-box and fine-tuned LLM-generated news content. Our analysis reveals that, particularly in politically and socially sensitive contexts, LLMs tend to exhibit more pronounced framing than their human counterparts. In addition, we observe significant variation in framing tendencies across different model architectures, with some models displaying notably higher biases. These findings point to the need for effective post-training mitigation strategies and tighter evaluation frameworks to ensure that automated news content upholds the standards of balanced reporting.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on historical web data inevitably become outdated. We investigate evaluation strategies and update methods for LLMs as new data becomes available. We introduce a web-scale dataset for time-continual pretraining of LLMs derived from 114 dumps of Common Crawl (CC) - orders of magnitude larger than previous continual language modeling benchmarks. We also design time-stratified evaluations across both general CC data and specific domains (Wikipedia, StackExchange, and code documentation) to assess how well various continual learning methods adapt to new data while retaining past knowledge. Our findings demonstrate that, on general CC data, autoregressive meta-schedules combined with a fixed-ratio replay of older data can achieve comparable held-out loss to re-training from scratch, while requiring significantly less computation (2.6x). However, the optimal balance between incorporating new data and replaying old data differs as replay is crucial to avoid forgetting on generic web data but less so on specific domains.

      Differential testing offers a promising strategy to alleviate the test oracle problem by comparing the test results between alternative implementations. However, existing differential testing techniques for deep learning (DL) libraries are limited by the key challenges of finding alternative implementations (called counterparts) for a given API and subsequently generating diverse test inputs. To address the two challenges, this paper introduces DLLens, an LLM-enhanced differential testing technique for DL libraries. To address the first challenge, DLLens incorporates an LLM-based counterpart synthesis workflow, with the insight that the counterpart of a given DL library API's computation could be successfully synthesized through certain composition and adaptation of the APIs from another DL library. To address the second challenge, DLLens incorporates a static analysis technique that extracts the path constraints from the implementations of a given API and its counterpart to guide diverse test input generation. The extraction is facilitated by LLM's knowledge of the concerned DL library and its upstream libraries. We evaluate DLLens on two popular DL libraries, TensorFlow and PyTorch. Our evaluation shows that DLLens synthesizes counterparts for 1.84 times as many APIs as those found by state-of-the-art techniques on these libraries. Moreover, under the same time budget, DLLens covers 7.23% more branches and detects 1.88 times as many bugs as state-of-the-art techniques on 200 randomly sampled APIs. DLLens has successfully detected 71 bugs in recent TensorFlow and PyTorch libraries. Among them, 59 are confirmed by developers, including 46 confirmed as previously unknown bugs, and 10 of these previously unknown bugs have been fixed in the latest version of TensorFlow and PyTorch.

      Recent advances in leveraging the agentic paradigm of large language models (LLMs) utilization have significantly enhanced Text-to-SQL capabilities, enabling users without specialized database expertise to query data intuitively. However, deploying these agentic LLM-based Text-to-SQL systems in production poses substantial challenges due to their inherently multi-stage workflows, stringent latency constraints, and potentially heterogeneous GPU infrastructure in enterprise environments. Current LLM serving frameworks lack effective mechanisms for handling interdependent inference tasks, dynamic latency variability, and resource heterogeneity, leading to suboptimal performance and frequent service-level objective (SLO) violations. In this paper, we introduce HEXGEN-TEXT2SQL, a novel framework designed explicitly to schedule and execute agentic multi-stage LLM-based Text-to-SQL workflows on heterogeneous GPU clusters that handle multi-tenant end-to-end queries. HEXGEN-TEXT2SQL introduce a hierarchical scheduling approach combining global workload-balanced task dispatching and local adaptive urgency-guided prioritization, guided by a systematic analysis of agentic Text-to-SQL workflows. Additionally, we propose a lightweight simulation-based method for tuning critical scheduling hyperparameters, further enhancing robustness and adaptability. Our extensive evaluation on realistic Text-to-SQL benchmarks demonstrates that HEXGEN-TEXT2SQL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM serving frameworks. Specifically, HEXGEN-TEXT2SQL reduces latency deadlines by up to 1.67$\times$ (average: 1.41$\times$) and improves system throughput by up to 1.75$\times$ (average: 1.65$\times$) compared to vLLM under diverse, realistic workload conditions.

      Few-shot tabular learning, in which machine learning models are trained with a limited amount of labeled data, provides a cost-effective approach to addressing real-world challenges. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked interest in leveraging their pre-trained knowledge for few-shot tabular learning. Despite promising results, existing approaches either rely on test-time knowledge extraction, which introduces undesirable latency, or text-level knowledge, which leads to unreliable feature engineering. To overcome these limitations, we propose Latte, a training-time knowledge extraction framework that transfers the latent prior knowledge within LLMs to optimize a more generalized downstream model. Latte enables general knowledge-guided downstream tabular learning, facilitating the weighted fusion of information across different feature values while reducing the risk of overfitting to limited labeled data. Furthermore, Latte is compatible with existing unsupervised pre-training paradigms and effectively utilizes available unlabeled samples to overcome the performance limitations imposed by an extremely small labeled dataset. Extensive experiments on various few-shot tabular learning benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of Latte, establishing it as a state-of-the-art approach in this domain

      The rapid advancement of Chinese large language models (LLMs) underscores the need for domain-specific evaluations to ensure reliable applications. However, existing benchmarks often lack coverage in vertical domains and offer limited insights into the Chinese working context. Leveraging qualification exams as a unified framework for human expertise evaluation, we introduce QualBench, the first multi-domain Chinese QA benchmark dedicated to localized assessment of Chinese LLMs. The dataset includes over 17,000 questions across six vertical domains, with data selections grounded in 24 Chinese qualifications to closely align with national policies and working standards. Through comprehensive evaluation, the Qwen2.5 model outperformed the more advanced GPT-4o, with Chinese LLMs consistently surpassing non-Chinese models, highlighting the importance of localized domain knowledge in meeting qualification requirements. The best performance of 75.26% reveals the current gaps in domain coverage within model capabilities. Furthermore, we present the failure of LLM collaboration with crowdsourcing mechanisms and suggest the opportunities for multi-domain RAG knowledge enhancement and vertical domain LLM training with Federated Learning.

      Efficient path planning in robotics, particularly within large-scale, dynamic environments, remains a significant hurdle. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning capabilities, their high computational cost and limited adaptability in dynamic scenarios hinder real-time deployment on edge devices. We present SmallPlan -- a novel framework leveraging LLMs as teacher models to train lightweight Small Language Models (SLMs) for high-level path planning tasks. In SmallPlan, the SLMs provide optimal action sequences to navigate across scene graphs that compactly represent full-scaled 3D scenes. The SLMs are trained in a simulation-powered, interleaved manner with LLM-guided supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). This strategy not only enables SLMs to successfully complete navigation tasks but also makes them aware of important factors like travel distance and number of trials. Through experiments, we demonstrate that the fine-tuned SLMs perform competitively with larger models like GPT-4o on sequential path planning, without suffering from hallucination and overfitting. SmallPlan is resource-efficient, making it well-suited for edge-device deployment and advancing practical autonomous robotics.

      We present a systematic study of provider-side data poisoning in retrieval-augmented recommender systems (RAG-based). By modifying only a small fraction of tokens within item descriptions -- for instance, adding emotional keywords or borrowing phrases from semantically related items -- an attacker can significantly promote or demote targeted items. We formalize these attacks under token-edit and semantic-similarity constraints, and we examine their effectiveness in both promotion (long-tail items) and demotion (short-head items) scenarios. Our experiments on MovieLens, using two large language model (LLM) retrieval modules, show that even subtle attacks shift final rankings and item exposures while eluding naive detection. The results underscore the vulnerability of RAG-based pipelines to small-scale metadata rewrites and emphasize the need for robust textual consistency checks and provenance tracking to thwart stealthy provider-side poisoning.

      While Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a popular technique for improving Large Language Model (LLM) systems, it introduces a large number of choices, parameters and hyperparameters that must be made or tuned. This includes the LLM, embedding, and ranker models themselves, as well as hyperparameters governing individual RAG components. Yet, collectively optimizing the entire configuration in a RAG or LLM system remains under-explored - especially in multi-objective settings - due to intractably large solution spaces, noisy objective evaluations, and the high cost of evaluations. In this work, we introduce the first approach for multi-objective parameter optimization of cost, latency, safety and alignment over entire LLM and RAG systems. We find that Bayesian optimization methods significantly outperform baseline approaches, obtaining a superior Pareto front on two new RAG benchmark tasks. We conclude our work with important considerations for practitioners who are designing multi-objective RAG systems, highlighting nuances such as how optimal configurations may not generalize across tasks and objectives.

      Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are crucial in modern software development. Large Language Models (LLMs) assist in automated code generation but often struggle with API hallucination, including invoking non-existent APIs and misusing existing ones in practical development scenarios. Existing studies resort to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods for mitigating the hallucination issue, but tend to fail since they generally ignore the structural dependencies in practical projects and do not indeed validate whether the generated APIs are available or not. To address these limitations, we propose MARIN, a framework for mitigating API hallucination in code generated by LLMs with hierarchical dependency aware. MARIN consists of two phases: Hierarchical Dependency Mining, which analyzes local and global dependencies of the current function, aiming to supplement comprehensive project context in LLMs input, and Dependency Constrained Decoding, which utilizes mined dependencies to adaptively constrain the generation process, aiming to ensure the generated APIs align with the projects specifications. To facilitate the evaluation of the degree of API hallucination, we introduce a new benchmark APIHulBench and two new metrics including Micro Hallucination Number (MiHN) and Macro Hallucination Rate (MaHR). Experiments on six state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that MARIN effectively reduces API hallucinations, achieving an average decrease of 67.52% in MiHN and 73.56% in MaHR compared to the RAG approach. Applied to Huaweis internal projects and two proprietary LLMs, MARIN achieves average decreases of 57.33% in MiHN and 59.41% in MaHR.

      Achieving both accuracy and diverse reasoning remains challenging for Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex domains like mathematics. A key bottleneck is evaluating intermediate reasoning steps to guide generation without costly human annotations. To address this, we first introduce a novel Process Reward Model (PRM) trained automatically using Monte Carlo Tree Search coupled with a similarity-based data augmentation technique, effectively capturing step-level reasoning quality. Leveraging this PRM, we then adapt Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to operate at the reasoning step level. Unlike traditional reinforcement learning focused on maximizing a single reward, GFlowNets naturally sample diverse, high-quality solutions proportional to their rewards, as measured by our PRM. Empirical evaluation shows strong improvements in both accuracy and solution diversity on challenging mathematical benchmarks (e.g., +2.59% absolute accuracy on MATH Level 5 for Llama3.2-3B), with effective generalization to unseen datasets (+9.4% absolute on SAT MATH). Our work demonstrates the potential of PRM-guided, step-level GFlowNets for developing more robust and versatile mathematical reasoning in LLMs.

      According to Yuval Noah Harari, large-scale human cooperation is driven by shared narratives that encode common beliefs and values. This study explores whether such narratives can similarly nudge LLM agents toward collaboration. We use a finitely repeated public goods game in which LLM agents choose either cooperative or egoistic spending strategies. We prime agents with stories highlighting teamwork to different degrees and test how this influences negotiation outcomes. Our experiments explore four questions:(1) How do narratives influence negotiation behavior? (2) What differs when agents share the same story versus different ones? (3) What happens when the agent numbers grow? (4) Are agents resilient against self-serving negotiators? We find that story-based priming significantly affects negotiation strategies and success rates. Common stories improve collaboration, benefiting each agent. By contrast, priming agents with different stories reverses this effect, and those agents primed toward self-interest prevail. We hypothesize that these results carry implications for multi-agent system design and AI alignment.

      This paper presents a simple, effective, and cost-efficient strategy to improve LLM performance by scaling test-time compute. Our strategy builds upon the repeated-sampling-then-voting framework, with a novel twist: incorporating multiple models, even weaker ones, to leverage their complementary strengths that potentially arise from diverse training data and paradigms. By using consistency as a signal, our strategy dynamically switches between models. Theoretical analysis highlights the efficiency and performance advantages of our strategy. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that our strategy not only outperforms self-consistency and state-of-the-art multi-agent debate approaches, but also significantly reduces inference costs. Additionally, ModelSwitch requires only a few comparable LLMs to achieve optimal performance and can be extended with verification methods, demonstrating the potential of leveraging multiple LLMs in the generation-verification paradigm.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in recommender systems aimed at both individuals and groups. Previously, Group Recommender Systems (GRS) often used social choice-based aggregation strategies to derive a single recommendation based on the preferences of multiple people. In this paper, we investigate under which conditions language models can perform these strategies correctly based on zero-shot learning and analyse whether the formatting of the group scenario in the prompt affects accuracy. We specifically focused on the impact of group complexity (number of users and items), different LLMs, different prompting conditions, including In-Context learning or generating explanations, and the formatting of group preferences. Our results show that performance starts to deteriorate when considering more than 100 ratings. However, not all language models were equally sensitive to growing group complexity. Additionally, we showed that In-Context Learning (ICL) can significantly increase the performance at higher degrees of group complexity, while adding other prompt modifications, specifying domain cues or prompting for explanations, did not impact accuracy. We conclude that future research should include group complexity as a factor in GRS evaluation due to its effect on LLM performance. Furthermore, we showed that formatting the group scenarios differently, such as rating lists per user or per item, affected accuracy. All in all, our study implies that smaller LLMs are capable of generating group recommendations under the right conditions, making the case for using smaller models that require less computing power and costs.

      Evaluation is fundamental in optimizing search experiences and supporting diverse user intents in Information Retrieval (IR). Traditional search evaluation methods primarily rely on relevance labels, which assess how well retrieved documents match a user's query. However, relevance alone fails to capture a search system's effectiveness in helping users achieve their search goals, making usefulness a critical evaluation criterion. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach: LLM-generated usefulness labels, which incorporate both implicit and explicit user behavior signals to evaluate document usefulness. We propose Task-aware Rubric-based Usefulness Evaluation (TRUE), a rubric-driven evaluation method that employs iterative sampling and reasoning to model complex search behavior patterns. Our findings show that (i) LLMs can generate moderate usefulness labels by leveraging comprehensive search session history incorporating personalization and contextual understanding, and (ii) fine-tuned LLMs improve usefulness judgments when provided with structured search session contexts. Additionally, we examine whether LLMs can distinguish between relevance and usefulness, particularly in cases where this divergence impacts search success. We also conduct an ablation study to identify key metrics for accurate usefulness label generation, optimizing for token efficiency and cost-effectiveness in real-world applications. This study advances LLM-based usefulness evaluation by refining key user metrics, exploring LLM-generated label reliability, and ensuring feasibility for large-scale search systems.

      Test collections are information retrieval tools that allow researchers to quickly and easily evaluate ranking algorithms. While test collections have become an integral part of IR research, the process of data creation involves significant effort in manual annotations, which often makes it very expensive and time-consuming. Thus, test collections could become too small when the budget is limited, which may lead to unstable evaluations. As a cheaper alternative, recent studies have proposed the use of large language models (LLMs) to completely replace human assessors. However, while LLMs seem to somewhat correlate with human judgments, their predictions are not perfect and often show bias. Thus a complete replacement with LLMs is argued to be too risky and not fully reliable. Thus, in this paper, we propose LLM-Assisted Relevance Assessments (LARA), an effective method to balance manual annotations with LLM annotations, which helps to build a rich and reliable test collection even under a low budget. We use the LLM's predicted relevance probabilities to select the most profitable documents to manually annotate under a budget constraint. With theoretical reasoning, LARA effectively guides the human annotation process by actively learning to calibrate the LLM's predicted relevance probabilities. Then, using the calibration model learned from the limited manual annotations, LARA debiases the LLM predictions to annotate the remaining non-assessed data. Empirical evaluations on TREC-7 Ad Hoc, TREC-8 Ad Hoc, TREC Robust 2004, and TREC-COVID datasets show that LARA outperforms alternative solutions under almost any budget constraint.

      Advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, offer significant opportunities to enhance instructional support in introductory programming courses. While extensive research has explored the effectiveness of LLMs in supporting student learning, limited studies have examined how these models can assist instructors in designing instructional activities. This work investigates how instructors' expertise in effective activity design can be integrated with LLMs' ability to generate novel and targeted programming problems, facilitating more effective activity creation for programming classrooms. To achieve this, we employ a participatory design approach to develop an instructor-authoring tool that incorporates LLM support, fostering collaboration between instructors and AI in generating programming exercises. This tool also allows instructors to specify common student mistakes and misconceptions, which informs the adaptive feedback generation process. We conduct case studies with three instructors, analyzing how they use our system to design programming problems for their introductory courses. Through these case studies, we assess instructors' perceptions of the usefulness and limitations of LLMs in authoring problem statements for instructional purposes. Additionally, we compare the efficiency, quality, effectiveness, and coverage of designed activities when instructors create problems with and without structured LLM prompting guidelines. Our findings provide insights into the potential of LLMs in enhancing instructor workflows and improving programming education and provide guidelines for designing effective AI-assisted problem-authoring interfaces.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with code generation tasks involving niche software libraries. Existing code generation techniques with only human-oriented documentation can fail -- even when the LLM has access to web search and the library is documented online. To address this challenge, we propose ReadMe$.$LLM, LLM-oriented documentation for software libraries. By attaching the contents of ReadMe$.$LLM to a query, performance consistently improves to near-perfect accuracy, with one case study demonstrating up to 100% success across all tested models. We propose a software development lifecycle where LLM-specific documentation is maintained alongside traditional software updates.

      This survey explores recent advancements in reasoning large language models (LLMs) designed to mimic "slow thinking" - a reasoning process inspired by human cognition, as described in Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow. These models, like OpenAI's o1, focus on scaling computational resources dynamically during complex tasks, such as math reasoning, visual reasoning, medical diagnosis, and multi-agent debates. We present the development of reasoning LLMs and list their key technologies. By synthesizing over 100 studies, it charts a path toward LLMs that combine human-like deep thinking with scalable efficiency for reasoning. The review breaks down methods into three categories: (1) test-time scaling dynamically adjusts computation based on task complexity via search and sampling, dynamic verification; (2) reinforced learning refines decision-making through iterative improvement leveraging policy networks, reward models, and self-evolution strategies; and (3) slow-thinking frameworks (e.g., long CoT, hierarchical processes) that structure problem-solving with manageable steps. The survey highlights the challenges and further directions of this domain. Understanding and advancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs is crucial for unlocking their full potential in real-world applications, from scientific discovery to decision support systems.

      Recommender systems are essential for delivering personalized content across digital platforms by modeling user preferences and behaviors. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been adopted for prompt-based recommendation due to their ability to generate personalized outputs without task-specific training. However, LLM-based methods face limitations such as limited context window size, inefficient pointwise and pairwise prompting, and difficulty handling listwise ranking due to token constraints. LLMs can also be sensitive to position bias, as they may overemphasize earlier items in the prompt regardless of their true relevance. To address and investigate these issues, we propose a hybrid framework that combines a traditional recommendation model with an LLM for reranking top-k items using structured prompts. We evaluate the effects of user history reordering and instructional prompts for mitigating position bias. Experiments on MovieLens-100K show that randomizing user history improves ranking quality, but LLM-based reranking does not outperform the base model. Explicit instructions to reduce position bias are also ineffective. Our evaluations reveal limitations in LLMs' ability to model ranking context and mitigate bias.

      Effective information searching is essential for enhancing the reasoning and generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Recent research has explored using reinforcement learning (RL) to improve LLMs' search capabilities by interacting with live search engines in real-world environments. While these approaches show promising results, they face two major challenges: (1) Uncontrolled Document Quality: The quality of documents returned by search engines is often unpredictable, introducing noise and instability into the training process. (2) Prohibitively High API Costs: RL training requires frequent rollouts, potentially involving hundreds of thousands of search requests, which incur substantial API expenses and severely constrain scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce ZeroSearch, a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes the search capabilities of LLMs without interacting with real search engines. Our approach begins with lightweight supervised fine-tuning to transform the LLM into a retrieval module capable of generating both relevant and noisy documents in response to a query. During RL training, we employ a curriculum-based rollout strategy that incrementally degrades the quality of generated documents, progressively eliciting the model's reasoning ability by exposing it to increasingly challenging retrieval scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ZeroSearch effectively incentivizes the search capabilities of LLMs using a 3B LLM as the retrieval module. Remarkably, a 7B retrieval module achieves comparable performance to the real search engine, while a 14B retrieval module even surpasses it. Furthermore, it generalizes well across both base and instruction-tuned models of various parameter sizes and is compatible with a wide range of RL algorithms.

      LLM-integrated app systems extend the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) with third-party apps that are invoked by a system LLM using interleaved planning and execution phases to answer user queries. These systems introduce new attack vectors where malicious apps can cause integrity violation of planning or execution, availability breakdown, or privacy compromise during execution. In this work, we identify new attacks impacting the integrity of planning, as well as the integrity and availability of execution in LLM-integrated apps, and demonstrate them against IsolateGPT, a recent solution designed to mitigate attacks from malicious apps. We propose Abstract-Concrete-Execute (ACE), a new secure architecture for LLM-integrated app systems that provides security guarantees for system planning and execution. Specifically, ACE decouples planning into two phases by first creating an abstract execution plan using only trusted information, and then mapping the abstract plan to a concrete plan using installed system apps. We verify that the plans generated by our system satisfy user-specified secure information flow constraints via static analysis on the structured plan output. During execution, ACE enforces data and capability barriers between apps, and ensures that the execution is conducted according to the trusted abstract plan. We show experimentally that our system is secure against attacks from the INJECAGENT benchmark, a standard benchmark for control flow integrity in the face of indirect prompt injection attacks, and our newly introduced attacks. Our architecture represents a significant advancement towards hardening LLM-based systems containing system facilities of varying levels of trustworthiness.

      Recently emerged 6G space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs), which integrate satellites, aerial networks, and terrestrial communications, offer ubiquitous coverage for various mobile applications. However, the highly dynamic, open, and heterogeneous nature of SAGINs poses severe security issues. Forming a defense line of SAGINs suffers from two preliminary challenges: 1) accurately understanding massive unstructured multi-dimensional threat information to generate defense strategies against various malicious attacks, 2) rapidly adapting to potential unknown threats to yield more effective security strategies. To tackle the above two challenges, we propose a novel security framework for SAGINs based on Large Language Models (LLMs), which consists of two key ingredients LLM-6GNG and 6G-INST. Our proposed LLM-6GNG leverages refined chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and dynamic multi-agent mechanisms to analyze massive unstructured multi-dimensional threat data and generate comprehensive security strategies, thus addressing the first challenge. Our proposed 6G-INST relies on a novel self-evolving method to automatically update LLM-6GNG, enabling it to accommodate unknown threats under dynamic communication environments, thereby addressing the second challenge. Additionally, we prototype the proposed framework with ns-3, OpenAirInterface (OAI), and software-defined radio (SDR). Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. The results show that our framework produces highly accurate security strategies that remain robust against a variety of unknown attacks. We will release our code to contribute to the community.

This research aims to compare the energy consumption of manual software development versus an LLM-assisted approach, using Codeforces as a simulation platform for software development. The goal is to quantify the environmental impact and propose strategies for minimising the carbon footprint of using LLM in software development. Our results show that the LLM-assisted code generation leads on average to 32.72 higher carbon footprint than the manual one. Moreover, there is a significant correlation between task complexity and the difference in the carbon footprint of the two approaches.

To leverage benefits like missing value imputation, labeling, and enrichment with context-aware attributes, LLM-generated data needs a critical validation process. The number of pioneering approaches is increasing fast, opening a promising validation space that, so far, remains unstructured. We present a design space for the critical validation of LLM-generated tabular data with two dimensions: First, the Analysis Granularity dimension: from within-attribute (single-item and multi-item) to across-attribute perspectives (1 x 1, 1 x m, and n x n). Second, the Data Source dimension: differentiating between LLM-generated values, ground truth values, explanations, and their combinations. We discuss analysis tasks for each dimension cross-cut, map 19 existing validation approaches, and discuss the characteristics of two approaches in detail, demonstrating descriptive power.

      Trajectory prediction is a crucial task in modeling human behavior, especially in fields as social robotics and autonomous vehicle navigation. Traditional heuristics based on handcrafted rules often lack accuracy, while recently proposed deep learning approaches suffer from computational cost, lack of explainability, and generalization issues that limit their practical adoption. In this paper, we introduce TrajEvo, a framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically design trajectory prediction heuristics. TrajEvo employs an evolutionary algorithm to generate and refine prediction heuristics from past trajectory data. We introduce a Cross-Generation Elite Sampling to promote population diversity and a Statistics Feedback Loop allowing the LLM to analyze alternative predictions. Our evaluations show TrajEvo outperforms previous heuristic methods on the ETH-UCY datasets, and remarkably outperforms both heuristics and deep learning methods when generalizing to the unseen SDD dataset. TrajEvo represents a first step toward automated design of fast, explainable, and generalizable trajectory prediction heuristics.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) show promising performance on various programming tasks, including Automatic Program Repair (APR). However, most approaches to LLM-based APR are limited to the static analysis of the programs, while disregarding their runtime behavior. Inspired by knowledge-augmented NLP, in this work, we aim to remedy this potential blind spot by augmenting standard APR prompts with program execution traces. We evaluate our approach using the GPT family of models on three popular APR datasets. Our findings suggest that simply incorporating execution traces into the prompt provides a limited performance improvement over trace-free baselines, in only 2 out of 6 tested dataset / model configurations. We further find that the effectiveness of execution traces for APR diminishes as their complexity increases. We explore several strategies for leveraging traces in prompts and demonstrate that LLM-optimized prompts help outperform trace-free prompts more consistently. Additionally, we show trace-based prompting to be superior to finetuning a smaller LLM on a small-scale dataset; and conduct probing studies reinforcing the notion that execution traces can complement the reasoning abilities of the LLMs.

      Over the past few years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have developed rapidly and are widely applied in various domains. However, LLMs face the issue of hallucinations, generating responses that may be unreliable when the models lack relevant knowledge. To be aware of potential hallucinations, uncertainty estimation methods have been introduced, and most of them have confirmed that reliability lies in critical tokens. However, probability-based methods perform poorly in identifying token reliability, limiting their practical utility. In this paper, we reveal that the probability-based method fails to estimate token reliability due to the loss of evidence strength information which is accumulated in the training stage. Therefore, we present Logits-induced token uncertainty (LogTokU), a framework for estimating decoupled token uncertainty in LLMs, enabling real-time uncertainty estimation without requiring multiple sampling processes. We employ evidence modeling to implement LogTokU and use the estimated uncertainty to guide downstream tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that LogTokU has significant effectiveness and promise.

      Sequential recommendation (SR) leverages users' dynamic preferences, with recent advances incorporating multi-interest learning to model diverse user interests. However, most multi-interest SR models rely on noisy, sparse implicit feedback, limiting recommendation accuracy. Large language models (LLMs) offer robust reasoning on low-quality data but face high computational costs and latency challenges for SR integration. We propose a novel LLM-based multi-interest SR framework combining implicit behavioral and explicit semantic perspectives. It includes two modules: the Implicit Behavioral Interest Module (IBIM), which learns from user behavior using a traditional SR model, and the Explicit Semantic Interest Module (ESIM), which uses clustering and prompt-engineered LLMs to extract semantic multi-interest representations from informative samples. Semantic insights from ESIM enhance IBIM's behavioral representations via modality alignment and semantic prediction tasks. During inference, only IBIM is used, ensuring efficient, LLM-free recommendations. Experiments on four real-world datasets validate the framework's effectiveness and practicality.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential for complex reasoning, yet their capacity for emergent coordination in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) when operating under strict constraints-such as limited local perception and communication, characteristic of natural swarms-remains largely unexplored, particularly concerning the nuances of swarm intelligence. Existing benchmarks often do not fully capture the unique challenges of decentralized coordination that arise when agents operate with incomplete spatio-temporal information. To bridge this gap, we introduce SwarmBench, a novel benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the swarm intelligence capabilities of LLMs acting as decentralized agents. SwarmBench features five foundational MAS coordination tasks within a configurable 2D grid environment, forcing agents to rely primarily on local sensory input (k x k view) and local communication. We propose metrics for coordination effectiveness and analyze emergent group dynamics. Evaluating several leading LLMs in a zero-shot setting, we find significant performance variations across tasks, highlighting the difficulties posed by local information constraints. While some coordination emerges, results indicate limitations in robust planning and strategy formation under uncertainty in these decentralized scenarios. Assessing LLMs under swarm-like conditions is crucial for realizing their potential in future decentralized systems. We release SwarmBench as an open, extensible toolkit-built upon a customizable and scalable physical system with defined mechanical properties. It provides environments, prompts, evaluation scripts, and the comprehensive experimental datasets generated, aiming to foster reproducible research into LLM-based MAS coordination and the theoretical underpinnings of Embodied MAS.

      Spatial reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) is the foundation for embodied intelligence. However, even in simple maze environments, LLMs still encounter challenges in long-term path-planning, primarily influenced by their spatial hallucination and context inconsistency hallucination by long-term reasoning. To address this challenge, this study proposes an innovative model, Spatial-to-Relational Transformation and Curriculum Q-Learning (S2RCQL). To address the spatial hallucination of LLMs, we propose the Spatial-to-Relational approach, which transforms spatial prompts into entity relations and paths representing entity relation chains. This approach fully taps the potential of LLMs in terms of sequential thinking. As a result, we design a path-planning algorithm based on Q-learning to mitigate the context inconsistency hallucination, which enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs. Using the Q-value of state-action as auxiliary information for prompts, we correct the hallucinations of LLMs, thereby guiding LLMs to learn the optimal path. Finally, we propose a reverse curriculum learning technique based on LLMs to further mitigate the context inconsistency hallucination. LLMs can rapidly accumulate successful experiences by reducing task difficulty and leveraging them to tackle more complex tasks. We performed comprehensive experiments based on Baidu's self-developed LLM: ERNIE-Bot 4.0. The results showed that our S2RCQL achieved a 23%--40% improvement in both success and optimality rates compared with advanced prompt engineering.

      As large language models (LLMs) improve in their capacity to serve as personal AI assistants, their ability to output uniquely tailored, personalized responses that align with the soft preferences of their users is essential for enhancing user satisfaction and retention. However, untrained lay users have poor prompt specification abilities and often struggle with conveying their latent preferences to AI assistants. To address this, we leverage activation steering to guide LLMs to align with interpretable preference dimensions during inference. In contrast to memory-based personalization methods that require longer user history, steering is extremely lightweight and can be easily controlled by the user via an linear strength factor. We embed steering into three different interactive chatbot interfaces and conduct a within-subjects user study (n=14) to investigate how end users prefer to personalize their conversations. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of preference-based steering for aligning real-world conversations with hidden user preferences, and highlight further insights on how diverse values around control, usability, and transparency lead users to prefer different interfaces.

      With open-source projects growing in size and complexity, manual compilation becomes tedious and error-prone, highlighting the need for automation to improve efficiency and accuracy. However, the complexity of compilation instruction search and error resolution makes automatic compilation challenging. Inspired by the success of LLM-based agents in various fields, we propose CompileAgent, the first LLM-based agent framework dedicated to repo-level compilation. CompileAgent integrates five tools and a flow-based agent strategy, enabling interaction with software artifacts for compilation instruction search and error resolution. To measure the effectiveness of our method, we design a public repo-level benchmark CompileAgentBench, and we also design two baselines for comparison by combining two compilation-friendly schemes. The performance on this benchmark shows that our method significantly improves the compilation success rate, ranging from 10% to 71%. Meanwhile, we evaluate the performance of CompileAgent under different agent strategies and verify the effectiveness of the flow-based strategy. Additionally, we emphasize the scalability of CompileAgent, further expanding its application prospects.

      Large Language Models~(LLMs) are prone to hallucinations, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) helps mitigate this, but at a high computational cost while risking misinformation. Adaptive retrieval aims to retrieve only when necessary, but existing approaches rely on LLM-based uncertainty estimation, which remain inefficient and impractical. In this study, we introduce lightweight LLM-independent adaptive retrieval methods based on external information. We investigated 27 features, organized into 7 groups, and their hybrid combinations. We evaluated these methods on 6 QA datasets, assessing the QA performance and efficiency. The results show that our approach matches the performance of complex LLM-based methods while achieving significant efficiency gains, demonstrating the potential of external information for adaptive retrieval.

      Multi-agent autonomous systems (MAS) are better at addressing challenges that spans across multiple domains than singular autonomous agents. This holds true within the field of software engineering (SE) as well. The state-of-the-art research on MAS within SE focuses on integrating LLMs at the core of autonomous agents to create LLM-based multi-agent autonomous (LMA) systems. However, the introduction of LMA systems into SE brings a plethora of challenges. One of the major challenges is the strategic allocation of tasks between humans and the LMA system in a trustworthy manner. To address this challenge, a RACI-based framework is proposed in this work in progress article, along with implementation guidelines and an example implementation of the framework. The proposed framework can facilitate efficient collaboration, ensure accountability, and mitigate potential risks associated with LLM-driven automation while aligning with the Trustworthy AI guidelines. The future steps for this work delineating the planned empirical validation method are also presented.

      E-commerce sellers are recommended keyphrases based on their inventory on which they advertise to increase buyer engagement (clicks/sales). The relevance of advertiser keyphrases plays an important role in preventing the inundation of search systems with numerous irrelevant items that compete for attention in auctions, in addition to maintaining a healthy seller perception. In this work, we describe the shortcomings of training Advertiser keyphrase relevance filter models on click/sales/search relevance signals and the importance of aligning with human judgment, as sellers have the power to adopt or reject said keyphrase recommendations. In this study, we frame Advertiser keyphrase relevance as a complex interaction between 3 dynamical systems -- seller judgment, which influences seller adoption of our product, Advertising, which provides the keyphrases to bid on, and Search, who holds the auctions for the same keyphrases. This study discusses the practicalities of using human judgment via a case study at eBay Advertising and demonstrate that using LLM-as-a-judge en-masse as a scalable proxy for seller judgment to train our relevance models achieves a better harmony across the three systems -- provided that they are bound by a meticulous evaluation framework grounded in business metrics.

      Scaling Large Language Model (LLM) training relies on multi-dimensional parallelism, where High-Bandwidth Domains (HBDs) are critical for communication-intensive parallelism like Tensor Parallelism (TP) and Expert Parallelism (EP). However, existing HBD architectures face fundamental limitations in scalability, cost, and fault resiliency: switch-centric HBDs (e.g., NVL-72) incur prohibitive scaling costs, while GPU-centric HBDs (e.g., TPUv3/Dojo) suffer from severe fault propagation. Switch-GPU hybrid HBDs such as TPUv4 takes a middle-ground approach by leveraging Optical Circuit Switches, but the fault explosion radius remains large at the cube level (e.g., 64 TPUs). We propose InfiniteHBD, a novel transceiver-centric HBD architecture that unifies connectivity and dynamic switching at the transceiver level using Optical Circuit Switching (OCS). By embedding OCS within each transceiver, InfiniteHBD achieves reconfigurable point-to-multipoint connectivity, allowing the topology to adapt into variable-size rings. This design provides: i) datacenter-wide scalability without cost explosion; ii) fault resilience by isolating failures to a single node, and iii) full bandwidth utilization for fault-free GPUs. Key innovations include a Silicon Photonic (SiPh) based low-cost OCS transceiver (OCSTrx), a reconfigurable k-hop ring topology co-designed with intra-/inter-node communication, and an HBD-DCN orchestration algorithm maximizing GPU utilization while minimizing cross-ToR datacenter network traffic. The evaluation demonstrates that InfiniteHBD achieves 31% of the cost of NVL-72, near-zero GPU waste ratio (over one order of magnitude lower than NVL-72 and TPUv4), near-zero cross-ToR traffic when node fault ratios under 7%, and improves Model FLOPs Utilization by 3.37x compared to NVIDIA DGX (8 GPUs per Node).

      Wireless roaming is a critical yet challenging task for maintaining seamless connectivity in dynamic mobile environments. Conventional threshold-based or heuristic schemes often fail, leading to either sticky or excessive handovers. We introduce the first cross-layer use of an on-device large language model (LLM): high-level reasoning in the application layer that issues real-time actions executed in the PHY/MAC stack. The LLM addresses two tasks: (i) context-aware AP selection, where structured prompts fuse environmental cues (e.g., location, time) to choose the best BSSID; and (ii) dynamic threshold adjustment, where the model adaptively decides when to roam. To satisfy the tight latency and resource budgets of edge hardware, we apply a suite of optimizations-chain-of-thought prompting, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and quantization. Experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets show that our approach surpasses legacy heuristics and DRL baselines, achieving a strong balance between roaming stability and signal quality. These findings underscore the promise of application-layer LLM reasoning for lower-layer wireless control in future edge systems.

      Existing large language models (LLMs) are advancing rapidly and produce outstanding results in image generation tasks, yet their content safety checks remain vulnerable to prompt-based jailbreaks. Through preliminary testing on platforms such as ChatGPT, MetaAI, and Grok, we observed that even short, natural prompts could lead to the generation of compromising images ranging from realistic depictions of forged documents to manipulated images of public figures. We introduce Unmasking the Canvas (UTC Benchmark; UTCB), a dynamic and scalable benchmark dataset to evaluate LLM vulnerability in image generation. Our methodology combines structured prompt engineering, multilingual obfuscation (e.g., Zulu, Gaelic, Base64), and evaluation using Groq-hosted LLaMA-3. The pipeline supports both zero-shot and fallback prompting strategies, risk scoring, and automated tagging. All generations are stored with rich metadata and curated into Bronze (non-verified), Silver (LLM-aided verification), and Gold (manually verified) tiers. UTCB is designed to evolve over time with new data sources, prompt templates, and model behaviors. Warning: This paper includes visual examples of adversarial inputs designed to test model safety.

      Color-word associations play a fundamental role in human cognition and design applications. Large Language Models (LLMs) have become widely available and have demonstrated intelligent behaviors in various benchmarks with natural conversation skills. However, their ability to replicate human color-word associations remains understudied. We compared multiple generations of LLMs (from GPT-3 to GPT-4o) against human color-word associations using data collected from over 10,000 Japanese participants, involving 17 colors and 80 words (10 word from eight categories) in Japanese. Our findings reveal a clear progression in LLM performance across generations, with GPT-4o achieving the highest accuracy in predicting the best voted word for each color and category. However, the highest median performance was approximately 50% even for GPT-4o with visual inputs (chance level of 10%). Moreover, we found performance variations across word categories and colors: while LLMs tended to excel in categories such as Rhythm and Landscape, they struggled with categories such as Emotions. Interestingly, color discrimination ability estimated from our color-word association data showed high correlation with human color discrimination patterns, consistent with previous studies. Thus, despite reasonable alignment in basic color discrimination, humans and LLMs still diverge systematically in the words they assign to those colors. Our study highlights both the advancements in LLM capabilities and their persistent limitations, raising the possibility of systematic differences in semantic memory structures between humans and LLMs in representing color-word associations.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency across a variety of complex tasks. One significant application of LLMs is in tackling software engineering challenges, particularly in resolving real-world tasks on GitHub by fixing code based on the issues reported by the users. However, many current approaches rely on proprietary LLMs, which limits reproducibility, accessibility, and transparency. The critical components of LLMs for addressing software engineering issues and how their capabilities can be effectively enhanced remain unclear. To address these challenges, we introduce SWE-Fixer, a novel open-source framework designed to effectively and efficiently resolve GitHub issues. SWE-Fixer comprises two essential modules: a code file retrieval module and a code editing module. The retrieval module employs BM25 along with a lightweight model to achieve coarse-to-fine file retrieval. Subsequently, the code editing module utilizes the other model to generate patches for the identified files. To mitigate the lack of publicly available datasets, we compile an extensive dataset that includes 110K GitHub issues along with their corresponding patches and train the two models of SWE-Fixer separately. We assess our approach on the SWE-Bench Lite and Verified benchmarks, achieving competitive performance among open-source models with scores of 22.0% and 30.2%. Furthermore, SWE-Fixer reaches state-of-the-art performance (24.7% on Lite and 32.8% on Verified) with PASS_TO_PASS (P2P) filtering. Additionally, our approach requires only two model calls per instance, making it significantly more efficient than existing methods. These results highlight the effectiveness of SWE-Fixer in real-world code-fixing scenarios. We will make our model, dataset, and code publicly available at https://github.com/InternLM/SWE-Fixer.

      Dynamic scenes contain intricate spatio-temporal information, crucial for mobile robots, UAVs, and autonomous driving systems to make informed decisions. Parsing these scenes into semantic triplets <Subject-Predicate-Object> for accurate Scene Graph Generation (SGG) is highly challenging due to the fluctuating spatio-temporal complexity. Inspired by the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose SceneLLM, a novel framework that leverages LLMs as powerful scene analyzers for dynamic SGG. Our framework introduces a Video-to-Language (V2L) mapping module that transforms video frames into linguistic signals (scene tokens), making the input more comprehensible for LLMs. To better encode spatial information, we devise a Spatial Information Aggregation (SIA) scheme, inspired by the structure of Chinese characters, which encodes spatial data into tokens. Using Optimal Transport (OT), we generate an implicit language signal from the frame-level token sequence that captures the video's spatio-temporal information. To further improve the LLM's ability to process this implicit linguistic input, we apply Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the model. Finally, we use a transformer-based SGG predictor to decode the LLM's reasoning and predict semantic triplets. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on the Action Genome (AG) benchmark, and extensive experiments show the effectiveness of SceneLLM in understanding and generating accurate dynamic scene graphs.

      This paper examines whether large language model (LLM) capabilities can continue to advance without additional compute by analyzing the development and role of algorithms used in state-of-the-art LLMs. Motivated by regulatory efforts that have largely focused on restricting access to high-performance hardware, we ask: Can LLMs progress in a compute-constrained environment, and how do algorithmic innovations perform under such conditions? To address these questions, we introduce a novel classification framework that distinguishes between compute-dependent innovations -- which yield disproportionate benefits at high compute levels (e.g., the Transformer architecture and mixture-of-experts models) and compute-independent innovations, which improve efficiency across all compute scales (e.g., rotary positional encoding, FlashAttention, or layer normalization). We quantify these contributions using a metric called compute-equivalent gain (CEG), which estimates the additional compute that would be required to achieve similar improvements without these algorithmic advancements. To validate this framework, we conduct small-scale training experiments with a scaled-down GPT-2 model. Our results confirm that compute-independent advancements yield meaningful performance gains even in resource-constrained settings, with a CEG of up to $3.5\times$ over a baseline model. By contrast, compute-dependent advancements provided little benefit or even degraded performance at the small scale, reinforcing the importance of compute availability for certain algorithmic gains.

      Tool invocation is a crucial mechanism for extending the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and has recently garnered significant attention. It enables LLMs to solve complex problems through tool calls while accessing up-to-date world knowledge. However, existing work primarily focuses on the fundamental ability of LLMs to invoke tools for problem-solving, without considering personalized constraints in tool invocation. In this work, we introduce the concept of Personalized Tool Invocation and define two key tasks: Tool Preference and Profile-dependent Query. Tool Preference addresses user preferences when selecting among functionally similar tools, while Profile-dependent Query considers cases where a user query lacks certain tool parameters, requiring the model to infer them from the user profile. To tackle these challenges, we propose PTool, a data synthesis framework designed for personalized tool invocation. Additionally, we construct \textbf{PTBench}, the first benchmark for evaluating personalized tool invocation. We then fine-tune various open-source models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework and providing valuable insights. Our benchmark is public at https://github.com/hyfshadow/PTBench.

      Efficient path planning in robotics, particularly within large-scale, dynamic environments, remains a significant hurdle. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning capabilities, their high computational cost and limited adaptability in dynamic scenarios hinder real-time deployment on edge devices. We present SmallPlan -- a novel framework leveraging LLMs as teacher models to train lightweight Small Language Models (SLMs) for high-level path planning tasks. In SmallPlan, the SLMs provide optimal action sequences to navigate across scene graphs that compactly represent full-scaled 3D scenes. The SLMs are trained in a simulation-powered, interleaved manner with LLM-guided supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). This strategy not only enables SLMs to successfully complete navigation tasks but also makes them aware of important factors like travel distance and number of trials. Through experiments, we demonstrate that the fine-tuned SLMs perform competitively with larger models like GPT-4o on sequential path planning, without suffering from hallucination and overfitting. SmallPlan is resource-efficient, making it well-suited for edge-device deployment and advancing practical autonomous robotics.

      Hallucinations remain a persistent challenge for LLMs. RAG aims to reduce hallucinations by grounding responses in contexts. However, even when provided context, LLMs still frequently introduce unsupported information or contradictions. This paper presents our efforts to measure LLM hallucinations with a focus on summarization tasks, assessing how often various LLMs introduce hallucinations when summarizing documents. We discuss Vectara's existing LLM hallucination leaderboard, based on the Hughes Hallucination Evaluation Model (HHEM). While HHEM and Vectara's Hallucination Leaderboard have garnered great research interest, we examine challenges faced by HHEM and current hallucination detection methods by analyzing the effectiveness of these methods on existing hallucination datasets. To address these limitations, we propose FaithJudge, an LLM-as-a-judge approach guided by few-shot human hallucination annotations, which substantially improves automated LLM hallucination evaluation over current methods. We introduce an enhanced hallucination leaderboard centered on FaithJudge, alongside our current hallucination leaderboard, enabling more reliable benchmarking of LLMs for hallucinations in RAG.

      Intelligent tutoring systems have demonstrated effectiveness in teaching formal propositional logic proofs, but their reliance on template-based explanations limits their ability to provide personalized student feedback. While large language models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for dynamic feedback generation, they risk producing hallucinations or pedagogically unsound explanations. We evaluated the stepwise accuracy of LLMs in constructing multi-step symbolic logic proofs, comparing six prompting techniques across four state-of-the-art LLMs on 358 propositional logic problems. Results show that DeepSeek-V3 achieved superior performance with 84.4% accuracy on stepwise proof construction and excelled particularly in simpler rules. We further used the best-performing LLM to generate explanatory hints for 1,050 unique student problem-solving states from a logic ITS and evaluated them on 4 criteria with both an LLM grader and human expert ratings on a 20% sample. Our analysis finds that LLM-generated hints were 75% accurate and rated highly by human evaluators on consistency and clarity, but did not perform as well explaining why the hint was provided or its larger context. Our results demonstrate that LLMs may be used to augment tutoring systems with logic tutoring hints, but requires additional modifications to ensure accuracy and pedagogical appropriateness.

Existing retrieval methods, including keyword search and document embeddings, can be optimized with domain-specific datasets to improve QBD search performance. However, creating these domain-specific datasets is often costly and time-consuming. Our work introduces a process to generate custom QBD-search datasets and compares a set of methods to use in this problem, which we refer to as QBD-RankedDatagen.

In this work, we propose SOAEsV2-7B/72B, a specialized LLM series developed via a three-phase framework: 1) continual pre-training integrates domain knowledge while retaining base capabilities; 2) domain-progressive SFT employs curriculum-based learning strategy, transitioning from weakly relevant conversational data to expert-annotated SOAEs datasets to optimize domain-specific tasks; 3) distillation-enhanced speculative decoding accelerates inference via logit distillation between 72B target and 7B draft models, achieving 1.39-1.52$\times$ speedup without quality loss. Experimental results demonstrate that our domain-specific pre-training phase maintains 99.8% of original general language capabilities while significantly improving domain performance, resulting in a 1.08$\times$ improvement in Rouge-1 score and a 1.17$\times$ enhancement in BLEU-4 score. Ablation studies further show that domain-progressive SFT outperforms single-stage training, achieving 1.02$\times$ improvement in Rouge-1 and 1.06$\times$ in BLEU-4. Our work introduces a comprehensive, full-pipeline approach for optimizing SOAEs LLMs, bridging the gap between general language capabilities and domain-specific expertise.

      With the increasing popularity of IoT applications, end users demand more personalized and intuitive functionality. A major obstacle for this, however, is that custom IoT functionality today still requires at least some coding skills. To address this, no-code development platforms have been proposed as a solution for empowering non-technical users to create applications. However, such platforms still require a certain level of technical expertise for structuring process steps or defining event-action relations. The advent of LLMs can further enhance no-code platforms by enabling natural language-based interaction, automating of complex tasks, and dynamic code generation. By allowing users to describe their requirements in natural language, LLMs can significantly streamline no-code development. As LLMs vary in performance, architecture, training data used, and the use cases they target, it is still unclear which models are best suited and what are the influence factors determining this fit. In particular, no-code development of IoT applications by non-technical users will have completely different demands on LLMs than, e.g., code generation for more open-ended applications or for supporting professional developers. In this paper, we explore the factors influencing the suitability of LLMs to no-code development of IoT applications. We also examine the role of input prompt language on accuracy and quality of generated applications as well as the influence of LLM training data. By conducting comprehensive experiments with a range of LLMs, we provide valuable insights for optimizing LLM-powered no-code platforms, guiding the selection of the suitable LLMs and their effective application. Our findings contribute to improving the accessibility, efficiency, and user experience of no-code IoT development, ultimately enabling broader adoption of IoT technologies among non-expert users.

      Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) represent a significant advancement in artificial intelligence by integrating image-processing capabilities with textual understanding, thereby enhancing user interactions and expanding application domains. However, their increased complexity introduces novel safety and ethical challenges, particularly in multi-modal and multi-turn conversations. Traditional safety evaluation frameworks, designed for text-based, single-turn interactions, are inadequate for addressing these complexities. To bridge this gap, we introduce the REVEAL (Responsible Evaluation of Vision-Enabled AI LLMs) Framework, a scalable and automated pipeline for evaluating image-input harms in VLLMs. REVEAL includes automated image mining, synthetic adversarial data generation, multi-turn conversational expansion using crescendo attack strategies, and comprehensive harm assessment through evaluators like GPT-4o. We extensively evaluated five state-of-the-art VLLMs, GPT-4o, Llama-3.2, Qwen2-VL, Phi3.5V, and Pixtral, across three important harm categories: sexual harm, violence, and misinformation. Our findings reveal that multi-turn interactions result in significantly higher defect rates compared to single-turn evaluations, highlighting deeper vulnerabilities in VLLMs. Notably, GPT-4o demonstrated the most balanced performance as measured by our Safety-Usability Index (SUI) followed closely by Pixtral. Additionally, misinformation emerged as a critical area requiring enhanced contextual defenses. Llama-3.2 exhibited the highest MT defect rate ($16.55 \%$) while Qwen2-VL showed the highest MT refusal rate ($19.1 \%$).

      With the rise of AI-based code generation, customizing existing code out of natural language instructions to modify visual results -such as figures or images -has become possible, promising to reduce the need for deep programming expertise. However, even experienced developers can struggle with this task, as it requires identifying relevant code regions (feature location), generating valid code variants, and ensuring the modifications reliably align with user intent. In this paper, we introduce vTikZ, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to customize code while preserving coherent visual outcomes. Our benchmark consists of carefully curated vTikZ editing scenarios, parameterized ground truths, and a reviewing tool that leverages visual feedback to assess correctness. Empirical evaluation with stateof-the-art LLMs shows that existing solutions struggle to reliably modify code in alignment with visual intent, highlighting a gap in current AI-assisted code editing approaches. We argue that vTikZ opens new research directions for integrating LLMs with visual feedback mechanisms to improve code customization tasks in various domains beyond TikZ, including image processing, art creation, Web design, and 3D modeling.

      Training fall detection systems is challenging due to the scarcity of real-world fall data, particularly from elderly individuals. To address this, we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating synthetic fall data. This study evaluates text-to-motion (T2M, SATO, ParCo) and text-to-text models (GPT4o, GPT4, Gemini) in simulating realistic fall scenarios. We generate synthetic datasets and integrate them with four real-world baseline datasets to assess their impact on fall detection performance using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. Additionally, we compare LLM-generated synthetic data with a diffusion-based method to evaluate their alignment with real accelerometer distributions. Results indicate that dataset characteristics significantly influence the effectiveness of synthetic data, with LLM-generated data performing best in low-frequency settings (e.g., 20Hz) while showing instability in high-frequency datasets (e.g., 200Hz). While text-to-motion models produce more realistic biomechanical data than text-to-text models, their impact on fall detection varies. Diffusion-based synthetic data demonstrates the closest alignment to real data but does not consistently enhance model performance. An ablation study further confirms that the effectiveness of synthetic data depends on sensor placement and fall representation. These findings provide insights into optimizing synthetic data generation for fall detection models.

      LLM-based agents have demonstrated great potential in generating and managing code within complex codebases. In this paper, we introduce WebGen-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to measure an LLM-based agent's ability to create multi-file website codebases from scratch. It contains diverse instructions for website generation, created through the combined efforts of human annotators and GPT-4o. These instructions span three major categories and thirteen minor categories, encompassing nearly all important types of web applications. To assess the quality of the generated websites, we use GPT-4o to generate test cases targeting each functionality described in the instructions, and then manually filter, adjust, and organize them to ensure accuracy, resulting in 647 test cases. Each test case specifies an operation to be performed on the website and the expected result after the operation. To automate testing and improve reproducibility, we employ a powerful web-navigation agent to execute tests on the generated websites and determine whether the observed responses align with the expected results. We evaluate three high-performance code-agent frameworks, Bolt.diy, OpenHands, and Aider, using multiple proprietary and open-source LLMs as engines. The best-performing combination, Bolt.diy powered by DeepSeek-R1, achieves only 27.8\% accuracy on the test cases, highlighting the challenging nature of our benchmark. Additionally, we construct WebGen-Instruct, a training set consisting of 6,667 website-generation instructions. Training Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct on Bolt.diy trajectories generated from a subset of this training set achieves an accuracy of 38.2\%, surpassing the performance of the best proprietary model.

      Background: Clinical guidelines are central to safe evidence-based medicine in modern healthcare, providing diagnostic criteria, treatment options and monitoring advice for a wide range of illnesses. LLM-empowered chatbots have shown great promise in Healthcare Q&A tasks, offering the potential to provide quick and accurate responses to medical inquiries. Our main objective was the development and preliminary assessment of an LLM-empowered chatbot software capable of reliably answering clinical guideline questions using University College London Hospital (UCLH) clinical guidelines. Methods: We used the open-weight Llama-3.1-8B LLM to extract relevant information from the UCLH guidelines to answer questions. Our approach highlights the safety and reliability of referencing information over its interpretation and response generation. Seven doctors from the ward assessed the chatbot's performance by comparing its answers to the gold standard. Results: Our chatbot demonstrates promising performance in terms of relevance, with ~73% of its responses rated as very relevant, showcasing a strong understanding of the clinical context. Importantly, our chatbot achieves a recall of 1.00 for extracted guideline lines, substantially minimising the risk of missing critical information. Approximately 78% of responses were rated satisfactory in terms of completeness. A small portion (~14.5%) contained minor unnecessary information, indicating occasional lapses in precision. The chatbot' showed high efficiency, with an average completion time of 10 seconds, compared to 30 seconds for human respondents. Evaluation of clinical reasoning showed that 72% of the chatbot's responses were without flaws. Our chatbot demonstrates significant potential to speed up and improve the process of accessing locally relevant clinical information for healthcare professionals.

      While recent advancements in machine learning, such as LLMs, are revolutionizing software development and creative industries, they have had minimal impact on engineers designing mechanical parts, which remains largely a manual process. Existing approaches to generating 3D geometry most commonly use meshes as a 3D representation. While meshes are suitable for assets in video games or animations, they lack sufficient precision and adaptability for mechanical engineering purposes. This paper introduces a novel approach for the generation of 3D geometry that generates surface-based Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) by leveraging a code-generation LLM. First, we create a dataset of 3D mechanical parts represented as code scripts by converting Boundary Representation geometry (BREP) into CSG-based Python scripts. Second, we create annotations in natural language using GPT-4. The resulting dataset is used to fine-tune a code-generation LLM. The fine-tuned LLM can complete geometries based on positional input and natural language in a plausible way, demonstrating geometric understanding.

      The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values remains critical yet hindered by four key challenges: (1) scarcity of balanced safety datasets, (2) alignment tax, (3) vulnerability to jailbreak attacks due to shallow alignment, and (4) inability to dynamically adapt rewards according to task difficulty. To address these limitations, we introduce HAIR (Hardness-Aware Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Introspective Reasoning), a novel alignment approach inspired by shadow models in membership inference attacks. Our approach consists of two main components: (1) construction of a balanced safety Chain-of-Draft (CoD) dataset for seven harmful categories using structured prompts that leverage the introspective reasoning capabilities of LLMs; and (2) training of category-specific reward models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), dynamically tuning optimization to task difficulty at both the data and model levels. Comprehensive experiments across four harmlessness and four usefulness benchmarks demonstrate that HAIR achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming all baseline methods in safety while maintaining high levels of usefulness.

      Sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) large language models (LLMs) are gradually becoming the mainstream approach for ultra-large-scale models. Existing optimization efforts for MoE models have focused primarily on coarse-grained MoE architectures. With the emergence of DeepSeek Models, fine-grained MoE models are gaining popularity, yet research on them remains limited. Therefore, we want to discuss the efficiency dynamic under different service loads. Additionally, fine-grained models allow deployers to reduce the number of routed experts, both activated counts and total counts, raising the question of how this reduction affects the trade-off between MoE efficiency and performance. Our findings indicate that while deploying MoE models presents greater challenges, it also offers significant optimization opportunities. Reducing the number of activated experts can lead to substantial efficiency improvements in certain scenarios, with only minor performance degradation. Reducing the total number of experts provides limited efficiency gains but results in severe performance degradation. Our method can increase throughput by at least 10\% without any performance degradation. Overall, we conclude that MoE inference optimization remains an area with substantial potential for exploration and improvement.

      Arena-based evaluation is a fundamental yet significant evaluation paradigm for modern AI models, especially large language models (LLMs). Existing framework based on ELO rating system suffers from the inevitable instability problem due to ranking inconsistency and the lack of attention to the varying abilities of annotators. In this paper, we introduce a novel stable arena framework to address these issues by enhancing the ELO Rating System. Specifically, we replace the iterative update method with a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) approach, m-ELO, and provide theoretical proof of the consistency and stability of the MLE approach for model ranking. Additionally, we proposed the am-ELO, which modify the Elo Rating's probability function to incorporate annotator abilities, enabling the simultaneous estimation of model scores and annotator reliability. Experiments demonstrate that this method ensures stability, proving that this framework offers a more robust, accurate, and stable evaluation method for LLMs.

      Entity Linking (EL) plays a crucial role in Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, enabling the disambiguation of entity mentions by linking them to their corresponding entries in a reference knowledge base (KB). Thanks to their deep contextual understanding capabilities, LLMs offer a new perspective to tackle EL, promising better results than traditional methods. Despite the impressive generalization capabilities of LLMs, linking less popular, long-tail entities remains challenging as these entities are often underrepresented in training data and knowledge bases. Furthermore, the long-tail EL task is an understudied problem, and limited studies address it with LLMs. In the present work, we assess the performance of two popular LLMs, GPT and LLama3, in a long-tail entity linking scenario. Using MHERCL v0.1, a manually annotated benchmark of sentences from domain-specific historical texts, we quantitatively compare the performance of LLMs in identifying and linking entities to their corresponding Wikidata entries against that of ReLiK, a state-of-the-art Entity Linking and Relation Extraction framework. Our preliminary experiments reveal that LLMs perform encouragingly well in long-tail EL, indicating that this technology can be a valuable adjunct in filling the gap between head and long-tail EL.

      With the involvement of multiple programming languages in modern software development, cross-lingual code clone detection has gained traction within the software engineering community. Numerous studies have explored this topic, proposing various promising approaches. Inspired by the significant advances in machine learning in recent years, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), which have demonstrated their ability to tackle various tasks, this paper revisits cross-lingual code clone detection. We evaluate the performance of five (05) LLMs and eight prompts (08) for the identification of cross-lingual code clones. Additionally, we compare these results against two baseline methods. Finally, we evaluate a pre-trained embedding model to assess the effectiveness of the generated representations for classifying clone and non-clone pairs. The studies involving LLMs and Embedding models are evaluated using two widely used cross-lingual datasets, XLCoST and CodeNet. Our results show that LLMs can achieve high F1 scores, up to 0.99, for straightforward programming examples. However, they not only perform less well on programs associated with complex programming challenges but also do not necessarily understand the meaning of "code clones" in a cross-lingual setting. We show that embedding models used to represent code fragments from different programming languages in the same representation space enable the training of a basic classifier that outperforms all LLMs by ~1 and ~20 percentage points on the XLCoST and CodeNet datasets, respectively. This finding suggests that, despite the apparent capabilities of LLMs, embeddings provided by embedding models offer suitable representations to achieve state-of-the-art performance in cross-lingual code clone detection.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a landmark achievement in Artificial Intelligence (AI), demonstrating unprecedented proficiency in procedural tasks such as text generation, code completion, and conversational coherence. These capabilities stem from their architecture, which mirrors human procedural memory -- the brain's ability to automate repetitive, pattern-driven tasks through practice. However, as LLMs are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, it becomes impossible to ignore their limitations operating in complex, unpredictable environments. This paper argues that LLMs, while transformative, are fundamentally constrained by their reliance on procedural memory. To create agents capable of navigating ``wicked'' learning environments -- where rules shift, feedback is ambiguous, and novelty is the norm -- we must augment LLMs with semantic memory and associative learning systems. By adopting a modular architecture that decouples these cognitive functions, we can bridge the gap between narrow procedural expertise and the adaptive intelligence required for real-world problem-solving.

QLoRA facilitates notable parameter efficiency and memory optimization, preserving the integrity of medical information through specialized quantization techniques. Our research also shows that our model performs relatively well on various medical benchmarks, indicating that it can be used to make basic medical suggestions. This paper details the system's technical components, including its architecture, quantization methods, and key healthcare applications such as enhanced disease prediction from patient symptoms and medical history, treatment suggestions, and efficient summarization of complex medical reports. We touch on the ethical considerations-patient privacy, data security, and the need for rigorous clinical validation-as well as the practical challenges of integrating such systems into real-world healthcare workflows. Furthermore, the lightweight quantized weights ensure scalability and ease of deployment even in low-resource hospital environments.

      The swift spread of fake news and disinformation campaigns poses a significant threat to public trust, political stability, and cybersecurity. Traditional Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) approaches, which rely on low-level indicators such as domain names and social media handles, are easily evaded by adversaries who frequently modify their online infrastructure. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel CTI framework that focuses on high-level, semantic indicators derived from recurrent narratives and relationships of disinformation campaigns. Our approach extracts structured CTI indicators from unstructured disinformation content, capturing key entities and their contextual dependencies within fake news using Large Language Models (LLMs). We further introduce FakeCTI, the first dataset that systematically links fake news to disinformation campaigns and threat actors. To evaluate the effectiveness of our CTI framework, we analyze multiple fake news attribution techniques, spanning from traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) to fine-tuned LLMs. This work shifts the focus from low-level artifacts to persistent conceptual structures, establishing a scalable and adaptive approach to tracking and countering disinformation campaigns.

Both methods integrate seamlessly with existing LLMs to ensure in-domain recommendations. Comprehensive experiments on three recommendation datasets demonstrate that RecLM-cgen consistently outperforms RecLM-ret and existing LLM-based recommender models in accuracy while eliminating OOD recommendations, making it the preferred method for adoption. Additionally, RecLM-cgen maintains strong generalist capabilities and is a lightweight plug-and-play module for easy integration into LLMs, offering valuable practical benefits for the community.

      Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in providing scalable mental health support, while evaluating their counseling capability remains crucial to ensure both efficacy and safety. Existing evaluations are limited by the static assessment that focuses on knowledge tests, the single perspective that centers on user experience, and the open-loop framework that lacks actionable feedback. To address these issues, we propose {\Psi}-Arena, an interactive framework for comprehensive assessment and optimization of LLM-based counselors, featuring three key characteristics: (1) Realistic arena interactions that simulate real-world counseling through multi-stage dialogues with psychologically profiled NPC clients, (2) Tripartite evaluation that integrates assessments from the client, counselor, and supervisor perspectives, and (3) Closed-loop optimization that iteratively improves LLM counselors using diagnostic feedback. Experiments across eight state-of-the-art LLMs show significant performance variations in different real-world scenarios and evaluation perspectives. Moreover, reflection-based optimization results in up to a 141% improvement in counseling performance. We hope PsychoArena provides a foundational resource for advancing reliable and human-aligned LLM applications in mental healthcare.

Through interviews with CHWs and their supervisors and log analysis, we examine factors affecting their engagement with ASHABot, and ASHABot's role in addressing CHWs' informational needs. We found that ASHABot provided a private channel for CHWs to ask rudimentary and sensitive questions they hesitated to ask supervisors. CHWs trusted the information they received on ASHABot and treated it as an authoritative resource. CHWs' supervisors expanded their knowledge by contributing answers to questions ASHABot failed to answer, but were concerned about demands on their workload and increased accountability. We emphasize positioning LLMs as supplemental fallible resources within the community healthcare ecosystem, instead of as replacements for supervisor support.

      Large language models (LLMs) struggle to effectively utilize a growing number of external tools, such as those defined by the Model Context Protocol (MCP)\cite{IntroducingMCP}, due to prompt bloat and selection complexity. We introduce RAG-MCP, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework that overcomes this challenge by offloading tool discovery. RAG-MCP uses semantic retrieval to identify the most relevant MCP(s) for a given query from an external index before engaging the LLM. Only the selected tool descriptions are passed to the model, drastically reducing prompt size and simplifying decision-making. Experiments, including an MCP stress test, demonstrate RAG-MCP significantly cuts prompt tokens (e.g., by over 50%) and more than triples tool selection accuracy (43.13% vs 13.62% baseline) on benchmark tasks. RAG-MCP enables scalable and accurate tool integration for LLMs.

      Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) for large language model (LLM) fine-tuning show promise in addressing multi-objective tasks but still face significant challenges, including complex objective balancing, low training efficiency, poor scalability, and limited explainability. Leveraging ensemble learning principles, we introduce an Ensemble Multi-Objective RL (EMORL) framework that fine-tunes multiple models with individual objectives while optimizing their aggregation after the training to improve efficiency and flexibility. Our method is the first to aggregate the last hidden states of individual models, incorporating contextual information from multiple objectives. This approach is supported by a hierarchical grid search algorithm that identifies optimal weighted combinations. We evaluate EMORL on counselor reflection generation tasks, using text-scoring LLMs to evaluate the generations and provide rewards during RL fine-tuning. Through comprehensive experiments on the PAIR and Psych8k datasets, we demonstrate the advantages of EMORL against existing baselines: significantly lower and more stable training consumption ($17,529\pm 1,650$ data points and $6,573\pm 147.43$ seconds), improved scalability and explainability, and comparable performance across multiple objectives.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong potential across a variety of tasks in communications and networking due to their advanced reasoning capabilities. However, because different LLMs have different model structures and are trained using distinct corpora and methods, they may offer varying optimization strategies for the same network issues. Moreover, the limitations of an individual LLM's training data, aggravated by the potential maliciousness of its hosting device, can result in responses with low confidence or even bias. To address these challenges, we propose a blockchain-enabled collaborative framework that connects multiple LLMs into a Trustworthy Multi-LLM Network (MultiLLMN). This architecture enables the cooperative evaluation and selection of the most reliable and high-quality responses to complex network optimization problems. Specifically, we begin by reviewing related work and highlighting the limitations of existing LLMs in collaboration and trust, emphasizing the need for trustworthiness in LLM-based systems. We then introduce the workflow and design of the proposed Trustworthy MultiLLMN framework. Given the severity of False Base Station (FBS) attacks in B5G and 6G communication systems and the difficulty of addressing such threats through traditional modeling techniques, we present FBS defense as a case study to empirically validate the effectiveness of our approach. Finally, we outline promising future research directions in this emerging area.

      This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can function as intelligent collaborators to bridge expertise gaps in cybersecurity decision-making. We examine two representative tasks-phishing email detection and intrusion detection-that differ in data modality, cognitive complexity, and user familiarity. Through a controlled mixed-methods user study, n = 58 (phishing, n = 34; intrusion, n = 24), we find that human-AI collaboration improves task performance,reducing false positives in phishing detection and false negatives in intrusion detection. A learning effect is also observed when participants transition from collaboration to independent work, suggesting that LLMs can support long-term skill development. Our qualitative analysis shows that interaction dynamics-such as LLM definitiveness, explanation style, and tone-influence user trust, prompting strategies, and decision revision. Users engaged in more analytic questioning and showed greater reliance on LLM feedback in high-complexity settings. These results provide design guidance for building interpretable, adaptive, and trustworthy human-AI teaming systems, and demonstrate that LLMs can meaningfully support non-experts in reasoning through complex cybersecurity problems.

      Neurosymbolic approaches integrating large language models with formal reasoning have recently achieved human-level performance on mathematics competition problems in algebra, geometry and number theory. In comparison, combinatorics remains a challenging domain, characterized by a lack of appropriate benchmarks and theorem libraries. To address this gap, we introduce CombiBench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 100 combinatorial problems, each formalized in Lean~4 and paired with its corresponding informal statement. The problem set covers a wide spectrum of difficulty levels, ranging from middle school to IMO and university level, and span over ten combinatorial topics. CombiBench is suitable for testing IMO solving capabilities since it includes all IMO combinatorial problems since 2000 (except IMO 2004 P3 as its statement contain an images). Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive and standardized evaluation framework, dubbed Fine-Eval (for $\textbf{F}$ill-in-the-blank $\textbf{in}$ L$\textbf{e}$an Evaluation), for formal mathematics. It accommodates not only proof-based problems but also, for the first time, the evaluation of fill-in-the-blank questions. Using Fine-Eval as the evaluation method and Kimina Lean Server as the backend, we benchmark several LLMs on CombiBench and observe that their capabilities for formally solving combinatorial problems remain limited. Among all models tested (none of which has been trained for this particular task), Kimina-Prover attains the best results, solving 7 problems (out of 100) under both ``with solution'' and ``without solution'' scenarios. We open source the benchmark dataset alongside with the code of the proposed evaluation method at https://github.com/MoonshotAI/CombiBench/.

      Recently emerged 6G space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs), which integrate satellites, aerial networks, and terrestrial communications, offer ubiquitous coverage for various mobile applications. However, the highly dynamic, open, and heterogeneous nature of SAGINs poses severe security issues. Forming a defense line of SAGINs suffers from two preliminary challenges: 1) accurately understanding massive unstructured multi-dimensional threat information to generate defense strategies against various malicious attacks, 2) rapidly adapting to potential unknown threats to yield more effective security strategies. To tackle the above two challenges, we propose a novel security framework for SAGINs based on Large Language Models (LLMs), which consists of two key ingredients LLM-6GNG and 6G-INST. Our proposed LLM-6GNG leverages refined chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and dynamic multi-agent mechanisms to analyze massive unstructured multi-dimensional threat data and generate comprehensive security strategies, thus addressing the first challenge. Our proposed 6G-INST relies on a novel self-evolving method to automatically update LLM-6GNG, enabling it to accommodate unknown threats under dynamic communication environments, thereby addressing the second challenge. Additionally, we prototype the proposed framework with ns-3, OpenAirInterface (OAI), and software-defined radio (SDR). Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. The results show that our framework produces highly accurate security strategies that remain robust against a variety of unknown attacks. We will release our code to contribute to the community.

      In the context where social media emerges as a pivotal platform for social movements and shaping public opinion, accurately simulating and predicting the dynamics of user opinions is of significant importance. Such insights are vital for understanding social phenomena, informing policy decisions, and guiding public opinion. Unfortunately, traditional algorithms based on idealized models and disregarding social data often fail to capture the complexity and nuance of real-world social interactions. This study proposes the Fusing Dynamics Equation-Large Language Model (FDE-LLM) algorithm. This innovative approach aligns the actions and evolution of opinions in Large Language Models (LLMs) with the real-world data on social networks. The FDE-LLM devides users into two roles: opinion leaders and followers. Opinion leaders use LLM for role-playing and employ Cellular Automata(CA) to constrain opinion changes. In contrast, opinion followers are integrated into a dynamic system that combines the CA model with the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model. This innovative design significantly improves the accuracy of the simulation. Our experiments utilized four real-world datasets from Weibo. The result demonstrates that the FDE-LLM significantly outperforms traditional Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) algorithms and LLM-based algorithms. Additionally, our algorithm accurately simulates the decay and recovery of opinions over time, underscoring LLMs potential to revolutionize the understanding of social media dynamics.

      Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) is critical for efficient spectrum management and robust wireless communications. However, AMC remains challenging due to the complex interplay of signal interference and noise. In this work, we propose an innovative framework that integrates traditional signal processing techniques with Large-Language Models (LLMs) to address AMC. Our approach leverages higher-order statistics and cumulant estimation to convert quantitative signal features into structured natural language prompts. By incorporating exemplar contexts into these prompts, our method exploits the LLM's inherent familiarity with classical signal processing, enabling effective one-shot classification without additional training or preprocessing (e.g., denoising). Experimental evaluations on synthetically generated datasets, spanning both noiseless and noisy conditions, demonstrate that our framework achieves competitive performance across diverse modulation schemes and Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs). Moreover, our approach paves the way for robust foundation models in wireless communications across varying channel conditions, significantly reducing the expense associated with developing channel-specific models. This work lays the foundation for scalable, interpretable, and versatile signal classification systems in next-generation wireless networks.

Inspired by the NIST Computer Forensic Tool Testing Program, this paper proposes a standardized methodology to quantitatively evaluate the application of LLMs for digital forensic tasks, specifically in timeline analysis. The paper describes the components of the methodology, including the dataset, timeline generation, and ground truth development. Additionally, the paper recommends using BLEU and ROUGE metrics for the quantitative evaluation of LLMs through case studies or tasks involving timeline analysis. Experimental results using ChatGPT demonstrate that the proposed methodology can effectively evaluate LLM-based forensic timeline analysis.

      Differential testing can be an effective way to find bugs in software systems with multiple implementations that conform to the same specification, like compilers, network protocol parsers, or language runtimes. Specifications for such systems are often standardized in natural language documents, like Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) specifications or IETF RFC's. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in both generating tests and handling large volumes of natural language text, making them well-suited for analyzing artifacts like specification documents, bug reports, and code implementations. In this work, we leverage natural language and code artifacts to guide LLMs to generate targeted tests that highlight meaningful behavioral differences between implementations, including those corresponding to bugs. We introduce DiffSpec, a framework for generating differential tests with LLMs using prompt chaining. We demonstrate DiffSpec's efficacy on two different (extensively tested) systems, eBPF runtimes and Wasm validators. Using DiffSpec, we generated 1901 differentiating tests, uncovering at least four distinct and confirmed bugs in eBPF, including a kernel memory leak, inconsistent behavior in jump instructions, undefined behavior when using the stack pointer, and tests with infinite loops that hang the verifier in ebpf-for-windows.

      Autonomous control systems face significant challenges in performing complex tasks in the presence of latent risks. To address this, we propose an integrated framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs), numerical optimization, and optimization-based control to facilitate efficient subtask learning while ensuring safety against latent risks. The framework decomposes complex tasks into a sequence of context-aware subtasks that account for latent risks. These subtasks and their parameters are then refined through a multi-time-scale process: high-layer multi-turn in-context learning, mid-layer LLM Chain-of-Thought reasoning and numerical optimization, and low-layer model predictive control. The framework iteratively improves decisions by leveraging qualitative feedback and optimized trajectory data from lower-layer optimization processes and a physics simulator. We validate the proposed framework through simulated case studies involving robot arm and autonomous vehicle scenarios. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework can mediate actions based on the context and latent risks and learn complex behaviors efficiently.

      Serving large language models (LLMs) is expensive, especially for providers hosting many models, making cost reduction essential. The unique workload patterns of serving multiple LLMs (i.e., multi-LLM serving) create new opportunities and challenges for this task. The long-tail popularity of models and their long idle periods present opportunities to improve utilization through GPU sharing. However, existing GPU sharing systems lack the ability to adjust their resource allocation and sharing policies at runtime, making them ineffective at meeting latency service-level objectives (SLOs) under rapidly fluctuating workloads. This paper presents Prism, a multi-LLM serving system that unleashes the full potential of GPU sharing to achieve both cost efficiency and SLO attainment. At its core, Prism tackles a key limitation of existing systems$\unicode{x2014}$the lack of $\textit{cross-model memory coordination}$, which is essential for flexibly sharing GPU memory across models under dynamic workloads. Prism achieves this with two key designs. First, it supports on-demand memory allocation by dynamically mapping physical to virtual memory pages, allowing flexible memory redistribution among models that space- and time-share a GPU. Second, it improves memory efficiency through a two-level scheduling policy that dynamically adjusts sharing strategies based on models' runtime demands. Evaluations on real-world traces show that Prism achieves more than $2\times$ cost savings and $3.3\times$ SLO attainment compared to state-of-the-art systems.

This paper introduces QROA, a novel black-box jailbreak method designed to identify adversarial suffixes that can bypass LLM alignment safeguards when appended to a malicious instruction. Unlike existing suffix-based jailbreak approaches, QROA does not require access to the model's logit or any other internal information. It also eliminates reliance on human-crafted templates, operating solely through the standard query-response interface of LLMs. By framing the attack as an optimization bandit problem, QROA employs a surrogate model and token level optimization to efficiently explore suffix variations. Furthermore, we propose QROA-UNV, an extension that identifies universal adversarial suffixes for individual models, enabling one-query jailbreaks across a wide range of instructions. Testing on multiple models demonstrates Attack Success Rate (ASR) greater than 80\%.

This study explores whether such narratives can similarly nudge LLM agents toward collaboration. We use a finitely repeated public goods game in which LLM agents choose either cooperative or egoistic spending strategies. We prime agents with stories highlighting teamwork to different degrees and test how this influences negotiation outcomes. Our experiments explore four questions:(1) How do narratives influence negotiation behavior? (2) What differs when agents share the same story versus different ones? (3) What happens when the agent numbers grow? (4) Are agents resilient against self-serving negotiators? We find that story-based priming significantly affects negotiation strategies and success rates. Common stories improve collaboration, benefiting each agent. By contrast, priming agents with different stories reverses this effect, and those agents primed toward self-interest prevail. We hypothesize that these results carry implications for multi-agent system design and AI alignment.

      Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse tasks by encoding vast amounts of factual knowledge. However, they are still prone to hallucinations, generating incorrect or misleading information, often accompanied by high uncertainty. Existing methods for hallucination detection primarily focus on quantifying internal uncertainty, which arises from missing or conflicting knowledge within the model. However, hallucinations can also stem from external uncertainty, where ambiguous user queries lead to multiple possible interpretations. In this work, we introduce Semantic Volume, a novel mathematical measure for quantifying both external and internal uncertainty in LLMs. Our approach perturbs queries and responses, embeds them in a semantic space, and computes the determinant of the Gram matrix of the embedding vectors, capturing their dispersion as a measure of uncertainty. Our framework provides a generalizable and unsupervised uncertainty detection method without requiring internal access to LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on both external and internal uncertainty detection, demonstrating that our Semantic Volume method consistently outperforms existing baselines in both tasks. Additionally, we provide theoretical insights linking our measure to differential entropy, unifying and extending previous sampling-based uncertainty measures such as the semantic entropy. Semantic Volume is shown to be a robust and interpretable approach to improving the reliability of LLMs by systematically detecting uncertainty in both user queries and model responses.

We introduce S-GRPO, a stochastic variant of Group Relative Policy Optimization, and T-SPMO, a token-level prefix matching approach for fine-grained credit assignment.

Surprisingly, full-token GRPO under LoRA fails to improve over the base model, suggesting that selective token-level optimization may act as an implicit regularizer in low-parameter training regimes.

      The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has predominantly focused on high-resource languages, leaving low-resource languages, such as those in the Finno-Ugric family, significantly underrepresented. This paper addresses this gap by focusing on V\~oro, Livonian, and Komi. We cover almost the entire cycle of LLM creation, from data collection to instruction tuning and evaluation. Our contributions include developing multilingual base and instruction-tuned models; creating evaluation benchmarks, including the smugri-MT-bench multi-turn conversational benchmark; and conducting human evaluation. We intend for this work to promote linguistic diversity, ensuring that lesser-resourced languages can benefit from advancements in NLP.

      Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities across general domains, their effectiveness in real-world clinical practice remains limited. This is likely due to their insufficient exposure to real-world clinical data during training, as such data is typically not included due to privacy concerns. To address this, we propose enhancing the clinical reasoning capabilities of LLMs by leveraging real-world clinical data. We constructed reasoning-intensive questions from a nationwide sepsis registry and fine-tuned Phi-4 on these questions using reinforcement learning, resulting in C-Reason. C-Reason exhibited strong clinical reasoning capabilities on the in-domain test set, as evidenced by both quantitative metrics and expert evaluations. Furthermore, its enhanced reasoning capabilities generalized to a sepsis dataset involving different tasks and patient cohorts, an open-ended consultations on antibiotics use task, and other diseases. Future research should focus on training LLMs with large-scale, multi-disease clinical datasets to develop more powerful, general-purpose clinical reasoning models.
