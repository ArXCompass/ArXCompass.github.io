      Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable capabilities but remain vulnerable to adversarial prompts known as jailbreaks, which can bypass safety alignment and elicit harmful outputs. Despite growing efforts in LLM safety research, existing evaluations are often fragmented, focused on isolated attack or defense techniques, and lack systematic, reproducible analysis. In this work, we introduce PandaGuard, a unified and modular framework that models LLM jailbreak safety as a multi-agent system comprising attackers, defenders, and judges. Our framework implements 19 attack methods and 12 defense mechanisms, along with multiple judgment strategies, all within a flexible plugin architecture supporting diverse LLM interfaces, multiple interaction modes, and configuration-driven experimentation that enhances reproducibility and practical deployment. Built on this framework, we develop PandaBench, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates the interactions between these attack/defense methods across 49 LLMs and various judgment approaches, requiring over 3 billion tokens to execute. Our extensive evaluation reveals key insights into model vulnerabilities, defense cost-performance trade-offs, and judge consistency. We find that no single defense is optimal across all dimensions and that judge disagreement introduces nontrivial variance in safety assessments. We release the code, configurations, and evaluation results to support transparent and reproducible research in LLM safety.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Although large language models (LLMs) perform well in general tasks, domain-specific applications suffer from hallucinations and accuracy limitations. Continual Pre-Training (CPT) approaches encounter two key issues: (1) domain-biased data degrades general language skills, and (2) improper corpus-mixture ratios limit effective adaptation. To address these, we propose a novel framework, Mixture of Losses (MoL), which decouples optimization objectives for domain-specific and general corpora. Specifically, cross-entropy (CE) loss is applied to domain-corpus to ensure knowledge acquisition, while Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence aligns general-corpus training with the base model's foundational capabilities. This dual-loss architecture preserves universal skills while enhancing domain expertise, avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Empirically, we validate that a 1:1 domain-to-general corpus ratio optimally balances training and overfitting without the need for extensive tuning or resource-intensive experiments. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate significant performance gains compared to traditional CPT approaches, which often suffer from degradation in general language capabilities; our model achieves 27.9% higher accuracy on the Math-500 benchmark in the non-think reasoning mode, and an impressive 83.3% improvement on the challenging AIME25 subset in the think mode, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach.

      Scaling large language models (LLMs) has driven significant advancements, yet it faces diminishing returns and escalating energy demands. This work introduces test-time compute (TTC)-allocating additional computational resources during inference-as a compelling complement to conventional scaling strategies. Specifically, we investigate whether employing TTC can achieve superior accuracy-energy trade-offs compared to simply increasing model size. Our empirical analysis reveals that TTC surpasses traditional model scaling in accuracy/energy efficiency, with notable gains in tasks demanding complex reasoning rather than mere factual recall. Further, we identify a critical interaction between TTC performance and output sequence length, demonstrating that strategically adjusting compute resources at inference time according to query complexity can substantially enhance efficiency. Our findings advocate for TTC as a promising direction, enabling more sustainable, accurate, and adaptable deployment of future language models without incurring additional pretraining costs.

      We introduce WellPlay, a reasoning dataset for multi-agent conversational inference in Murder Mystery Games (MMGs). WellPlay comprises 1,482 inferential questions across 12 games, spanning objectives, reasoning, and relationship understanding, and establishes a systematic benchmark for evaluating agent reasoning abilities in complex social settings. Building on this foundation, we present PLAYER*, a novel framework for Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents in MMGs. MMGs pose unique challenges, including undefined state spaces, absent intermediate rewards, and the need for strategic reasoning through natural language. PLAYER* addresses these challenges with a sensor-based state representation and an information-driven strategy that optimises questioning and suspect pruning. Experiments show that PLAYER* outperforms existing methods in reasoning accuracy, efficiency, and agent-human interaction, advancing reasoning agents for complex social scenarios.

      In light of the rapid adoption of AI coding assistants, LLM-assisted development has become increasingly prevalent, creating an urgent need for robust evaluation of generated code quality. Existing benchmarks often require extensive manual effort to create static datasets, rely on indirect or insufficiently challenging tasks, depend on non-scalable ground truth, or neglect critical low-level security evaluations, particularly memory-safety issues. In this work, we introduce OSS-Bench, a benchmark generator that automatically constructs large-scale, live evaluation tasks from real-world open-source software. OSS-Bench replaces functions with LLM-generated code and evaluates them using three natural metrics: compilability, functional correctness, and memory safety, leveraging robust signals like compilation failures, test-suite violations, and sanitizer alerts as ground truth. In our evaluation, the benchmark, instantiated as OSS-Bench(php) and OSS-Bench(sql), profiles 17 diverse LLMs, revealing insights such as intra-family behavioral patterns and inconsistencies between model size and performance. Our results demonstrate that OSS-Bench mitigates overfitting by leveraging the evolving complexity of OSS and highlights LLMs' limited understanding of low-level code security via extended fuzzing experiments. Overall, OSS-Bench offers a practical and scalable framework for benchmarking the real-world coding capabilities of LLMs.

      Large language model (LLM) based zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) methods tend to preserve the acoustic environment of the audio prompt, leading to degradation in synthesized speech quality when the audio prompt contains noise. In this paper, we propose a novel neural codec-based speech denoiser and integrate it with the advanced LLM-based TTS model, LauraTTS, to achieve noise-robust zero-shot TTS. The proposed codec denoiser consists of an audio codec, a token denoiser, and an embedding refiner. The token denoiser predicts the first two groups of clean acoustic tokens from the noisy ones, which can serve as the acoustic prompt for LauraTTS to synthesize high-quality personalized speech or be converted to clean speech waveforms through the embedding refiner and codec decoder. Experimental results show that our proposed codec denoiser outperforms state-of-the-art speech enhancement (SE) methods, and the proposed noise-robust LauraTTS surpasses the approach using additional SE models.

      Large language models (LLMs) can leak sensitive training data through memorization and membership inference attacks. Prior work has primarily focused on strong adversarial assumptions, including attacker access to entire samples or long, ordered prefixes, leaving open the question of how vulnerable LLMs are when adversaries have only partial, unordered sample information. For example, if an attacker knows a patient has "hypertension," under what conditions can they query a model fine-tuned on patient data to learn the patient also has "osteoarthritis?" In this paper, we introduce a more general threat model under this weaker assumption and show that fine-tuned LLMs are susceptible to these fragment-specific extraction attacks. To systematically investigate these attacks, we propose two data-blind methods: (1) a likelihood ratio attack inspired by methods from membership inference, and (2) a novel approach, PRISM, which regularizes the ratio by leveraging an external prior. Using examples from both medical and legal settings, we show that both methods are competitive with a data-aware baseline classifier that assumes access to labeled in-distribution data, underscoring their robustness.

      Inference scaling empowers LLMs with unprecedented reasoning ability, with reinforcement learning as the core technique to elicit complex reasoning. However, key technical details of state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs are concealed (such as in OpenAI o1 blog and DeepSeek R1 technical report), thus the community still struggles to reproduce their RL training results. We propose the $\textbf{D}$ecoupled Clip and $\textbf{D}$ynamic s$\textbf{A}$mpling $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{DAPO}$) algorithm, and fully open-source a state-of-the-art large-scale RL system that achieves 50 points on AIME 2024 using Qwen2.5-32B base model. Unlike previous works that withhold training details, we introduce four key techniques of our algorithm that make large-scale LLM RL a success. In addition, we open-source our training code, which is built on the verl framework, along with a carefully curated and processed dataset. These components of our open-source system enhance reproducibility and support future research in large-scale LLM RL.

      Evaluating ecological time series is critical for benchmarking model performance in many important applications, including predicting greenhouse gas fluxes, capturing carbon-nitrogen dynamics, and monitoring hydrological cycles. Traditional numerical metrics (e.g., R-squared, root mean square error) have been widely used to quantify the similarity between modeled and observed ecosystem variables, but they often fail to capture domain-specific temporal patterns critical to ecological processes. As a result, these methods are often accompanied by expert visual inspection, which requires substantial human labor and limits the applicability to large-scale evaluation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that integrates metric learning with large language model (LLM)-based natural language policy extraction to develop interpretable evaluation criteria. The proposed method processes pairwise annotations and implements a policy optimization mechanism to generate and combine different assessment metrics. The results obtained on multiple datasets for evaluating the predictions of crop gross primary production and carbon dioxide flux have confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method in capturing target assessment preferences, including both synthetically generated and expert-annotated model comparisons. The proposed framework bridges the gap between numerical metrics and expert knowledge while providing interpretable evaluation policies that accommodate the diverse needs of different ecosystem modeling studies.

      The pursuit of alpha returns that exceed market benchmarks has undergone a profound transformation, evolving from intuition-driven investing to autonomous, AI powered systems. This paper introduces a comprehensive five stage taxonomy that traces this progression across manual strategies, statistical models, classical machine learning, deep learning, and agentic architectures powered by large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior surveys focused narrowly on modeling techniques, this review adopts a system level lens, integrating advances in representation learning, multimodal data fusion, and tool augmented LLM agents. The strategic shift from static predictors to contextaware financial agents capable of real time reasoning, scenario simulation, and cross modal decision making is emphasized. Key challenges in interpretability, data fragility, governance, and regulatory compliance areas critical to production deployment are examined. The proposed taxonomy offers a unified framework for evaluating maturity, aligning infrastructure, and guiding the responsible development of next generation alpha systems.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), significantly enhancing their reasoning abilities in domains such as mathematics and code generation. A crucial factor influencing RL fine-tuning success is the training curriculum: the order in which training problems are presented. While random curricula serve as common baselines, they remain suboptimal; manually designed curricula often rely heavily on heuristics, and online filtering methods can be computationally prohibitive. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Evolving Curriculum (SEC), an automatic curriculum learning method that learns a curriculum policy concurrently with the RL fine-tuning process. Our approach formulates curriculum selection as a non-stationary Multi-Armed Bandit problem, treating each problem category (e.g., difficulty level or problem type) as an individual arm. We leverage the absolute advantage from policy gradient methods as a proxy measure for immediate learning gain. At each training step, the curriculum policy selects categories to maximize this reward signal and is updated using the TD(0) method. Across three distinct reasoning domains: planning, inductive reasoning, and mathematics, our experiments demonstrate that SEC significantly improves models' reasoning capabilities, enabling better generalization to harder, out-of-distribution test problems. Additionally, our approach achieves better skill balance when fine-tuning simultaneously on multiple reasoning domains. These findings highlight SEC as a promising strategy for RL fine-tuning of LLMs.

      Although the context length of large language models (LLMs) has increased to millions of tokens, evaluating their effectiveness beyond needle-in-a-haystack approaches has proven difficult. We argue that novels provide a case study of subtle, complicated structure and long-range semantic dependencies often over 128k tokens in length. Inspired by work on computational novel analysis, we release the Too Long, Didn't Model (TLDM) benchmark, which tests a model's ability to report plot summary, storyworld configuration, and elapsed narrative time. We find that none of seven tested frontier LLMs retain stable understanding beyond 64k tokens. Our results suggest language model developers must look beyond "lost in the middle" benchmarks when evaluating model performance in complex long-context scenarios. To aid in further development we release the TLDM benchmark together with reference code and data.

      This study introduces a framework for evaluating consistency in large language model (LLM) binary text classification, addressing the lack of established reliability assessment methods. Adapting psychometric principles, we determine sample size requirements, develop metrics for invalid responses, and evaluate intra- and inter-rater reliability. Our case study examines financial news sentiment classification across 14 LLMs (including claude-3-7-sonnet, gpt-4o, deepseek-r1, gemma3, llama3.2, phi4, and command-r-plus), with five replicates per model on 1,350 articles. Models demonstrated high intra-rater consistency, achieving perfect agreement on 90-98% of examples, with minimal differences between expensive and economical models from the same families. When validated against StockNewsAPI labels, models achieved strong performance (accuracy 0.76-0.88), with smaller models like gemma3:1B, llama3.2:3B, and claude-3-5-haiku outperforming larger counterparts. All models performed at chance when predicting actual market movements, indicating task constraints rather than model limitations. Our framework provides systematic guidance for LLM selection, sample size planning, and reliability assessment, enabling organizations to optimize resources for classification tasks.

      While large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential across various domains, their applications in robotics remain largely limited to static, prompt-based behaviors and still face challenges in handling complex tasks under zero-shot or few-shot settings. Inspired by human metacognitive learning and creative problem-solving, we address this limitation by exploring a fundamental research question: Can LLMs be empowered with metacognitive capabilities to reason, reflect, and create, thereby enhancing their ability to perform robotic tasks with minimal demonstrations? In this paper, we present an early-stage framework that integrates metacognitive learning into LLM-powered multi-robot collaboration. The proposed framework equips the LLM-powered robotic agents with a skill decomposition and self-reflection mechanism that identifies modular skills from prior tasks, reflects on failures in unseen task scenarios, and synthesizes effective new solutions. Experimental results show that our metacognitive-learning-empowered LLM framework significantly outperforms existing baselines. Moreover, we observe that the framework is capable of generating solutions that differ from the ground truth yet still successfully complete the tasks. These exciting findings support our hypothesis that metacognitive learning can foster creativity in robotic planning.

      Large language models (LLMs) are known to perpetuate stereotypes and exhibit biases. Various strategies have been proposed to mitigate these biases, but most work studies biases in LLMs as a black-box problem without considering how concepts are represented within the model. We adapt techniques from representation engineering to study how the concept of "gender" is represented within LLMs. We introduce a new method that extracts concept representations via probability weighting without labeled data and efficiently selects a steering vector for measuring and manipulating the model's representation. We also present a projection-based method that enables precise steering of model predictions and demonstrate its effectiveness in mitigating gender bias in LLMs. Our code is available at: https://github.com/hannahxchen/gender-bias-steering

      Accelerating large language model (LLM) inference is critical for real-world deployments requiring high throughput and low latency. Contextual sparsity, where each token dynamically activates only a small subset of the model parameters, shows promise but does not scale to large batch sizes due to union of active neurons quickly approaching dense computation. We introduce Polar Sparsity, highlighting a key shift in sparsity importance from MLP to Attention layers as we scale batch size and sequence length. While MLP layers become more compute-efficient under batching, their sparsity vanishes. In contrast, attention becomes increasingly more expensive at scale, while their head sparsity remains stable and batch-invariant. We develop hardware-efficient, sparsity-aware GPU kernels for selective MLP and Attention computations, delivering up to \(2.2\times\) end-to-end speedups for models like OPT, LLaMA-2 \& 3, across various batch sizes and sequence lengths without compromising accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate that contextual sparsity can scale effectively to large batch sizes, delivering substantial inference acceleration with minimal changes, making Polar Sparsity practical for large-scale, high-throughput LLM deployment systems.

      To reduce computational and memory costs in Large Language Models (LLMs), dynamic workload reduction schemes like Mixture of Experts (MoEs), parameter pruning, layer freezing, sparse attention, early token exit, and Mixture of Depths (MoDs) have emerged. However, these methods introduce severe workload imbalances, limiting their practicality for large-scale distributed training. We propose DynMo, an autonomous dynamic load balancing solution that ensures optimal compute distribution when using pipeline parallelism in training dynamic models. DynMo adaptively balances workloads, dynamically packs tasks into fewer workers to free idle resources, and supports both multi-GPU single-node and multi-node systems. Compared to static training methods (Megatron-LM, DeepSpeed), DynMo accelerates training by up to 1.23x (MoEs), 3.18x (pruning), 2.23x (layer freezing), 4.02x (sparse attention), 4.52x (early exit), and 1.17x (MoDs).

      Machine unlearning aims to selectively remove targeted knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs), ensuring they forget specified content while retaining essential information. Existing unlearning metrics assess whether a model correctly answers retain queries and rejects forget queries, but they fail to capture real-world scenarios where forget queries rarely appear in isolation. In fact, forget and retain queries often coexist within the same prompt, making mixed-query evaluation crucial. We introduce SEPS, an evaluation framework that explicitly measures a model's ability to both forget and retain information within a single prompt. Through extensive experiments across three benchmarks, we identify two key failure modes in existing unlearning methods: (1) untargeted unlearning indiscriminately erases both forget and retain content once a forget query appears, and (2) targeted unlearning overfits to single-query scenarios, leading to catastrophic failures when handling multiple queries. To address these issues, we propose Mixed Prompt (MP) unlearning, a strategy that integrates both forget and retain queries into a unified training objective. Our approach significantly improves unlearning effectiveness, demonstrating robustness even in complex settings with up to eight mixed forget and retain queries in a single prompt.

Scores are aggregated using Principal Component Analysis and mapped to a percentile rank against human-authored works. Our experiments demonstrate that WebNovelBench effectively differentiates between human-written masterpieces, popular web novels, and LLM-generated content. We provide a comprehensive analysis of 24 state-of-the-art LLMs, ranking their storytelling abilities and offering insights for future development.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing, demonstrating strong capabilities in tasks such as text generation, summarization, and reasoning. Recently, their potential for automating precise text editing tasks across specialized domains, such as programming code, LaTeX, and structured database languages, has gained attention. However, current state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle with executing precise, instruction-driven edits, particularly when structural accuracy and strict adherence to domain conventions are required. To address these challenges, we introduce InstrEditBench, an automated benchmark dataset comprising over 30,000 structured editing tasks spanning diverse domains, including Wikipedia articles, LaTeX documents, source code, and database languages. Using this benchmark, we develop FineEdit, a specialized editing model explicitly trained for accurate, context-aware text modifications. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that FineEdit outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving improvements of approximately 10% over Gemini models on single-turn edits, up to 30% over Llama-3.2-3B, and exceeding Mistral-7B-OpenOrca performance by over 40% on direct editing tasks. FineEdit also effectively generalizes to realistic multi-turn editing scenarios, highlighting its practical applicability.

      Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have propelled intelligent agents from reactive responses to proactive support. While promising, existing proactive agents either rely exclusively on observations from enclosed environments (e.g., desktop UIs) with direct LLM inference or employ rule-based proactive notifications, leading to suboptimal user intent understanding and limited functionality for proactive service. In this paper, we introduce ContextAgent, the first context-aware proactive agent that incorporates extensive sensory contexts to enhance the proactive capabilities of LLM agents. ContextAgent first extracts multi-dimensional contexts from massive sensory perceptions on wearables (e.g., video and audio) to understand user intentions. ContextAgent then leverages the sensory contexts and the persona contexts from historical data to predict the necessity for proactive services. When proactive assistance is needed, ContextAgent further automatically calls the necessary tools to assist users unobtrusively. To evaluate this new task, we curate ContextAgentBench, the first benchmark for evaluating context-aware proactive LLM agents, covering 1,000 samples across nine daily scenarios and twenty tools. Experiments on ContextAgentBench show that ContextAgent outperforms baselines by achieving up to 8.5% and 6.0% higher accuracy in proactive predictions and tool calling, respectively. We hope our research can inspire the development of more advanced, human-centric, proactive AI assistants.

      We demonstrate that geometrically distinctive keys during LLM inference tend to have high attention scores. Based on the phenomenon we propose KeyDiff, a training-free KV cache eviction method based solely on key similarity. Unlike other KV cache eviction methods, KeyDiff can process arbitrarily long prompts within strict resource constraints and efficiently generate responses. We provide a theoretical basis for KeyDiff by relating key diversity with attention scores. These results imply KeyDiff can efficiently identify the most important tokens to retain. Notably KeyDiff does not rely on attention scores, allowing the use of optimized attention mechanisms like FlashAttention. Under a strict memory allowance, we demonstrate the effectiveness of KeyDiff for the Llama and Qwen model families by observing a performance gap of less than 0.04% with 8K cache budget ($\sim$23% KV cache reduction) from the non-evicting baseline on LongBench for Llama 3.1-8B and Llama 3.2-3B. We also observe near baseline performance for Deepseek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B on the Math500 reasoning benchmark and decrease end-to-end inference latency by up to 30% compared to the other token-eviction methods.

      While LLMs excel at open-ended reasoning, they often struggle with cost-sensitive planning, either treating all actions as having equal cost or failing to stay within strict budgets. In this paper, we introduce Cost-Augmented Monte Carlo Tree Search (CATS), a novel approach that brings explicit cost-awareness into LLM-guided planning. Tight cost constraints push the planner to quickly identify infeasible solutions, while looser constraints encourage optimization for minimal cost. We benchmark top LLMs such as GPT-4.1, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and DeepSeek-R1, against our CATS planner to evaluate their performance in cost-sensitive scenarios. Our experiments suggest that raw LLMs such as GPT-4.1 often falter under tight budgets, whereas CATS consistently delivers strong performance, achieving higher task success rates and better cost efficiency. CATS provides an effective solution for budget-aware decision-making by combining the reasoning power of LLMs with structured search.

      While large language model (LLM)-based chatbots have demonstrated strong capabilities in generating coherent and contextually relevant responses, they often struggle with understanding when to speak, particularly in delivering brief, timely reactions during ongoing conversations. This limitation arises largely from their reliance on text input, lacking the rich contextual cues in real-world human dialogue. In this work, we focus on real-time prediction of response types, with an emphasis on short, reactive utterances that depend on subtle, multimodal signals across vision, audio, and text. To support this, we introduce a new multimodal dataset constructed from real-world conversational videos, containing temporally aligned visual, auditory, and textual streams. This dataset enables fine-grained modeling of response timing in dyadic interactions. Building on this dataset, we propose MM-When2Speak, a multimodal LLM-based model that adaptively integrates visual, auditory, and textual context to predict when a response should occur, and what type of response is appropriate. Experiments show that MM-When2Speak significantly outperforms state-of-the-art unimodal and LLM-based baselines, achieving up to a 4x improvement in response timing accuracy over leading commercial LLMs. These results underscore the importance of multimodal inputs for producing timely, natural, and engaging conversational AI.

While LLMs excel at reasoning and generalization, they struggle with time-series inputs due to limited semantic context, numerical complexity, and sequence variability. To address these challenges, we construct SensorQA, a question-answering dataset of human-intuitive sensor-text pairs spanning diverse HAR scenarios. It supervises the Sensor-Language Alignment stage, where the model aligns sensor inputs with trend descriptions. Special tokens are introduced to mark channel boundaries. This alignment enables LLMs to interpret numerical patterns, channel-specific signals, and variable-length inputs--without requiring human annotation. In the subsequent Task-Aware Tuning stage, we adapt the model for multivariate HAR classification, achieving performance that matches or exceeds state-of-the-art methods. Our results show that, guided by human-intuitive alignment, SensorLLM becomes an effective sensor learner, reasoner, and classifier--generalizing across varied HAR settings and paving the way for foundation model research in time-series analysis.

      Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a powerful tool for enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) by optimizing their policies with reward signals. Yet, RL's success relies on the reliability of rewards, which are provided by verifiers. In this paper, we expose and analyze a widespread problem--false negatives--where verifiers wrongly reject correct model outputs. Our in-depth study of the Big-Math-RL-Verified dataset reveals that over 38% of model-generated responses suffer from false negatives, where the verifier fails to recognize correct answers. We show, both empirically and theoretically, that these false negatives severely impair RL training by depriving the model of informative gradient signals and slowing convergence. To mitigate this, we propose tinyV, a lightweight LLM-based verifier that augments existing rule-based methods, which dynamically identifies potential false negatives and recovers valid responses to produce more accurate reward estimates. Across multiple math-reasoning benchmarks, integrating TinyV boosts pass rates by up to 10% and accelerates convergence relative to the baseline. Our findings highlight the critical importance of addressing verifier false negatives and offer a practical approach to improve RL-based fine-tuning of LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/uw-nsl/TinyV.

However, existing works usually overlook the exploration of LLMs' ability to detect characters' known knowledge errors (KKE) and unknown knowledge errors (UKE) while playing roles, which would lead to low-quality automatic construction of character trainable corpus. In this paper, we propose RoleKE-Bench to evaluate LLMs' ability to detect errors in KKE and UKE. The results indicate that even the latest LLMs struggle to detect these two types of errors effectively, especially when it comes to familiar knowledge. We experimented with various reasoning strategies and propose an agent-based reasoning method, Self-Recollection and Self-Doubt (S$^2$RD), to explore further the potential for improving error detection capabilities. Experiments show that our method effectively improves the LLMs' ability to detect error character knowledge, but it remains an issue that requires ongoing attention.

Unlike prior work that focuses on inference rule-based reasoning, which often involves deducing conclusions from a set of premises, our approach leverages the search-based nature of SAT problems, where the objective is to find a solution that fulfills a specified set of logical constraints. Each instance in SATBench is generated from a SAT formula, then translated into a story context and conditions using LLMs. The generation process is fully automated and allows for adjustable difficulty by varying the number of clauses. All 2100 puzzles are validated through both LLM-assisted and solver-based consistency checks, with human validation on a subset. Experimental results show that even the strongest model, o4-mini, achieves only 65.0% accuracy on hard UNSAT problems, close to the random baseline of 50%. SATBench exposes fundamental limitations in the search-based logical reasoning abilities of current LLMs and provides a scalable testbed for future research in logical reasoning.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are susceptible to adversarial attacks such as jailbreaking, which can elicit harmful or unsafe behaviors. This vulnerability is exacerbated in multilingual settings, where multilingual safety-aligned data is often limited. Thus, developing a guardrail capable of detecting and filtering unsafe content across diverse languages is critical for deploying LLMs in real-world applications. In this work, we introduce a multilingual guardrail with reasoning for prompt classification. Our method consists of: (1) synthetic multilingual data generation incorporating culturally and linguistically nuanced variants, (2) supervised fine-tuning, and (3) a curriculum-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework that further improves performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our multilingual guardrail, MrGuard, consistently outperforms recent baselines across both in-domain and out-of-domain languages by more than 15%. We also evaluate MrGuard's robustness to multilingual variations, such as code-switching and low-resource language distractors in the prompt, and demonstrate that it preserves safety judgments under these challenging conditions. The multilingual reasoning capability of our guardrail enables it to generate explanations, which are particularly useful for understanding language-specific risks and ambiguities in multilingual content moderation.

The evaluation shows that many LLMs have a more than 10\% performance drop compared to the original problems. To fully utilize sensitivity, CTF-Instruct, an incremental instruction fine-tuning framework, extends on existing data and uses a selection mechanism to meet the three dimensions of difficulty, diversity, and sensitivity. Experiments show that LLMs fine-tuned with CTF-Instruct data achieve over a 2\% improvement on CTF-Code, and more than a 10\% performance boost on LiveCodeBench, validating the feasibility of enhancing LLMs' sensitivity to improve performance.

      Large Language Model (LLM) inference, where a trained model generates text one word at a time in response to user prompts, is a computationally intensive process requiring efficient scheduling to optimize latency and resource utilization. A key challenge in LLM inference is the management of the Key-Value (KV) cache, which reduces redundant computations but introduces memory constraints. In this work, we model LLM inference with KV cache constraints theoretically and propose a novel batching and scheduling algorithm that minimizes inference latency while effectively managing the KV cache's memory. More specifically, we make the following contributions. First, to evaluate the performance of online algorithms for scheduling in LLM inference, we introduce a hindsight optimal benchmark, formulated as an integer program that computes the minimum total inference latency under full future information. Second, we prove that no deterministic online algorithm can achieve a constant competitive ratio when the arrival process is arbitrary. Third, motivated by the computational intractability of solving the integer program at scale, we propose a polynomial-time online scheduling algorithm and show that under certain conditions it can achieve a constant competitive ratio. We also demonstrate our algorithm's strong empirical performance by comparing it to the hindsight optimal in a synthetic dataset. Finally, we conduct empirical evaluations on a real-world public LLM inference dataset, simulating the Llama2-70B model on A100 GPUs, and show that our algorithm significantly outperforms the benchmark algorithms. Overall, our results offer a path toward more sustainable and cost-effective LLM deployment.

      The full-size MLPs and the projection layers in attention introduce tremendous model sizes of large language models (LLMs), imposing extremely demanding needs of computational resources in the pre-training stage. However, we empirically observe that the activations of pre-trained LLMs exhibit low-rank property. Motivated by such observations, we propose CoLA and its memory-efficient implementation, CoLA-M, to replace these full-size layers with compute-efficient auto-encoders that naturally enforce low-rank activations throughout training. This fundamental architectural change eliminates the activation redundancy and significantly boosts model capacity and training efficiency. Experiments on LLaMA models with 60 million to 7 billion parameters show that CoLA reduces the computing cost by $\bf 2\pmb{\times}$ and improves training throughput by $\bf 1.86\pmb{\times}$ while maintaining full-rank level performance. CoLA-M further squeezes memory cost without sacrificing throughput, offering a pre-training approach with collectively superior parameter, computing, and memory efficiency. The LLMs produced are also $\bf 2\pmb{\times}$ smaller, enabling faster inference with lower memory cost on resource-constrained platforms.

(2) Naive LLMs usually extract inaccurate knowledge from some domain-specific documents. (3) Hallucination phenomenon cannot be overlooked when directly using LLMs to construct KGs. In this paper, we propose \textbf{GraphJudge}, a KG construction framework to address the aforementioned challenges.

      Serving LLMs with a cluster of GPUs is common nowadays, where the serving system must meet strict latency SLOs required by applications. However, the stateful nature of LLM serving requires maintaining huge states (i.e., KVCache) in limited GPU memory. Under spikes in real-world workloads, GPU memory can be easily throttled, leading to orders of magnitude higher response latency due to queuing introduced by waiting for KVCache to be reclaimed. Prior KVCache-centric approaches handle load throttling by dropping, migrating, or swapping KVCache. These methods fail to release sufficient memory quickly with requests still queued. This paper proposes the first parameter-centric approach to handling throttling by selectively dropping replicated parameters to instantly free memory for requests, based on an unnoticed observation that model parameters are commonly replicated across GPUs for serving LLMs. With additional memory, all requests can be served with a larger batch without queuing. To make the parameter-centric approach correct and efficient, we cooperatively execute requests on GPUs with a complete copy of parameters using pipeline parallelism, and derive an appropriate drop plan without unnecessary cooperation. We also design techniques to minimize the performance overhead due to pipeline parallelism with the execution patterns of requests under drop. Evaluations show that {\sys} reduces the tail TTFT of requests under throttling by up to 72.2 times compared to the state-of-the-art systems including Llumnix, vLLM and InferCept.

      Large language models (LLMs) are now ubiquitous in user-facing applications, yet they still generate undesirable toxic outputs, including profanity, vulgarity, and derogatory remarks. Although numerous detoxification methods exist, most apply broad, surface-level fixes and can therefore easily be circumvented by jailbreak attacks. In this paper we leverage sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to identify toxicity-related directions in the residual stream of models and perform targeted activation steering using the corresponding decoder vectors. We introduce three tiers of steering aggressiveness and evaluate them on GPT-2 Small and Gemma-2-2B, revealing trade-offs between toxicity reduction and language fluency. At stronger steering strengths, these causal interventions surpass competitive baselines in reducing toxicity by up to 20%, though fluency can degrade noticeably on GPT-2 Small depending on the aggressiveness. Crucially, standard NLP benchmark scores upon steering remain stable, indicating that the model's knowledge and general abilities are preserved. We further show that feature-splitting in wider SAEs hampers safety interventions, underscoring the importance of disentangled feature learning. Our findings highlight both the promise and the current limitations of SAE-based causal interventions for LLM detoxification, further suggesting practical guidelines for safer language-model deployment.

      Bayesian optimization (BO) is a sequential decision-making tool widely used for optimizing expensive black-box functions. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable adaptability in low-data regimes, making them promising tools for black-box optimization by leveraging contextual knowledge to propose high-quality query points. However, relying solely on LLMs as optimization agents introduces risks due to their lack of explicit surrogate modeling and calibrated uncertainty, as well as their inherently opaque internal mechanisms. This structural opacity makes it difficult to characterize or control the exploration-exploitation trade-off, ultimately undermining theoretical tractability and reliability. To address this, we propose LLINBO: LLM-in-the-Loop BO, a hybrid framework for BO that combines LLMs with statistical surrogate experts (e.g., Gaussian Processes (GP)). The core philosophy is to leverage contextual reasoning strengths of LLMs for early exploration, while relying on principled statistical models to guide efficient exploitation. Specifically, we introduce three mechanisms that enable this collaboration and establish their theoretical guarantees. We end the paper with a real-life proof-of-concept in the context of 3D printing. The code to reproduce the results can be found at https://github.com/UMDataScienceLab/LLM-in-the-Loop-BO.

Unlike traditional evaluations on language generation results, we propose to evaluate the correctness of the detailed inference patterns of an LLM behind its seemingly correct outputs. To this end, we quantify the interactions between input phrases used by the LLM as primitive inference patterns, because recent theoretical achievements have proven several mathematical guarantees of the faithfulness of the interaction-based explanation. We design a set of metrics to evaluate the detailed inference patterns of LLMs. Experiments show that even when the language generation results appear correct, a significant portion of the inference patterns used by the LLM for the legal judgment may represent misleading or irrelevant logic.

      There has been growing interest in Multimodal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (MABSA) in recent years. Existing methods predominantly rely on pre-trained small language models (SLMs) to collect information related to aspects and sentiments from both image and text, with an aim to align these two modalities. However, small SLMs possess limited capacity and knowledge, often resulting in inaccurate identification of meaning, aspects, sentiments, and their interconnections in textual and visual data. On the other hand, Large language models (LLMs) have shown exceptional capabilities in various tasks by effectively exploring fine-grained information in multimodal data. However, some studies indicate that LLMs still fall short compared to fine-tuned small models in the field of ABSA. Based on these findings, we propose a novel framework, termed LRSA, which combines the decision-making capabilities of SLMs with additional information provided by LLMs for MABSA. Specifically, we inject explanations generated by LLMs as rationales into SLMs and employ a dual cross-attention mechanism for enhancing feature interaction and fusion, thereby augmenting the SLMs' ability to identify aspects and sentiments. We evaluated our method using two baseline models, numerous experiments highlight the superiority of our approach on three widely-used benchmarks, indicating its generalizability and applicability to most pre-trained models for MABSA.

Our approach is two-fold: (1) we retrieve analogous problems and use their proofs to guide the LLM, and (2) a formal verifier evaluates the generated proofs and provides feedback, helping the model fix incorrect proofs. We demonstrate that our method significantly improves proof accuracy for OpenAI's o1 model (58%-70% improvement); both analogous problems and the verifier's feedback contribute to these gains. More broadly, shifting to LLMs that generate provably correct conclusions could dramatically improve their reliability, accuracy and consistency, unlocking complex tasks and critical real-world applications that require trustworthiness.

      Serverless computing has grown rapidly for serving Large Language Model (LLM) inference due to its pay-as-you-go pricing, fine-grained GPU usage, and rapid scaling. However, our analysis reveals that current serverless can effectively serve general LLM but fail with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) inference due to three key limitations: 1) massive parameter redundancy among functions where 99% of weights are unnecessarily duplicated, 2) costly artifact loading latency beyond LLM loading, and 3) magnified resource contention when serving multiple LoRA LLMs. These inefficiencies lead to massive GPU wastage, increased Time-To-First-Token (TTFT), and high monetary costs. We propose ServerlessLoRA, a novel serverless inference system designed for faster and cheaper LoRA LLM serving. ServerlessLoRA enables secure backbone LLM sharing across isolated LoRA functions to reduce redundancy. We design a pre-loading method that pre-loads comprehensive LoRA artifacts to minimize cold-start latency. Furthermore, ServerlessLoRA employs contention aware batching and offloading to mitigate GPU resource conflicts during bursty workloads. Experiment on industrial workloads demonstrates that ServerlessLoRA reduces TTFT by up to 86% and cuts monetary costs by up to 89% compared to state-of-the-art LLM inference solutions.

      Routing large language models (LLMs) is a new paradigm that uses a router to recommend the best LLM from a pool of candidates for a given input. In this paper, our comprehensive analysis with more than 8,500 LLMs reveals a novel model-level scaling up phenomenon in Routing LLMs, i.e., a capable router can significantly enhance the performance of this paradigm as the number of candidates increases. This improvement can even surpass the performance of the best single model in the pool and many existing strong LLMs, confirming it a highly promising paradigm. However, the lack of comprehensive and open-source benchmarks for Routing LLMs has hindered the development of routers. In this paper, we introduce RouterEval, a benchmark tailored for router research, which includes over 200,000,000 performance records for 12 popular LLM evaluations across various areas such as commonsense reasoning, semantic understanding, etc., based on over 8,500 various LLMs. Using RouterEval, extensive evaluations of existing Routing LLM methods reveal that most still have significant room for improvement.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been leveraged for asset pricing tasks and stock trading applications, enabling AI agents to generate investment decisions from unstructured financial data. However, most evaluations of LLM timing-based investing strategies are conducted on narrow timeframes and limited stock universes, overstating effectiveness due to survivorship and data-snooping biases. We critically assess their generalizability and robustness by proposing FINSABER, a backtesting framework evaluating timing-based strategies across longer periods and a larger universe of symbols. Systematic backtests over two decades and 100+ symbols reveal that previously reported LLM advantages deteriorate significantly under broader cross-section and over a longer-term evaluation. Our market regime analysis further demonstrates that LLM strategies are overly conservative in bull markets, underperforming passive benchmarks, and overly aggressive in bear markets, incurring heavy losses. These findings highlight the need to develop LLM strategies that are able to prioritise trend detection and regime-aware risk controls over mere scaling of framework complexity.

      As organizations increasingly rely on AI systems for decision support in sustainability contexts, it becomes critical to understand the inherent biases and perspectives embedded in Large Language Models (LLMs). This study systematically investigates how five state-of-the-art LLMs -- Claude, DeepSeek, GPT, LLaMA, and Mistral - conceptualize sustainability and its relationship with AI. We administered validated, psychometric sustainability-related questionnaires - each 100 times per model -- to capture response patterns and variability. Our findings revealed significant inter-model differences: For example, GPT exhibited skepticism about the compatibility of AI and sustainability, whereas LLaMA demonstrated extreme techno-optimism with perfect scores for several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Models also diverged in attributing institutional responsibility for AI and sustainability integration, a results that holds implications for technology governance approaches. Our results demonstrate that model selection could substantially influence organizational sustainability strategies, highlighting the need for awareness of model-specific biases when deploying LLMs for sustainability-related decision-making.

      Large language models have been used to simulate human society using multi-agent systems. Most current social simulation research emphasizes interactive behaviors in fixed environments, ignoring information opacity, relationship variability, and diffusion diversity. In this paper, we first propose a general framework for exploring multi-agent information diffusion. We identified LLMs' deficiency in the perception and utilization of social relationships, as well as diverse actions. Then, we designed a dynamic attention mechanism to help agents allocate attention to different information, addressing the limitations of the LLM attention mechanism. Agents start by responding to external information stimuli within a five-agent group, increasing group size and forming information circles while developing relationships and sharing information. Additionally, we explore the information diffusion features in the asymmetric open environment by observing the evolution of information gaps, diffusion patterns, and the accumulation of social capital, which are closely linked to psychological, sociological, and communication theories.

We fine-tune LLMs using only synthetic instructions and evaluate their performance on a benchmark dataset containing both synthetic and human-written instructions. Our results reveal that while models generalize well on simple tasks, their performance degrades significantly on more complex tasks.

MindVote comprises 276 poll instances with 1,142 data entry points from three platforms (Weibo, Reddit, Fizz), features bilingual content (Chinese/English), and covers five domains. Our evaluation of 18 LLMs demonstrates that top-performing models achieve an overall score of 0.74, an 80% relative improvement over traditional baselines, and then we analyze LLM world model bias with human preferences across societal bias dimensions. MindVote also uncovers significant disparities related to platform, language, and domain. We present strategies to optimize LLM performance and use LLM-as-a-Judge to assess reasoning in societal contexts. Furthermore, we show that temperature controls can reflect a way of human thinking diversity and opinion shifts in polling.

      Large foundation models trained on large-scale vision-language data can boost Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVD) via synthetic training data, yet the hand-crafted pipelines often introduce bias and overfit to specific prompts. We sidestep this issue by directly fusing hidden states from Large Language Models (LLMs) into detectors-an avenue surprisingly under-explored. This paper presents a systematic method to enhance visual grounding by utilizing decoder layers of the LLM of an MLLM. We introduce a zero-initialized cross-attention adapter to enable efficient knowledge fusion from LLMs to object detectors, a new approach called LED (LLM Enhanced Open-Vocabulary Object Detection). We find that intermediate LLM layers already encode rich spatial semantics; adapting only the early layers yields most of the gain. With Swin-T as the vision encoder, Qwen2-0.5B + LED lifts GroundingDINO by 3.82 % on OmniLabel at just 8.7 % extra GFLOPs, and a larger vision backbone pushes the improvement to 6.22 %. Extensive ablations on adapter variants, LLM scales and fusion depths further corroborate our design.

Rather than view this as a drawback, in this paper we introduce a novel method for leveraging models' inconsistency to boost Pass@k performance. Specifically, we present a "Variator" agent that generates k variants of a given task and submits one candidate solution for each one. Our variant generation approach is applicable to a wide range of domains as it is task agnostic and compatible with free-form inputs. We demonstrate the efficacy of our agent theoretically using a probabilistic model of the inconsistency effect, and show empirically that it outperforms the baseline on the APPS dataset. Furthermore, we establish that inconsistency persists even in frontier reasoning models across coding and cybersecurity domains, suggesting our method is likely to remain relevant for future model generations.

      Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are crucial in modern software development. Large Language Models (LLMs) assist in automated code generation but often struggle with API hallucination, including invoking non-existent APIs and misusing existing ones in practical development scenarios. Existing studies resort to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods for mitigating the hallucination issue, but tend to fail since they generally ignore the structural dependencies in practical projects and do not indeed validate whether the generated APIs are available or not. To address these limitations, we propose MARIN, a framework for mitigating API hallucination in code generated by LLMs with hierarchical dependency aware. MARIN consists of two phases: Hierarchical Dependency Mining, which analyzes local and global dependencies of the current function, aiming to supplement comprehensive project context in LLMs input, and Dependency Constrained Decoding, which utilizes mined dependencies to adaptively constrain the generation process, aiming to ensure the generated APIs align with the projects specifications. To facilitate the evaluation of the degree of API hallucination, we introduce a new benchmark APIHulBench and two new metrics including Micro Hallucination Number (MiHN) and Macro Hallucination Rate (MaHR). Experiments on six state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that MARIN effectively reduces API hallucinations, achieving an average decrease of 67.52% in MiHN and 73.56% in MaHR compared to the RAG approach. Applied to Huaweis internal projects and two proprietary LLMs, MARIN achieves average decreases of 57.33% in MiHN and 59.41% in MaHR.

      Recent advances in reasoning language models have witnessed a paradigm shift from short to long CoT pattern. Given the substantial computational cost of rollouts in long CoT models, maximizing the utility of fixed training datasets becomes crucial. Our analysis reveals that negative responses contain valuable components such as self-reflection and error-correction steps, yet primary existing methods either completely discard negative samples (RFT) or apply equal penalization across all tokens (RL), failing to leverage these potential learning signals. In light of this, we propose Behavior Constrained Policy Gradient with Negative Sample Augmentation (BCPG-NSA), a fine-grained offline RL framework that encompasses three stages: 1) sample segmentation, 2) consensus-based step correctness assessment combining LLM and PRM judgers, and 3) policy optimization with NSA designed to effectively mine positive steps within negative samples. Experimental results show that BCPG-NSA outperforms baselines on several challenging math/coding reasoning benchmarks using the same training dataset, achieving improved sample efficiency and demonstrating robustness and scalability when extended to multiple iterations.

      Maintaining consistent model performance across domains is a fundamental challenge in machine learning. While recent work has explored using LLM-generated data for fine-tuning, its impact on cross-domain generalization remains poorly understood. This paper presents a systematic analysis revealing that fine-tuning with LLM-generated data not only improves target task performance but also reduces non-target task degradation compared to fine-tuning with ground truth data. Through analyzing the data sequence in tasks of various domains, we demonstrate that this enhancement of non-target task robustness stems from the reduction of high perplexity tokens found in LLM-generated sequences. Following our findings, we showed that masking high perplexity tokens in ground truth training data achieves similar non-target task performance preservation, comparable to using LLM-generated data. Extensive experiments across different model families and scales, including Gemma 2 IT 2B, Llama 3 8B Instruct, and 3 additional models, agree with our findings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide an empirical explanation based on token perplexity reduction to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in LLMs after fine-tuning, offering valuable insights for developing more robust fine-tuning strategies.

      Recent studies demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to different prompt-based attacks, generating harmful content or sensitive information. Both closed-source and open-source LLMs are underinvestigated for these attacks. This paper studies effective prompt injection attacks against the $\mathbf{14}$ most popular open-source LLMs on five attack benchmarks. Current metrics only consider successful attacks, whereas our proposed Attack Success Probability (ASP) also captures uncertainty in the model's response, reflecting ambiguity in attack feasibility. By comprehensively analyzing the effectiveness of prompt injection attacks, we propose a simple and effective hypnotism attack; results show that this attack causes aligned language models, including Stablelm2, Mistral, Openchat, and Vicuna, to generate objectionable behaviors, achieving around $90$% ASP. They also indicate that our ignore prefix attacks can break all $\mathbf{14}$ open-source LLMs, achieving over $60$% ASP on a multi-categorical dataset. We find that moderately well-known LLMs exhibit higher vulnerability to prompt injection attacks, highlighting the need to raise public awareness and prioritize efficient mitigation strategies.

In this paper, we introduce a novel weak-to-strong unlearning algorithm to defend against backdoor attacks based on feature alignment knowledge distillation, named W2SDefense. Specifically, we first train a small-scale language model through full-parameter fine-tuning to serve as the clean teacher model. Then, this teacher model guides the large-scale poisoned student model in unlearning the backdoor, leveraging PEFT. Theoretical analysis suggests that W2SDefense has the potential to enhance the student model's ability to unlearn backdoor features, preventing the activation of the backdoor. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three state-of-the-art large language models and several different backdoor attack algorithms. Our empirical results demonstrate the outstanding performance of W2SDefense in defending against backdoor attacks without compromising model performance.

      Existing video understanding benchmarks often conflate knowledge-based and purely image-based questions, rather than clearly isolating a model's temporal reasoning ability, which is the key aspect that distinguishes video understanding from other modalities. We identify two major limitations that obscure whether higher scores truly indicate stronger understanding of the dynamic content in videos: (1) strong language priors, where models can answer questions without watching the video; and (2) shuffling invariance, where models maintain similar performance on certain questions even when video frames are temporally shuffled. To alleviate these issues, we propose VBenchComp, an automated pipeline that categorizes questions into different domains: LLM-Answerable, Semantic, and Temporal. Specifically, LLM-Answerable questions can be answered without viewing the video; Semantic questions remain answerable even when the video frames are shuffled; and Temporal questions require understanding the correct temporal order of frames. The rest of the questions are labeled as Others. This can enable fine-grained evaluation of different capabilities of a video LLM. Our analysis reveals nuanced model weaknesses that are hidden by traditional overall scores, and we offer insights and recommendations for designing future benchmarks that more accurately assess video LLMs.

      Although large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements, their security remains a pressing concern. One major threat is jailbreak attacks, where adversarial prompts bypass model safeguards to generate harmful or objectionable content. Researchers study jailbreak attacks to understand security and robustness of LLMs. However, existing jailbreak attack methods face two main challenges: (1) an excessive number of iterative queries, and (2) poor generalization across models. In addition, recent jailbreak evaluation datasets focus primarily on question-answering scenarios, lacking attention to text generation tasks that require accurate regeneration of toxic content. To tackle these challenges, we propose two contributions: (1) ICE, a novel black-box jailbreak method that employs Intent Concealment and divErsion to effectively circumvent security constraints. ICE achieves high attack success rates (ASR) with a single query, significantly improving efficiency and transferability across different models. (2) BiSceneEval, a comprehensive dataset designed for assessing LLM robustness in question-answering and text-generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that ICE outperforms existing jailbreak techniques, revealing critical vulnerabilities in current defense mechanisms. Our findings underscore the necessity of a hybrid security strategy that integrates predefined security mechanisms with real-time semantic decomposition to enhance the security of LLMs.

      Node classification is a fundamental task in graph analysis, with broad applications across various fields. Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled LLM-based approaches for this task. Although many studies demonstrate the impressive performance of LLM-based methods, the lack of clear design guidelines may hinder their practical application. In this work, we aim to establish such guidelines through a fair and systematic comparison of these algorithms. As a first step, we developed LLMNodeBed, a comprehensive codebase and testbed for node classification using LLMs. It includes 10 homophilic datasets, 4 heterophilic datasets, 8 LLM-based algorithms, 8 classic baselines, and 3 learning paradigms. Subsequently, we conducted extensive experiments, training and evaluating over 2,700 models, to determine the key settings (e.g., learning paradigms and homophily) and components (e.g., model size and prompt) that affect performance. Our findings uncover 8 insights, e.g., (1) LLM-based methods can significantly outperform traditional methods in a semi-supervised setting, while the advantage is marginal in a supervised setting; (2) Graph Foundation Models can beat open-source LLMs but still fall short of strong LLMs like GPT-4o in a zero-shot setting. We hope that the release of LLMNodeBed, along with our insights, will facilitate reproducible research and inspire future studies in this field.

      High-risk industries like nuclear and aviation use real-time monitoring to detect dangerous system conditions. Similarly, Large Language Models (LLMs) need monitoring safeguards. We propose a real-time framework to predict harmful AI outputs before they occur by using an unsupervised approach that treats normal behavior as the baseline and harmful outputs as outliers. Our study focuses specifically on backdoor-triggered responses -- where specific input phrases activate hidden vulnerabilities causing the model to generate unsafe content like violence, pornography, or hate speech. We address two key challenges: (1) identifying true causal indicators rather than surface correlations, and (2) preventing advanced models from deception -- deliberately evading monitoring systems. Hence, we approach this problem from an unsupervised lens by drawing parallels to human deception: just as humans exhibit physical indicators while lying, we investigate whether LLMs display distinct internal behavioral signatures when generating harmful content. Our study addresses two critical challenges: 1) designing monitoring systems that capture true causal indicators rather than superficial correlations; and 2)preventing intentional evasion by increasingly capable "Future models''. Our findings show that models can produce harmful content through causal mechanisms and can become deceptive by: (a) alternating between linear and non-linear representations, and (b) modifying feature relationships. To counter this, we developed Safety-Net -- a multi-detector framework that monitors different representation dimensions, successfully detecting harmful behavior even when information is shifted across representational spaces to evade individual monitors. Our evaluation shows 96% accuracy in detecting harmful cases using our unsupervised ensemble approach.

      Task-oriented dialogue systems based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained increasing attention across various industries and achieved significant results. Current approaches condense complex procedural workflows into a single agent to achieve satisfactory performance on large-scale LLMs. However, these approaches face challenges to achieve comparable performance on fine-tuned lightweight LLMs, due to their limited capabilities in handling multiple complex logic. In this work, we design a Domain-Independent Multi-Agent Framework (DIMF), which contains Intent Classification Agent, Slot Filling Agent and Response Agent. This approach simplifies the learning complexity and enhances the generalization ability by separating the tasks into domain-independent components. In this framework, we enhance the capabilities in contextual understanding using the Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO) method, and propose a simple and effective Data Distribution Adaptation (DDA) method to mitigate degradation issues during DPO training. Experiments conducted on the MultiWOZ datasets show that our proposed method achieves a better average performance among all the baselines. Extensive analysis also demonstrates that our proposed framework exhibits excellent generalizability and zero-shot capability.

      The combination of pre-trained speech encoders with large language models has enabled the development of speech LLMs that can handle a wide range of spoken language processing tasks. While these models are powerful and flexible, this very flexibility may make them more vulnerable to adversarial attacks. To examine the extent of this problem, in this work we investigate universal acoustic adversarial attacks on speech LLMs. Here a fixed, universal, adversarial audio segment is prepended to the original input audio. We initially investigate attacks that cause the model to either produce no output or to perform a modified task overriding the original prompt. We then extend the nature of the attack to be selective so that it activates only when specific input attributes, such as a speaker gender or spoken language, are present. Inputs without the targeted attribute should be unaffected, allowing fine-grained control over the model outputs. Our findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in Qwen2-Audio and Granite-Speech and suggest that similar speech LLMs may be susceptible to universal adversarial attacks. This highlights the need for more robust training strategies and improved resistance to adversarial attacks.

      LLM-as-a-Judge refers to the automatic modeling of preferences for responses generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), which is of significant importance for both LLM evaluation and reward modeling. Although generative LLMs have made substantial progress in various tasks, their performance as LLM-Judge still falls short of expectations. In this work, we propose Think-J, which improves generative LLM-as-a-Judge by learning how to think. We first utilized a small amount of curated data to develop the model with initial judgment thinking capabilities. Subsequently, we optimize the judgment thinking traces based on reinforcement learning (RL). We propose two methods for judgment thinking optimization, based on offline and online RL, respectively. The offline RL requires training a critic model to construct positive and negative examples for learning. The online method defines rule-based reward as feedback for optimization. Experimental results showed that our approach can significantly enhance the evaluation capability of generative LLM-Judge, surpassing both generative and classifier-based LLM-Judge without requiring extra human annotations.

      Multiagent collaboration has emerged as a promising framework for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite improvements in reasoning, the approach introduces substantial computational overhead resulting from iterative agent interactions. Furthermore, engaging in unnecessary debates increases the risk of generating erroneous responses. To address these challenges, we propose Debate Only When Necessary (DOWN), an adaptive multiagent debate framework that selectively activates debate based on the confidence score of the agent's initial response. Debate is activated only for queries requiring further deliberation, during which agents refine their outputs by referencing peer responses and associated confidence scores. Evaluations on benchmarks show that DOWN improves efficiency by up to six times while preserving or even outperforming the performance of existing methods. Further analysis indicates that DOWN effectively mitigates the risk of error propagation stemming from the unnecessary debate process. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in delivering high-performance LLM solutions at a lower computational cost.

      Open-weight large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced performance in the Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) task. However, their effectiveness diminishes when dealing with large database schemas, as the context length increases. To address this limitation, we present SQLong, a novel and efficient data augmentation framework designed to enhance LLM performance in long-context scenarios for the NL2SQL task. SQLong generates augmented datasets by extending existing database schemas with additional synthetic CREATE TABLE commands and corresponding data rows, sampled from diverse schemas in the training data. This approach effectively simulates long-context scenarios during finetuning and evaluation. Through experiments on the Spider and BIRD datasets, we demonstrate that LLMs finetuned with SQLong-augmented data significantly outperform those trained on standard datasets. These imply SQLong's practical implementation and its impact on improving NL2SQL capabilities in real-world settings with complex database schemas.

      Despite growing interest in automated hate speech detection, most existing approaches overlook the linguistic diversity of online content. Multilingual instruction-tuned large language models such as LLaMA, Aya, Qwen, and BloomZ offer promising capabilities across languages, but their effectiveness in identifying hate speech through zero-shot and few-shot prompting remains underexplored. This work evaluates LLM prompting-based detection across eight non-English languages, utilizing several prompting techniques and comparing them to fine-tuned encoder models. We show that while zero-shot and few-shot prompting lag behind fine-tuned encoder models on most of the real-world evaluation sets, they achieve better generalization on functional tests for hate speech detection. Our study also reveals that prompt design plays a critical role, with each language often requiring customized prompting techniques to maximize performance.

      Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), especially in scenarios where supervised fine-tuning (SFT) falls short due to limited chain-of-thought (CoT) data. Among RL-based post-training methods, group relative advantage estimation, as exemplified by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), has attracted considerable attention for eliminating the dependency on the value model, thereby simplifying training compared to traditional approaches like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). However, we observe that exsiting group relative advantage estimation method still suffers from training inefficiencies, particularly when the estimated advantage approaches zero. To address this limitation, we propose Advantage-Augmented Policy Optimization (AAPO), a novel RL algorithm that optimizes the cross-entropy (CE) loss using advantages enhanced through a momentum-based estimation scheme. This approach effectively mitigates the inefficiencies associated with group relative advantage estimation. Experimental results on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of AAPO.

      Large language models (LLMs) struggle with compositional generalisation, limiting their ability to systematically combine learned components to interpret novel inputs. While architectural modifications, fine-tuning, and data augmentation improve compositionality, they often have limited adaptability, face scalability constraints, or yield diminishing returns on real data. To address this, we propose CARMA, an intervention that enhances the stability and robustness of compositional reasoning in LLMs while preserving fine-tuned performance. CARMA employs mutual information regularisation and layer-wise stability constraints to mitigate feature fragmentation, ensuring structured representations persist across and within layers. We evaluate CARMA on inverse dictionary modelling and sentiment classification, measuring its impact on semantic consistency, performance stability, and robustness to lexical perturbations. Results show that CARMA reduces the variability introduced by fine-tuning, stabilises token representations, and improves compositional reasoning. While its effectiveness varies across architectures, CARMA's key strength lies in reinforcing learned structures rather than introducing new capabilities, making it a scalable auxiliary method. These findings suggest that integrating CARMA with fine-tuning can improve compositional generalisation while maintaining task-specific performance in LLMs.

      The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the emergence of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) to perform complex tasks through collaboration. However, the intricate nature of MAS, including their architecture and agent interactions, raises significant concerns regarding intellectual property (IP) protection. In this paper, we introduce MASLEAK, a novel attack framework designed to extract sensitive information from MAS applications. MASLEAK targets a practical, black-box setting, where the adversary has no prior knowledge of the MAS architecture or agent configurations. The adversary can only interact with the MAS through its public API, submitting attack query $q$ and observing outputs from the final agent. Inspired by how computer worms propagate and infect vulnerable network hosts, MASLEAK carefully crafts adversarial query $q$ to elicit, propagate, and retain responses from each MAS agent that reveal a full set of proprietary components, including the number of agents, system topology, system prompts, task instructions, and tool usages. We construct the first synthetic dataset of MAS applications with 810 applications and also evaluate MASLEAK against real-world MAS applications, including Coze and CrewAI. MASLEAK achieves high accuracy in extracting MAS IP, with an average attack success rate of 87% for system prompts and task instructions, and 92% for system architecture in most cases. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings and the potential defenses.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly powerful, with multilingual and multimodal capabilities improving by the day. These models are being evaluated through audits, alignment studies and red-teaming efforts to expose model vulnerabilities towards generating harmful, biased and unfair content. Existing red-teaming efforts have previously focused on the English language, using fixed template-based attacks; thus, models continue to be susceptible to multilingual jailbreaking strategies, especially in the multimodal context. In this study, we introduce a novel strategy that leverages code-mixing and phonetic perturbations to jailbreak LLMs for both text and image generation tasks. We also introduce two new jailbreak strategies that show higher effectiveness than baseline strategies. Our work presents a method to effectively bypass safety filters in LLMs while maintaining interpretability by applying phonetic misspellings to sensitive words in code-mixed prompts. Our novel prompts achieve a 99% Attack Success Rate for text generation and 78% for image generation, with Attack Relevance Rate of 100% for text generation and 95% for image generation when using the phonetically perturbed code-mixed prompts. Our interpretability experiments reveal that phonetic perturbations impact word tokenization, leading to jailbreak success. Our study motivates increasing the focus towards more generalizable safety alignment for multilingual multimodal models, especially in real-world settings wherein prompts can have misspelt words.

      Large language models of code exhibit high capability in performing diverse software engineering tasks, such as code translation, defect detection, text-to-code generation, and code summarization. While their ability to enhance developer productivity has spurred widespread use, these models have also seen substantial growth in size, often reaching billions of parameters. This scale demands efficient memory resource usage, prompting practitioners to use optimization techniques such as model quantization. Quantization uses smaller bit representations for the model parameters, reducing the precision of the weights. In this work, we investigate the impact of quantization on the risk of data poisoning attacks on these models, specifically examining whether it mitigates or exacerbates such vulnerabilities. We focus on two large language models, Meta's Llama-2-7b and CodeLlama-7b, applied to an SQL code generation task. Additionally, we introduce a new metric for measuring trojan signals in compromised models. We find that quantization has differing effects on code-generating LLMs: while reducing precision does not significantly alter Llama-2's behavior, it boosts performance and reduces attack success rates in CodeLlama, particularly at 4-bit precision.

      The challenge of slang translation lies in capturing context-dependent semantic extensions, as slang terms often convey meanings beyond their literal interpretation. While slang detection, explanation, and translation have been studied as isolated tasks in the era of large language models (LLMs), their intrinsic interdependence remains underexplored. The main reason is lacking of a benchmark where the two tasks can be a prerequisite for the third one, which can facilitate idiomatic translation. In this paper, we introduce the interpretative slang translation task (named SlangDIT) consisting of three sub-tasks: slang detection, cross-lingual slang explanation, and slang translation within the current context, aiming to generate more accurate translation with the help of slang detection and slang explanation. To this end, we construct a SlangDIT dataset, containing over 25k English-Chinese sentence pairs. Each source sentence mentions at least one slang term and is labeled with corresponding cross-lingual slang explanation. Based on the benchmark, we propose a deep thinking model, named SlangOWL. It firstly identifies whether the sentence contains a slang, and then judges whether the slang is polysemous and analyze its possible meaning. Further, the SlangOWL provides the best explanation of the slang term targeting on the current context. Finally, according to the whole thought, the SlangOWL offers a suitable translation. Our experiments on LLMs (\emph{e.g.}, Qwen2.5 and LLama-3.1), show that our deep thinking approach indeed enhances the performance of LLMs where the proposed SLangOWL significantly surpasses the vanilla models and supervised fine-tuned models without thinking.

      Tokenization is the first - and often underappreciated - layer of computation in language models. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enables transformer models to approximate recurrent computation by externalizing intermediate steps, we show that the success of such reasoning is fundamentally bounded by the structure of tokenized inputs. This work presents a theoretical and empirical investigation into how tokenization schemes, particularly subword-based methods like byte-pair encoding (BPE), impede symbolic computation by merging or obscuring atomic reasoning units. We introduce the notion of Token Awareness to formalize how poor token granularity disrupts logical alignment and prevents models from generalizing symbolic procedures. Through systematic evaluation on arithmetic and symbolic tasks, we demonstrate that token structure dramatically affect reasoning performance, causing failure even with CoT, while atomically-aligned formats unlock strong generalization, allowing small models (e.g., GPT-4o-mini) to outperform larger systems (e.g., o1) in structured reasoning. Our findings reveal that symbolic reasoning ability in LLMs is not purely architectural, but deeply conditioned on token-level representations.

      Session search involves a series of interactive queries and actions to fulfill user's complex information need. Current strategies typically prioritize sequential modeling for deep semantic understanding, overlooking the graph structure in interactions. While some approaches focus on capturing structural information, they use a generalized representation for documents, neglecting the word-level semantic modeling. In this paper, we propose Symbolic Graph Ranker (SGR), which aims to take advantage of both text-based and graph-based approaches by leveraging the power of recent Large Language Models (LLMs). Concretely, we first introduce a set of symbolic grammar rules to convert session graph into text. This allows integrating session history, interaction process, and task instruction seamlessly as inputs for the LLM. Moreover, given the natural discrepancy between LLMs pre-trained on textual corpora, and the symbolic language we produce using our graph-to-text grammar, our objective is to enhance LLMs' ability to capture graph structures within a textual format. To achieve this, we introduce a set of self-supervised symbolic learning tasks including link prediction, node content generation, and generative contrastive learning, to enable LLMs to capture the topological information from coarse-grained to fine-grained. Experiment results and comprehensive analysis on two benchmark datasets, AOL and Tiangong-ST, confirm the superiority of our approach. Our paradigm also offers a novel and effective methodology that bridges the gap between traditional search strategies and modern LLMs.

      Mathematical modeling is a cornerstone of scientific discovery and engineering practice, enabling the translation of real-world problems into formal systems across domains such as physics, biology, and economics. Unlike mathematical reasoning, which assumes a predefined formulation, modeling requires open-ended problem analysis, abstraction, and principled formalization. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities, they fall short in rigorous model construction, limiting their utility in real-world problem-solving. To this end, we formalize the task of LLM-powered real-world mathematical modeling, where agents must analyze problems, construct domain-appropriate formulations, and generate complete end-to-end solutions. We introduce MM-Bench, a curated benchmark of 111 problems from the Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM/ICM), spanning the years 2000 to 2025 and across ten diverse domains such as physics, biology, and economics. To tackle this task, we propose MM-Agent, an expert-inspired framework that decomposes mathematical modeling into four stages: open-ended problem analysis, structured model formulation, computational problem solving, and report generation. Experiments on MM-Bench show that MM-Agent significantly outperforms baseline agents, achieving an 11.88\% improvement over human expert solutions while requiring only 15 minutes and \$0.88 per task using GPT-4o.

      Despite rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs), the token-level autoregressive nature constrains their complex reasoning capabilities. To enhance LLM reasoning, inference-time techniques, including Chain/Tree/Graph-of-Thought(s), successfully improve the performance, as they are fairly cost-effective by guiding reasoning through sophisticated logical structures without modifying LLMs' parameters. However, these manually predefined, task-agnostic frameworks are applied uniformly across diverse tasks, lacking adaptability. To improve this, we propose RL-of-Thoughts (RLoT), where we train a lightweight navigator model with reinforcement learning (RL) to adaptively enhance LLM reasoning at inference time. Specifically, we design five basic logic blocks from the perspective of human cognition. During the reasoning process, the trained RL navigator dynamically selects the suitable logic blocks and combines them into task-specific logical structures according to problem characteristics. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks (AIME, MATH, GPQA, etc.) with multiple LLMs (GPT, Llama, Qwen, and DeepSeek) illustrate that RLoT outperforms established inference-time techniques by up to 13.4%. Remarkably, with less than 3K parameters, our RL navigator is able to make sub-10B LLMs comparable to 100B-scale counterparts. Moreover, the RL navigator demonstrates strong transferability: a model trained on one specific LLM-task pair can effectively generalize to unseen LLMs and tasks.

      Logit-based LLM watermarking traces and verifies AI-generated content by maintaining green and red token lists and increasing the likelihood of green tokens during generation. However, it fails in low-entropy scenarios, where predictable outputs make green token selection difficult without disrupting natural text flow. Existing approaches address this by assuming access to the original LLM to calculate entropy and selectively watermark high-entropy tokens. However, these methods face two major challenges: (1) high computational costs and detection delays due to reliance on the original LLM, and (2) potential risks of model leakage. To address these limitations, we propose Invisible Entropy (IE), a watermarking paradigm designed to enhance both safety and efficiency. Instead of relying on the original LLM, IE introduces a lightweight feature extractor and an entropy tagger to predict whether the entropy of the next token is high or low. Furthermore, based on theoretical analysis, we develop a threshold navigator that adaptively sets entropy thresholds. It identifies a threshold where the watermark ratio decreases as the green token count increases, enhancing the naturalness of the watermarked text and improving detection robustness. Experiments on HumanEval and MBPP datasets demonstrate that IE reduces parameter size by 99\% while achieving performance on par with state-of-the-art methods.

Several benchmarks have been developed that provide a test bed for factuality evaluation within the context of English-centric datasets, while relying on supplementary informative context like web links or text passages but ignoring the available structured factual resources. To this end, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have been identified as a useful aid for hallucination mitigation, as they provide a structured way to represent the facts about entities and their relations with minimal linguistic overhead. We bridge the lack of KG paths and multilinguality for factual language modeling within the existing hallucination evaluation benchmarks and propose a KG-based multilingual, multihop benchmark called \textbf{MultiHal} framed for generative text evaluation. As part of our data collection pipeline, we mined 140k KG-paths from open-domain KGs, from which we pruned noisy KG-paths, curating a high-quality subset of 25.9k. Our baseline evaluation shows an absolute scale increase by approximately 0.12 to 0.36 points for the semantic similarity score in KG-RAG over vanilla QA across multiple languages and multiple models, demonstrating the potential of KG integration.

      As increasingly capable large language models (LLMs) emerge, researchers have begun exploring their potential for subjective tasks. While recent work demonstrates that LLMs can be aligned with diverse human perspectives, evaluating this alignment on actual downstream tasks (e.g., hate speech detection) remains challenging due to the use of inconsistent datasets across studies. To address this issue, in this resource paper we propose a two-step framework: we (1) introduce SubData, an open-source Python library designed for standardizing heterogeneous datasets to evaluate LLM perspective alignment; and (2) present a theory-driven approach leveraging this library to test how differently-aligned LLMs (e.g., aligned with different political viewpoints) classify content targeting specific demographics. SubData's flexible mapping and taxonomy enable customization for diverse research needs, distinguishing it from existing resources. We invite contributions to add datasets to our initially proposed resource and thereby help expand SubData into a multi-construct benchmark suite for evaluating LLM perspective alignment on NLP tasks.

      Even though high-level synthesis (HLS) tools mitigate the challenges of programming domain-specific accelerators (DSAs) by raising the abstraction level, optimizing hardware directive parameters remains a significant hurdle. Existing heuristic and learning-based methods struggle with adaptability and sample efficiency. We present LLM-DSE, a multi-agent framework designed specifically for optimizing HLS directives. Combining LLM with design space exploration (DSE), our explorer coordinates four agents: Router, Specialists, Arbitrator, and Critic. These multi-agent components interact with various tools to accelerate the optimization process. LLM-DSE leverages essential domain knowledge to identify efficient parameter combinations while maintaining adaptability through verbal learning from online interactions. Evaluations on the HLSyn dataset demonstrate that LLM-DSE achieves substantial $2.55\times$ performance gains over state-of-the-art methods, uncovering novel designs while reducing runtime. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness and necessity of the proposed agent interactions. Our code is open-sourced here: https://github.com/Nozidoali/LLM-DSE.

      The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is intrinsically linked to the quality of its training data. Although several studies have proposed methods for high-quality data selection, they do not consider the importance of knowledge richness in text corpora. In this paper, we propose a novel and gradient-free High-Knowledge Scorer (HKS) to select high-quality data from the dimension of knowledge, to alleviate the problem of knowledge scarcity in the pre-trained corpus. We propose a comprehensive multi-domain knowledge element pool and introduce knowledge density and coverage as metrics to assess the knowledge content of the text. Based on this, we propose a comprehensive knowledge scorer to select data with intensive knowledge, which can also be utilized for domain-specific high-knowledge data selection by restricting knowledge elements to the specific domain. We train models on a high-knowledge bilingual dataset, and experimental results demonstrate that our scorer improves the model's performance in knowledge-intensive and general comprehension tasks, and is effective in enhancing both the generic and domain-specific capabilities of the model.

      Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is a fundamental task in modern recommender systems. In recent years, the integration of large language models (LLMs) has been shown to effectively enhance the performance of traditional CTR methods. However, existing LLM-enhanced methods often require extensive processing of detailed textual descriptions for large-scale instances or user/item entities, leading to substantial computational overhead. To address this challenge, this work introduces LLaCTR, a novel and lightweight LLM-enhanced CTR method that employs a field-level enhancement paradigm. Specifically, LLaCTR first utilizes LLMs to distill crucial and lightweight semantic knowledge from small-scale feature fields through self-supervised field-feature fine-tuning. Subsequently, it leverages this field-level semantic knowledge to enhance both feature representation and feature interactions. In our experiments, we integrate LLaCTR with six representative CTR models across four datasets, demonstrating its superior performance in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency compared to existing LLM-enhanced methods.

      Training LLMs relies on distributed implementations using multiple GPUs to compute gradients in parallel with sharded optimizers. However, synchronizing gradients in data parallel setups introduces communication overhead that grows with the number of workers, limiting parallelization efficiency. Local optimization algorithms reduce communications but incur high memory costs as they prevent optimizer state sharding, hindering scalability. To address this, we propose \textbf{AC}cumulate while \textbf{CO}mmunicate (\acco), a memory-efficient optimization algorithm for distributed LLM training.

      As large language models (LLMs) converge towards similar capabilities, the key to advancing their performance lies in identifying and incorporating valuable new information sources. However, evaluating which text collections are worth the substantial investment required for digitization, preprocessing, and integration into LLM systems remains a significant challenge. We present a novel approach to this challenge: an automated pipeline that evaluates the potential information gain from text collections without requiring model training or fine-tuning. Our method generates multiple choice questions (MCQs) from texts and measures an LLM's performance both with and without access to the source material. The performance gap between these conditions serves as a proxy for the collection's information potential. We validate our approach using five strategically selected datasets: EPFL PhD manuscripts, a private collection of Venetian historical records, two sets of Wikipedia articles on related topics, and a synthetic baseline dataset. Our results demonstrate that this method effectively identifies collections containing valuable novel information, providing a practical tool for prioritizing data acquisition and integration efforts.

      As large language models (LLMs) become widely deployed, concerns about their safety and alignment grow. An approach to steer LLM behavior, such as mitigating biases or defending against jailbreaks, is to identify which parts of a prompt influence specific aspects of the model's output. Token-level attribution methods offer a promising solution, but still struggle in text generation, explaining the presence of each token in the output separately, rather than the underlying semantics of the entire LLM response. We introduce ConceptX, a model-agnostic, concept-level explainability method that identifies the concepts, i.e., semantically rich tokens in the prompt, and assigns them importance based on the outputs' semantic similarity. Unlike current token-level methods, ConceptX also offers to preserve context integrity through in-place token replacements and supports flexible explanation goals, e.g., gender bias. ConceptX enables both auditing, by uncovering sources of bias, and steering, by modifying prompts to shift the sentiment or reduce the harmfulness of LLM responses, without requiring retraining. Across three LLMs, ConceptX outperforms token-level methods like TokenSHAP in both faithfulness and human alignment. Steering tasks boost sentiment shift by 0.252 versus 0.131 for random edits and lower attack success rates from 0.463 to 0.242, outperforming attribution and paraphrasing baselines. While prompt engineering and self-explaining methods sometimes yield safer responses, ConceptX offers a transparent and faithful alternative for improving LLM safety and alignment, demonstrating the practical value of attribution-based explainability in guiding LLM behavior.

      Length generalization, the ability to solve problems longer than those seen during training, remains a critical challenge for large language models (LLMs). Previous work modifies positional encodings (PEs) and data formats to improve length generalization on specific symbolic tasks such as addition and sorting. However, these approaches are fundamentally limited to special tasks, often degrading general language performance. Furthermore, they are typically evaluated on small transformers trained from scratch on single tasks and can cause performance drop when applied during post-training stage of practical LLMs with general capabilities. Hu et al., (2024) proposed Rule-Following Fine-Tuning (RFFT) to improve length generalization in the post-training stage of LLMs. Despite its compatibility with practical models and strong performance, RFFT is proposed for single tasks too, requiring re-training for each individual task with extensive examples. In this paper, we study length generalization in multi-task settings and propose Meta Rule-Following Fine-Tuning (Meta-RFFT), the first framework enabling robust cross-task length generalization. As our first contribution, we construct a large length generalization dataset containing 86 tasks spanning code execution, number processing, symbolic and logical reasoning tasks, beyond the common addition or multiplication tasks. Secondly, we show that cross-task length generalization is possible with Meta-RFFT. After training on a large number of tasks and instances, the models achieve remarkable length generalization ability on unseen tasks with minimal fine-tuning or one-shot prompting. For example, after fine-tuning on 1 to 5 digit addition, our 32B model achieves 95% accuracy on 30 digit addition, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art reasoning models (DeepSeek-R1-671B: 72%), despite never seeing this task during RF-pretraining.

      Large language models (LLMs) have been widely deployed with rapidly expanding context windows to support increasingly demanding applications. However, long contexts pose significant deployment challenges, primarily due to the KV cache whose size grows proportionally with context length. While KV cache compression methods are proposed to address this issue, KV dropping methods incur considerable accuracy loss, and KV retrieval methods suffer from significant efficiency bottlenecks. We propose FreeKV, an algorithm-system co-optimization framework to enhance KV retrieval efficiency while preserving accuracy. On the algorithm side, FreeKV introduces speculative retrieval to shift the KV selection and recall processes out of the critical path, combined with fine-grained correction to ensure accuracy. On the system side, FreeKV employs hybrid KV layouts across CPU and GPU memory to eliminate fragmented data transfers, and leverages double-buffered streamed recall to further improve efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that FreeKV achieves near-lossless accuracy across various scenarios and models, delivering up to 13$\times$ speedup compared to SOTA KV retrieval methods.

      Current Large Language Models (LLMs) can assist developing program code beside many other things, but can they support working with Knowledge Graphs (KGs) as well? Which LLM is offering the best capabilities in the field of Semantic Web and Knowledge Graph Engineering (KGE)? Is this possible to determine without checking many answers manually? The LLM-KG-Bench framework in Version 3.0 is designed to answer these questions. It consists of an extensible set of tasks for automated evaluation of LLM answers and covers different aspects of working with semantic technologies. In this paper the LLM-KG-Bench framework is presented in Version 3 along with a dataset of prompts, answers and evaluations generated with it and several state-of-the-art LLMs. Significant enhancements have been made to the framework since its initial release, including an updated task API that offers greater flexibility in handling evaluation tasks, revised tasks, and extended support for various open models through the vllm library, among other improvements. A comprehensive dataset has been generated using more than 30 contemporary open and proprietary LLMs, enabling the creation of exemplary model cards that demonstrate the models' capabilities in working with RDF and SPARQL, as well as comparing their performance on Turtle and JSON-LD RDF serialization tasks.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into critical systems in industries like healthcare and finance. Users can often submit queries to LLM-enabled chatbots, some of which can enrich responses with information retrieved from internal databases storing sensitive data. This gives rise to a range of attacks in which a user submits a malicious query and the LLM-system outputs a response that creates harm to the owner, such as leaking internal data or creating legal liability by harming a third-party. While security tools are being developed to counter these threats, there is little formal evaluation of their effectiveness and usability. This study addresses this gap by conducting a thorough comparative analysis of LLM security tools. We identified 13 solutions (9 closed-source, 4 open-source), but only 7 were evaluated due to a lack of participation by proprietary model owners.To evaluate, we built a benchmark dataset of malicious prompts, and evaluate these tools performance against a baseline LLM model (ChatGPT-3.5-Turbo). Our results show that the baseline model has too many false positives to be used for this task. Lakera Guard and ProtectAI LLM Guard emerged as the best overall tools showcasing the tradeoff between usability and performance. The study concluded with recommendations for greater transparency among closed source providers, improved context-aware detections, enhanced open-source engagement, increased user awareness, and the adoption of more representative performance metrics.

      Large language models (LLMs) excel at mathematical reasoning and logical problem-solving. The current popular training paradigms primarily use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the models' reasoning abilities. However, when using SFT or RL alone, there are respective challenges: SFT may suffer from overfitting, while RL is prone to mode collapse. The state-of-the-art methods have proposed hybrid training schemes. However, static switching faces challenges such as poor generalization across different tasks and high dependence on data quality. In response to these challenges, inspired by the curriculum learning-quiz mechanism in human reasoning cultivation, We propose SASR, a step-wise adaptive hybrid training framework that theoretically unifies SFT and RL and dynamically balances the two throughout optimization. SASR uses SFT for initial warm-up to establish basic reasoning skills, and then uses an adaptive dynamic adjustment algorithm based on gradient norm and divergence relative to the original distribution to seamlessly integrate SFT with the online RL method GRPO. By monitoring the training status of LLMs and adjusting the training process in sequence, SASR ensures a smooth transition between training schemes, maintaining core reasoning abilities while exploring different paths. Experimental results demonstrate that SASR outperforms SFT, RL, and static hybrid training methods.

EffiBench-X supports Python, C++, Java, JavaScript, Ruby, and Golang. It comprises competitive programming tasks with human-expert solutions as efficiency baselines. Evaluating state-of-the-art LLMs on EffiBench-X reveals that while models generate functionally correct code, they consistently underperform human experts in efficiency. Even the most efficient LLM-generated solutions (Qwen3-32B) achieve only around \textbf{62\%} of human efficiency on average, with significant language-specific variations. LLMs show better efficiency in Python, Ruby, and JavaScript than in Java, C++, and Golang. For instance, DeepSeek-R1's Python code is significantly more efficient than its Java code.

      The growing adoption of large language models (LLMs) has led to a new paradigm in mobile computing--LLM-powered mobile AI agents--capable of decomposing and automating complex tasks directly on smartphones. However, the security implications of these agents remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive security analysis of mobile LLM agents, encompassing three representative categories: System-level AI Agents developed by original equipment manufacturers (e.g., YOYO Assistant), Third-party Universal Agents (e.g., Zhipu AI AutoGLM), and Emerging Agent Frameworks (e.g., Alibaba Mobile Agent). We begin by analyzing the general workflow of mobile agents and identifying security threats across three core capability dimensions: language-based reasoning, GUI-based interaction, and system-level execution. Our analysis reveals 11 distinct attack surfaces, all rooted in the unique capabilities and interaction patterns of mobile LLM agents, and spanning their entire operational lifecycle. To investigate these threats in practice, we introduce AgentScan, a semi-automated security analysis framework that systematically evaluates mobile LLM agents across all 11 attack scenarios. Applying AgentScan to nine widely deployed agents, we uncover a concerning trend: every agent is vulnerable to targeted attacks. In the most severe cases, agents exhibit vulnerabilities across eight distinct attack vectors. These attacks can cause behavioral deviations, privacy leakage, or even full execution hijacking. Based on these findings, we propose a set of defensive design principles and practical recommendations for building secure mobile LLM agents. Our disclosures have received positive feedback from two major device vendors. Overall, this work highlights the urgent need for standardized security practices in the fast-evolving landscape of LLM-driven mobile automation.

      Inference scaling further accelerates Large Language Models (LLMs) toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), with large-scale Reinforcement Learning (RL) to unleash long Chain-of-Thought reasoning. Most contemporary reasoning approaches usually rely on handcrafted rule-based reward functions. However, the tarde-offs of exploration and exploitation in RL algorithms involves multiple complex considerations, and the theoretical and empirical impacts of manually designed reward functions remain insufficiently explored. In this paper, we propose Decoupled Group Reward Optimization (DGRO), a general RL algorithm for LLM reasoning. On the one hand, DGRO decouples the traditional regularization coefficient into two independent hyperparameters: one scales the policy gradient term, and the other regulates the distance from the sampling policy. This decoupling not only enables precise control over balancing exploration and exploitation, but also can be seamlessly extended to Online Policy Mirror Descent (OPMD) algorithms in Kimi k1.5 and Direct Reward Optimization. On the other hand, we observe that reward variance significantly affects both convergence speed and final model performance. We conduct both theoretical analysis and extensive empirical validation to assess DGRO, including a detailed ablation study that investigates its performance and optimization dynamics. Experimental results show that DGRO achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Logic dataset with an average accuracy of 96.9\%, and demonstrates strong generalization across mathematical benchmarks.

      Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a cornerstone for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), with recent innovations such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) demonstrating exceptional effectiveness. In this study, we identify a critical yet underexplored issue in RL training: low-probability tokens disproportionately influence model updates due to their large gradient magnitudes. This dominance hinders the effective learning of high-probability tokens, whose gradients are essential for LLMs' performance but are substantially suppressed. To mitigate this interference, we propose two novel methods: Advantage Reweighting and Low-Probability Token Isolation (Lopti), both of which effectively attenuate gradients from low-probability tokens while emphasizing parameter updates driven by high-probability tokens. Our approaches promote balanced updates across tokens with varying probabilities, thereby enhancing the efficiency of RL training. Experimental results demonstrate that they substantially improve the performance of GRPO-trained LLMs, achieving up to a 46.2% improvement in K&K Logic Puzzle reasoning tasks.

      Efficient LLM inference on resource-constrained devices presents significant challenges in compute and memory utilization. Due to limited GPU memory, existing systems offload model weights to CPU memory, incurring substantial I/O overhead between the CPU and GPU. This leads to two major inefficiencies: (1) GPU cores are underutilized, often remaining idle while waiting for data to be loaded; and (2) GPU memory has low impact on performance, as reducing its capacity has minimal effect on overall throughput.In this paper, we propose SpecOffload, a high-throughput inference engine that embeds speculative decoding into offloading. Our key idea is to unlock latent GPU resources for storing and executing a draft model used for speculative decoding, thus accelerating inference at near-zero additional cost. To support this, we carefully orchestrate the interleaved execution of target and draft models in speculative decoding within the offloading pipeline, and propose a planner to manage tensor placement and select optimal parameters. Compared to the best baseline, SpecOffload improves GPU core utilization by 4.49x and boosts inference throughput by 2.54x. Our code is available at https://github.com/MobiSense/SpecOffload .
