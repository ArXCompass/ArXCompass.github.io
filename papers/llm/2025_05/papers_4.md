      The emergence of agentic recommender systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) represents a paradigm shift in personalized recommendations, leveraging LLMs' advanced reasoning and role-playing capabilities to enable autonomous, adaptive decision-making. Unlike traditional recommendation approaches, agentic recommender systems can dynamically gather and interpret user-item interactions from complex environments, generating robust recommendation strategies that generalize across diverse scenarios. However, the field currently lacks standardized evaluation protocols to systematically assess these methods. To address this critical gap, we propose: (1) an interactive textual recommendation simulator incorporating rich user and item metadata and three typical evaluation scenarios (classic, evolving-interest, and cold-start recommendation tasks); (2) a unified modular framework for developing and studying agentic recommender systems; and (3) the first comprehensive benchmark comparing 10 classical and agentic recommendation methods. Our findings demonstrate the superiority of agentic systems and establish actionable design guidelines for their core components. The benchmark environment has been rigorously validated through an open challenge and remains publicly available with a continuously maintained leaderboard~\footnote[2]{https://tsinghua-fib-lab.github.io/AgentSocietyChallenge/pages/overview.html}, fostering ongoing community engagement and reproducible research. The benchmark is available at: \hyperlink{https://huggingface.co/datasets/SGJQovo/AgentRecBench}{https://huggingface.co/datasets/SGJQovo/AgentRecBench}.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      While large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis through discrete tokenization paradigms, current architectures exhibit fundamental tensions between three critical dimensions: 1) irreversible loss of acoustic characteristics caused by quantization of speech prompts; 2) stringent dependence on precisely aligned prompt speech-text pairs that limit real-world deployment; and 3) catastrophic forgetting of the LLM's native text comprehension during optimization for speech token generation. To address these challenges, we propose an LLM-based text-to-speech Generation approach Optimized via a novel dual-branch ArchiTecture (GOAT-TTS). Our framework introduces two key innovations: (1) The modality-alignment branch combines a speech encoder and projector to capture continuous acoustic embeddings, enabling bidirectional correlation between paralinguistic features (language, timbre, emotion) and semantic text representations without transcript dependency; (2) The speech-generation branch employs modular fine-tuning on top-k layers of an LLM for speech token prediction while freezing the bottom-n layers to preserve foundational linguistic knowledge. Moreover, multi-token prediction is introduced to support real-time streaming TTS synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that our GOAT-TTS achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art TTS models while validating the efficacy of synthesized dialect speech data.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      This work presents Pangu Embedded, an efficient Large Language Model (LLM) reasoner developed on Ascend Neural Processing Units (NPUs), featuring flexible fast and slow thinking capabilities. Pangu Embedded addresses the significant computational costs and inference latency challenges prevalent in existing reasoning-optimized LLMs. We propose a two-stage training framework for its construction. In Stage 1, the model is finetuned via an iterative distillation process, incorporating inter-iteration model merging to effectively aggregate complementary knowledge. This is followed by reinforcement learning on Ascend clusters, optimized by a latency-tolerant scheduler that combines stale synchronous parallelism with prioritized data queues. The RL process is guided by a Multi-source Adaptive Reward System (MARS), which generates dynamic, task-specific reward signals using deterministic metrics and lightweight LLM evaluators for mathematics, coding, and general problem-solving tasks. Stage 2 introduces a dual-system framework, endowing Pangu Embedded with a "fast" mode for routine queries and a deeper "slow" mode for complex inference. This framework offers both manual mode switching for user control and an automatic, complexity-aware mode selection mechanism that dynamically allocates computational resources to balance latency and reasoning depth. Experimental results on benchmarks including AIME 2024, GPQA, and LiveCodeBench demonstrate that Pangu Embedded with 7B parameters, outperforms similar-size models like Qwen3-8B and GLM4-9B. It delivers rapid responses and state-of-the-art reasoning quality within a single, unified model architecture, highlighting a promising direction for developing powerful yet practically deployable LLM reasoners.

      Demographics and cultural background of annotators influence the labels they assign in text annotation -- for instance, an elderly woman might find it offensive to read a message addressed to a "bro", but a male teenager might find it appropriate. It is therefore important to acknowledge label variations to not under-represent members of a society. Two research directions developed out of this observation in the context of using large language models (LLM) for data annotations, namely (1) studying biases and inherent knowledge of LLMs and (2) injecting diversity in the output by manipulating the prompt with demographic information. We combine these two strands of research and ask the question to which demographics an LLM resorts to when no demographics is given. To answer this question, we evaluate which attributes of human annotators LLMs inherently mimic. Furthermore, we compare non-demographic conditioned prompts and placebo-conditioned prompts (e.g., "you are an annotator who lives in house number 5") to demographics-conditioned prompts ("You are a 45 year old man and an expert on politeness annotation. How do you rate {instance}"). We study these questions for politeness and offensiveness annotations on the POPQUORN data set, a corpus created in a controlled manner to investigate human label variations based on demographics which has not been used for LLM-based analyses so far. We observe notable influences related to gender, race, and age in demographic prompting, which contrasts with previous studies that found no such effects.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Inductive reasoning, a cornerstone of human cognition, enables generalization from limited data but hasn't yet been fully achieved by large language models (LLMs). While modern LLMs excel at reasoning tasks, their ability to maintain stable and consistent rule abstraction under imperfect observations remains underexplored. To fill this gap, in this work, we introduce Robust Rule Induction, a task that evaluates LLMs' capability in inferring rules from data that are fused with noisy examples. To address this task, we further propose Sample-steered Rule Refinement (SRR), a method enhancing reasoning stability via observation diversification and execution-guided feedback. Experiments across arithmetic, cryptography, and list functions reveal: (1) SRR outperforms other methods with minimal performance degradation under noise; (2) Despite slight accuracy variation, LLMs exhibit instability under noise (e.g., 0% accuracy change with only 70% consistent score); (3) Counterfactual task gaps highlight LLMs' reliance on memorized patterns over genuine abstraction. Our findings challenge LLMs' reasoning robustness, revealing susceptibility to hypothesis drift and pattern overfitting, while providing empirical evidence critical for developing human-like inductive systems.

      The rapid evolution of Large Language Model (LLM) agents has highlighted critical challenges in cross-vendor service discovery, interoperability, and communication. Existing protocols like model context protocol and agent-to-agent protocol have made significant strides in standardizing interoperability between agents and tools, as well as communication among multi-agents. However, there remains a lack of standardized protocols and solutions for service discovery across different agent and tool vendors. In this paper, we propose AgentDNS, a root domain naming and service discovery system designed to enable LLM agents to autonomously discover, resolve, and securely invoke third-party agent and tool services across organizational and technological boundaries. Inspired by the principles of the traditional DNS, AgentDNS introduces a structured mechanism for service registration, semantic service discovery, secure invocation, and unified billing. We detail the architecture, core functionalities, and use cases of AgentDNS, demonstrating its potential to streamline multi-agent collaboration in real-world scenarios. The source code will be published on https://github.com/agentdns.

    <div class="paper-meta">
      📅 2025-05-28
    </div>
    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Large language models (LLMs) often suffer from catastrophic forgetting in continual learning (CL) scenarios, where performance on previously learned tasks degrades severely while training on sequentially arriving tasks. Although pioneering CL approaches using orthogonal subspaces can mitigate task interference, they typically employ fixed budget allocation, neglecting the varying complexity across tasks and layers. Besides, recent budget-adaptive tuning methods for LLMs often adopt multi-stage paradigms that decouple optimization and budget allocation. Such decoupling results in potential misalignment, which hinders those approaches' practical application in CL scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose OA-Adapter, a novel parameter-efficient approach for continual learning in LLMs that unifies dynamic budget adaptation with orthogonal subspace learning in a single end-to-end training stage. Specifically, OA-Adapter introduces a dynamic bottleneck dimension adaptation mechanism that simultaneously allocates an efficient parameter budget and optimizes task objectives without misalignment. To effectively preserve previously acquired knowledge while coordinating with the dynamic budget allocation, orthogonal constraints are applied specifically between the parameter subspace of the current task and the dynamically allocated parameter subspaces of historical tasks. Experimental results on continual learning benchmarks demonstrate that OA-Adapter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and parameter efficiency, achieving higher average accuracy while using 58.5% fewer parameters on the standard CL benchmark.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      This paper examines how LLMs handle false presuppositions and whether certain linguistic factors influence their responses to falsely presupposed content. Presuppositions subtly introduce information as given, making them highly effective at embedding disputable or false information. This raises concerns about whether LLMs, like humans, may fail to detect and correct misleading assumptions introduced as false presuppositions, even when the stakes of misinformation are high. Using a systematic approach based on linguistic presupposition analysis, we investigate the conditions under which LLMs are more or less sensitive to adopt or reject false presuppositions. Focusing on political contexts, we examine how factors like linguistic construction, political party, and scenario probability impact the recognition of false presuppositions. We conduct experiments with a newly created dataset and examine three LLMs: OpenAI's GPT-4-o, Meta's LLama-3-8B, and MistralAI's Mistral-7B-v03. Our results show that the models struggle to recognize false presuppositions, with performance varying by condition. This study highlights that linguistic presupposition analysis is a valuable tool for uncovering the reinforcement of political misinformation in LLM responses.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      This study explores an LLM's ability to learn new languages using explanations found in a grammar book$\unicode{x2014}$a process we term "explicit learning." To rigorously assess this ability, we design controlled translation experiments between English and constructed languages generated$\unicode{x2014}$by specific cryptographic means$\unicode{x2014}$out of Latin or French. Contrary to previous studies, our results demonstrate that LLMs do possess a measurable capacity for explicit learning. This ability, however, diminishes as the complexity of the linguistic phenomena to be learned increases. Supervised fine-tuning on ad hoc chains of thought significantly enhances LLM performance but struggles to generalize to typologically novel or more complex linguistic features. These findings point to the need for more diverse training sets and alternative fine-tuning strategies to further improve explicit learning by LLMs, benefiting low-resource languages typically described in grammar books but lacking extensive corpora.

      Scientific research heavily depends on suitable datasets for method validation, but existing academic platforms with dataset management like PapersWithCode suffer from inefficiencies in their manual workflow. To overcome this bottleneck, we present a system, called ChatPD, that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate dataset information extraction from academic papers and construct a structured paper-dataset network. Our system consists of three key modules: \textit{paper collection}, \textit{dataset information extraction}, and \textit{dataset entity resolution} to construct paper-dataset networks. Specifically, we propose a \textit{Graph Completion and Inference} strategy to map dataset descriptions to their corresponding entities. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ChatPD not only outperforms the existing platform PapersWithCode in dataset usage extraction but also achieves about 90\% precision and recall in entity resolution tasks. Moreover, we have deployed ChatPD to continuously extract which datasets are used in papers, and provide a dataset discovery service, such as task-specific dataset queries and similar dataset recommendations. We open source ChatPD and the current paper-dataset network on this [GitHub repository]{https://github.com/ChatPD-web/ChatPD}.

      Large language models (LLMs) risk retaining unauthorized or sensitive information from their training data, which raises privacy concerns. LLM unlearning seeks to mitigate these risks by selectively removing specified data while maintaining overall model performance. However, most existing work focus on methods to achieve effective forgetting and does not provide a detailed analysis of the retain set, the portion of training data that is not targeted for removal. In this paper, we investigate the effects of unlearning on various subsets of the retain set through a case study on entity unlearning. We introduce the Syntactically Similar Neighbor Set, a group of queries that share similar syntactic structures with the data targeted for removal, and show that this subset suffers the greatest performance drop during unlearning. Moreover, when used for regularization, this set not only preserves performance on syntactically similar queries but also delivers comparable or improved results across other data subsets. Our results highlight that syntactic similarity is a critical factor, potentially more so than domain or entity relationships, in achieving effective and practical LLM unlearning.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved impressive performance across a wide range of natural language tasks and are now widely used in real-world applications. Among them, black-box LLMs--served via APIs without access to model internals--are especially dominant due to their scalability and ease of deployment. Despite their strong capabilities, these models typically produce generalized responses that overlook personal preferences and reasoning styles. This has led to growing interest in black-box LLM personalization, which aims to tailor model outputs to user-specific context without modifying model parameters. However, existing approaches primarily focus on response-level personalization, attempting to match final outputs without modeling personal thought process. To address this limitation, we propose RPM, a framework for reasoning-level personalization that aligns the model's reasoning process with a user's personalized logic. RPM first constructs statistical user-specific factors by extracting and grouping response-influential features from user history. It then builds personalized reasoning paths that reflect how these factors are used in context. In the inference stage, RPM retrieves reasoning-aligned examples for new queries via feature-level similarity and performs inference conditioned on the structured factors and retrieved reasoning paths, enabling the model to follow user-specific reasoning trajectories. This reasoning-level personalization enhances both predictive accuracy and interpretability by grounding model outputs in user-specific logic through structured information. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks show that RPM consistently outperforms response-level personalization methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of reasoning-level personalization in black-box LLMs.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive reasoning capabilities in familiar contexts, but struggle when the context conflicts with their parametric knowledge. To investigate this phenomenon, we introduce CounterLogic, a dataset containing 1,800 examples across 9 logical schemas, explicitly designed to evaluate logical reasoning through counterfactual (hypothetical knowledge-conflicting) scenarios. Our systematic evaluation of 11 LLMs across 6 different datasets reveals a consistent performance degradation, with accuracies dropping by 27% on average when reasoning through counterfactual information. We propose Self-Segregate, a prompting method enabling metacognitive awareness (explicitly identifying knowledge conflicts) before reasoning. Our method dramatically narrows the average performance gaps from 27% to just 11%, while significantly increasing the overall accuracy (+7.5%). We discuss the implications of these findings and draw parallels to human cognitive processes, particularly on how humans disambiguate conflicting information during reasoning tasks. Our findings offer practical insights for understanding and enhancing LLMs reasoning capabilities in real-world applications, especially where models must logically reason independently of their factual knowledge.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      As large language models become increasingly prevalent, memory bandwidth constraints significantly limit inference throughput, motivating post-training quantization (PTQ). In this paper, we propose FireQ, a co-designed PTQ framework and an INT4-FP8 matrix multiplication kernel that accelerates LLM inference across all linear layers. Specifically, FireQ quantizes linear layer weights and key-values to INT4, and activations and queries to FP8, significantly enhancing throughput. Additionally, we introduce a three-stage pipelining for the prefill phase, which modifies the FlashAttention-3 kernel, effectively reducing time-to-first-token in the prefill phase. To minimize accuracy loss from quantization, we develop novel outlier smoothing techniques tailored separately for linear and attention layers. In linear layers, we explicitly use per-tensor scaling to prevent underflow caused by the FP8 quantization scaling factor of INT4 quantization, and channel-wise scaling to compensate for coarse granularity of INT4. In attention layers, we address quantization challenges posed by rotary positional embeddings (RoPE) by combining pre-RoPE and post-RoPE scaling strategies. FireQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 1.68x faster inference in feed-forward network layers on Llama2-7B and 1.26x faster prefill phase performance on Llama3-8B compared to QServe, with negligible accuracy loss.

      Recent large language models (LLMs) demonstrate multilingual abilities, yet they are English-centric due to dominance of English in training corpora. The limited resource for low-resource languages remains a crucial challenge. Code-switching (CS), a phenomenon where multilingual speakers alternate between languages in a discourse, can convey subtle cultural and linguistic nuances that can be otherwise lost in translation and elicits language-specific knowledge in human communications. In light of this, we investigate whether code-switching can 'activate', or identify and leverage knowledge for reasoning when LLMs solve low-resource language tasks. To facilitate the research, we first present EnKoQA, a synthetic English-Korean CS question-answering dataset. We provide comprehensive analysis on a variety of multilingual LLMs by subdividing activation process into knowledge identification and knowledge leveraging. Our results demonstrate that compared to English text, CS can faithfully activate knowledge inside LLMs especially on language-specific domains, suggesting the potential of code-switching on low-resource language tasks.

      Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive language capabilities but remain vulnerable to malicious prompts and jailbreaking attacks. Existing knowledge editing methods for LLM detoxification face two major challenges. First, they often rely on entity-specific localization, making them ineffective against adversarial inputs without explicit entities. Second, these methods suffer from over-editing, where detoxified models reject legitimate queries, compromising overall performance. In this paper, we propose ToxEdit, a toxicity-aware knowledge editing approach that dynamically detects toxic activation patterns during forward propagation. It then routes computations through adaptive inter-layer pathways to mitigate toxicity effectively. This design ensures precise toxicity mitigation while preserving LLMs' general capabilities. To more accurately assess over-editing, we also enhance the SafeEdit benchmark by incorporating instruction-following evaluation tasks. Experimental results on multiple LLMs demonstrate that our ToxEdit outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both detoxification performance and safeguarding general capabilities of LLMs.

We evaluate these methods using GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, o1-mini, LLaMA-3.3, and DeepSeek-R1 for translation between Italian and two Ladin variants, revealing three key findings: (1) Fragment-Shot Prompting is effective for translating into and between the studied low-resource languages, with syntactic coverage positively correlating with translation quality; (2) Models with stronger reasoning abilities make more effective use of retrieved knowledge, generally produce better translations, and enable Pivoted Fragment-Shot to significantly improve translation quality between the Ladin variants; and (3) prompt engineering offers limited, if any, improvements when translating from a low-resource to a high-resource language, where zero-shot prompting already yields satisfactory results.

      Large language models (LLMs) continue to face challenges in reliably solving reasoning tasks, particularly those that require precise rule following, as often found in mathematical reasoning. This paper introduces a novel neurosymbolic method that improves LLM reasoning by encoding hidden states into neurosymbolic vectors, enabling problem-solving within a neurosymbolic vector space. The results are decoded and merged with the original hidden state, significantly boosting the model's performance on numerical reasoning tasks. By offloading computation through neurosymbolic representations, this method enhances efficiency, reliability, and interpretability. Experimental results demonstrate an average of 88.6% lower cross-entropy loss and 15.4 times more problems correctly solved on a suite of mathematical reasoning tasks compared to chain-of-thought prompting and supervised fine-tuning (LoRA), without degrading performance on other tasks.

      Recent work suggests that large language models (LLMs) can improve performance of speech tasks compared to existing systems. To support their claims, results on LibriSpeech and Common Voice are often quoted. However, this work finds that a substantial amount of the LibriSpeech and Common Voice evaluation sets appear in public LLM pretraining corpora. This calls into question the reliability of findings drawn from these two datasets. To measure the impact of contamination, LLMs trained with or without contamination are compared, showing that a contaminated LLM is more likely to generate test sentences it has seen during training. Speech recognisers using contaminated LLMs shows only subtle differences in error rates, but assigns significantly higher probabilities to transcriptions seen during training. Results show that LLM outputs can be biased by tiny amounts of data contamination, highlighting the importance of evaluating LLM-based speech systems with held-out data.

      Large Language Models have significantly advanced natural language processing, achieving remarkable performance in tasks such as language generation, translation, and reasoning. However, their substantial computational requirements restrict deployment to high-end systems, limiting accessibility on consumer-grade devices. This challenge is especially pronounced for under-resourced languages like those spoken in the Iberian Peninsula, where relatively limited linguistic resources and benchmarks hinder effective evaluation. This work presents a comprehensive evaluation of compact state-of-the-art LLMs across several essential NLP tasks tailored for Iberian languages. The results reveal that while some models consistently excel in certain tasks, significant performance gaps remain, particularly for languages such as Basque. These findings highlight the need for further research on balancing model compactness with robust multilingual performance

      Multi-agent systems based on large language models (LLMs) advance automatic task completion in various fields, where debate is a common cooperation form for agents to solve complicated problems with reasoning and cross-review to solidify answers. Assessing the individual contributions of agents within these debates is crucial for system refinement and outcome reliability. Traditional leave-one-out (LOO) method offers a clear framework for evaluating each agent's role but face challenges in LLM-based systems due to high computational costs and associated financial implications. This paper presents introspective-leave-one-out (IntrospecLOO), a simple yet effective prompting for approximation of LOO in LLM-powered multi-agent debates. IntrospecLOO introduces an additional querying round after standard debates, prompting agents to update their answers while ignoring responses from a designated agent. This strategy effectively isolates and gauges each participant's influence at a reduced query complexity compared to the original LOO approaches. Validation through experiments on three benchmark datasets confirms the effectiveness of IntrospecLOO.

      LLMs are highly sensitive to prompt phrasing, yet standard benchmarks typically report performance using a single prompt, raising concerns about the reliability of such evaluations. In this work, we argue for a stochastic method of moments evaluation over the space of meaning-preserving prompt perturbations. We introduce a formal definition of reliable evaluation that accounts for prompt sensitivity, and suggest ReliableEval - a method for estimating the number of prompt resamplings needed to obtain meaningful results. Using our framework, we stochastically evaluate five frontier LLMs and find that even top-performing models like GPT-4o and Claude-3.7-Sonnet exhibit substantial prompt sensitivity. Our approach is model-, task-, and metric-agnostic, offering a recipe for meaningful and robust LLM evaluation.

      Recommender systems have become increasingly vital in our daily lives, helping to alleviate the problem of information overload across various user-oriented online services. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has yielded remarkable achievements, demonstrating their potential for the development of next-generation recommender systems. Despite these advancements, LLM-based recommender systems face inherent limitations stemming from their LLM backbones, particularly issues of hallucinations and the lack of up-to-date and domain-specific knowledge. Recently, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has garnered significant attention for addressing these limitations by leveraging external knowledge sources to enhance the understanding and generation of LLMs. However, vanilla RAG methods often introduce noise and neglect structural relationships in knowledge, limiting their effectiveness in LLM-based recommendations. To address these limitations, we propose to retrieve high-quality and up-to-date structure information from the knowledge graph (KG) to augment recommendations. Specifically, our approach develops a retrieval-augmented framework, termed K-RagRec, that facilitates the recommendation generation process by incorporating structure information from the external KG. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as effective surrogate models and candidate generators within global optimization frameworks for expensive blackbox functions. Despite promising results, LLM-based methods often struggle in high-dimensional search spaces or when lacking domain-specific priors, leading to sparse or uninformative suggestions. To overcome these limitations, we propose HOLLM, a novel global optimization algorithm that enhances LLM-driven sampling by partitioning the search space into promising subregions. Each subregion acts as a ``meta-arm'' selected via a bandit-inspired scoring mechanism that effectively balances exploration and exploitation. Within each selected subregion, an LLM then proposes high-quality candidate points, without any explicit domain knowledge. Empirical evaluation on standard optimization benchmarks shows that HOLLM consistently matches or surpasses leading Bayesian optimization and trust-region methods, while substantially outperforming global LLM-based sampling strategies.

      Effective engagement by large language models (LLMs) requires adapting responses to users' sociodemographic characteristics, such as age, occupation, and education level. While many real-world applications leverage dialogue history for contextualization, existing evaluations of LLMs' behavioral adaptation often focus on single-turn prompts. In this paper, we propose a framework to evaluate LLM adaptation when attributes are introduced either (1) explicitly via user profiles in the prompt or (2) implicitly through multi-turn dialogue history. We assess the consistency of model behavior across these modalities. Using a multi-agent pipeline, we construct a synthetic dataset pairing dialogue histories with distinct user profiles and employ questions from the Value Survey Module (VSM 2013) (Hofstede and Hofstede, 2016) to probe value expression. Our findings indicate that most models adjust their expressed values in response to demographic changes, particularly in age and education level, but consistency varies. Models with stronger reasoning capabilities demonstrate greater alignment, indicating the importance of reasoning in robust sociodemographic adaptation.

      While large language models (LLMs) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning excel in mathematics and coding, their potential for systematic reasoning in chemistry, a domain demanding rigorous structural analysis for real-world tasks like drug design and reaction engineering, remains untapped. Current benchmarks focus on simple knowledge retrieval, neglecting step-by-step reasoning required for complex tasks such as molecular optimization and reaction prediction. To address this, we introduce ChemCoTBench, a reasoning framework that bridges molecular structure understanding with arithmetic-inspired operations, including addition, deletion, and substitution, to formalize chemical problem-solving into transparent, step-by-step workflows. By treating molecular transformations as modular "chemical operations", the framework enables slow-thinking reasoning, mirroring the logic of mathematical proofs while grounding solutions in real-world chemical constraints. We evaluate models on two high-impact tasks: Molecular Property Optimization and Chemical Reaction Prediction. These tasks mirror real-world challenges while providing structured evaluability. By providing annotated datasets, a reasoning taxonomy, and baseline evaluations, ChemCoTBench bridges the gap between abstract reasoning methods and practical chemical discovery, establishing a foundation for advancing LLMs as tools for AI-driven scientific innovation.

      People can categorize the same entity at multiple taxonomic levels, such as basic (bear), superordinate (animal), and subordinate (grizzly bear).

We present a new Italian psycholinguistic dataset of human-generated exemplars for 187 concrete words. We then use these data to evaluate whether textual and vision LLMs produce meaningful exemplars that align with human category organization across three key tasks: exemplar generation, category induction, and typicality judgment. Our findings show a low alignment between humans and LLMs, consistent with previous studies. However, their performance varies notably across different semantic domains. Ultimately, this study highlights both the promises and the constraints of using AI-generated exemplars to support psychological and linguistic research.

      Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve complex reasoning tasks by generating intermediate reasoning steps. However, most existing approaches focus on hard token decoding, which constrains reasoning within the discrete vocabulary space and may not always be optimal. While recent efforts explore continuous-space reasoning, they often require full-model fine-tuning and suffer from catastrophic forgetting, limiting their applicability to state-of-the-art LLMs that already perform well in zero-shot settings with a proper instruction. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach for continuous-space reasoning that does not require modifying the LLM. Specifically, we employ a lightweight fixed assistant model to speculatively generate instance-specific soft thought tokens as the initial chain of thoughts, which are then mapped into the LLM's representation space via a trainable projection module. Experimental results on five reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method enhances LLM reasoning performance through supervised, parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

      Requiring a large language model (LLM) to generate intermediary reasoning steps, known as Chain of Thought (CoT), has been shown to be an effective way of boosting performance. Previous approaches have focused on generating multiple independent CoTs, combining them through ensembling or other post-hoc strategies to enhance reasoning. In this work, we introduce a novel approach where LLMs are fine-tuned to generate a sequence of Diverse Chains of Thought (DCoT) within a single inference step, which is fundamentally different from prior work that primarily operate on parallel CoT generations. DCoT allows LLMs to gain the ability to perform within-inference refinement of reasoning chains without requiring external feedback. Through a rigorous set of experiments spanning a wide range of tasks that require various reasoning types, we show that fine-tuning on DCoT improves performance over the CoT baseline across model families and scales (1.3B to 70B). These improvements are particularly impactful for tasks with a large result state space, such as those involving numeric answers. Our work is also significant because both quantitative analyses and manual evaluations reveal the observed gains stem from the models' ability to refine an initial reasoning chain by generating a second, improved chain within the same inference step, demonstrating previously elusive self-improvement.

      A major challenge in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is the issue of distribution shift. LLM alignment algorithms rely on static preference datasets, assuming that they accurately represent real-world user preferences. However, user preferences vary significantly across geographical regions, demographics, linguistic patterns, and evolving cultural trends. This preference distribution shift leads to catastrophic alignment failures in many real-world applications. We address this problem using the principled framework of distributionally robust optimization, and develop two novel distributionally robust direct preference optimization (DPO) algorithms, namely, Wasserstein DPO (WDPO) and Kullback-Leibler DPO (KLDPO). We characterize the sample complexity of learning the optimal policy parameters for WDPO and KLDPO. Moreover, we propose scalable gradient descent-style learning algorithms by developing suitable approximations for the challenging minimax loss functions of WDPO and KLDPO. Our empirical experiments using benchmark data sets and LLMs demonstrate the superior performance of WDPO and KLDPO in substantially improving the alignment when there is a preference distribution shift.

A key challenge is enabling LLMs to decide when to use textual reasoning versus code generation. While OpenAI trains models to invoke a Code Interpreter as needed, public research lacks guidance on aligning pre-trained LLMs to effectively leverage code and generalize across diverse tasks. We present R1-Code-Interpreter, an extension of a text-only LLM trained via multi-turn supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) to autonomously generate multiple code queries during step-by-step reasoning. We curate 144 reasoning and planning tasks (107 for training, 37 for testing), each with over 200 diverse questions. We fine-tune Qwen-2.5 models (3B/7B/14B) using various SFT and RL strategies, investigating different answer formats, reasoning vs. non-reasoning models, cold vs. warm starts, GRPO vs. PPO, and masked vs. unmasked code outputs. Unlike prior RL work on narrow domains, we find that Code Interpreter training is significantly harder due to high task diversity and expensive code execution, highlighting the critical role of the SFT stage. Our final model, R1-CI-14B, improves average accuracy on the 37 test tasks from 44.0\% to 64.1\%, outperforming GPT-4o (text-only: 58.6\%) and approaching GPT-4o with Code Interpreter (70.9\%), with the emergent self-checking behavior via code generation.

We also establish a high-quality physical video dataset containing diverse phyiscal actions and events to facilitate effective finetuning.

While individual model behavior has been extensively studied, the dynamics of peer influence in such systems remain underexplored. In this paper, we investigate herd behavior, the tendency of agents to align their outputs with those of their peers, within LLM-based multi-agent interactions. We present a series of controlled experiments that reveal how herd behaviors are shaped by multiple factors. First, we show that the gap between self-confidence and perceived confidence in peers significantly impacts an agent's likelihood to conform. Second, we find that the format in which peer information is presented plays a critical role in modulating the strength of herd behavior. Finally, we demonstrate that the degree of herd behavior can be systematically controlled, and that appropriately calibrated herd tendencies can enhance collaborative outcomes. These findings offer new insights into the social dynamics of LLM-based systems and open pathways for designing more effective and adaptive multi-agent collaboration frameworks.

      The rapid advancement of large language models has accelerated their application in reasoning, with strategic reasoning drawing increasing attention. To evaluate the strategic reasoning capabilities of LLMs, game theory, with its concise structure, has become the preferred approach for many researchers. However, current research typically focuses on a limited selection of games, resulting in low coverage of game types. Additionally, classic game scenarios carry risks of data leakage, and the benchmarks used often lack extensibility, rendering them inadequate for evaluating state-of-the-art models. To address these challenges, we propose TMGBench, characterized by comprehensive game type coverage, diverse scenarios and flexible game organization. Specifically, we incorporate all 144 game types summarized by the Robinson-Goforth topology of 2x2 games, constructed as classic games in our benchmark; we also synthetize diverse, higher-quality game scenarios for each classic game, which we refer to as story-based games. Lastly, to provide a sustainable evaluation framework adaptable to increasingly powerful LLMs, we treat the aforementioned games as atomic units and organize them into more complex forms through sequential, parallel, and nested structures. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of mainstream LLMs, covering tests on rational reasoning, reasoning robustness, Theory-of-Mind capabilities, and reasoning in complex game forms. The results revealed LLMs still have flaws in the accuracy and consistency of strategic reasoning processes, and their levels of mastery over Theory-of-Mind also vary. Additionally, SOTA models like o3-mini, Qwen3 and deepseek-reasoner, were also evaluated across the sequential, parallel, and nested game structures while the results highlighted the challenges posed by TMGBench.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) recently achieved great success in medical text summarization by simply using in-context learning. However, these recent efforts do not perform fine-grained evaluations under difficult settings where LLMs might fail. They typically report performance scores over the entire dataset. Through our benchmarking study, we show that LLMs show a significant performance drop for data points with high concentration of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words or with high novelty. Vocabulary adaptation is an intuitive solution to this vocabulary mismatch issue where the LLM vocabulary gets updated with certain expert domain (here, medical) words or subwords. An interesting finding from our study is that Llama-3.1, even with a vocabulary size of around 128K tokens, still faces over-fragmentation issue with medical words. To that end, we show vocabulary adaptation helps improve the LLM summarization performance even in difficult settings. Through extensive experimentation of multiple vocabulary adaptation strategies, two continual pretraining strategies, and three benchmark medical summarization datasets, we gain valuable insights into the role of vocabulary adaptation strategies for customizing LLMs to the medical domain. We also performed a human evaluation study with medical experts where they found that vocabulary adaptation results in more relevant and faithful summaries.

Current approaches predominantly rely on coarse-grained network slicing, lacking the granularity for dynamic adaptation to individual user conditions and traffic patterns. Despite the existence of a vast body of scheduling algorithms [...], their practical utilization is hindered by implementation heterogeneity, insufficient systematic evaluation in production environments, and the complexity of developing high-performance scheduler implementations.[...] To address these limitations, we propose ALLSTaR (Automated LLm-driven Scheduler generation and Testing for intent-based RAN), a novel framework leveraging LLMs for automated, intent-driven scheduler design, implementation, and evaluation.

Our implementation deploys these schedulers as O-RAN dApps, enabling on-the-fly deployment and testing on a production-grade, 5G-compliant testbed.

In this work, we study how well LLMs capture uncertainty, without explicitly being trained for that. We show that, if considering uncertainty as a linear concept in the model's latent space, it might indeed be captured, even after only pretraining. We further show that, though unintuitive, LLMs appear to capture several different types of uncertainty, each of which can be useful to predict the correctness for a specific task or benchmark. Furthermore, we provide in-depth results such as demonstrating a correlation between our correction prediction and the model's ability to abstain from misinformation using words, and the lack of impact of model scaling for capturing uncertainty. Finally, we claim that unifying the uncertainty types as a single one using instruction-tuning or [IDK]-token tuning is helpful for the model in terms of correctness prediction.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable general capabilities, but enhancing skills such as reasoning often demands substantial computational resources and may compromise their generalization. While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods offer a more resource-conscious alternative, they typically requires retraining for each LLM backbone due to architectural dependencies. To address these challenges, here we propose Universal Reasoner (UniR) - a single, lightweight, composable, and plug-and-play reasoning module that can be used with any frozen LLM to endow it with specialized reasoning capabilities. Specifically, UniR decomposes the reward into a standalone reasoning module that is trained independently using predefined rewards, effectively translating trajectory-level signals into token-level guidance. Once trained, UniR can be combined with any frozen LLM at inference time by simply adding its output logits to those of the LLM backbone. This additive structure naturally enables modular composition: multiple UniR modules trained for different tasks can be jointly applied by summing their logits, enabling complex reasoning via composition. Experimental results on mathematical reasoning and machine translation tasks show that UniR significantly outperforms existing baseline fine-tuning methods using the Llama3.2 model. Furthermore, UniR demonstrates strong weak-to-strong generalization: reasoning modules trained on smaller models effectively guide much larger LLMs. This makes UniR a cost-efficient, adaptable, and robust solution for enhancing reasoning in LLMs without compromising their core capabilities.

This study systematically examines how fine-tuning reconfigures LLM computations by isolating and analyzing instruction-specific sparse components, i.e., neurons in dense models and both neurons and experts in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. In particular, we introduce HexaInst, a carefully curated and balanced instructional dataset spanning six distinct categories, and propose SPARCOM, a novel analytical framework comprising three key contributions: (1) a method for identifying these sparse components, (2) an evaluation of their functional generality and uniqueness, and (3) a systematic comparison of their alterations. Through experiments, we demonstrate functional generality, uniqueness, and the critical role of these components in instruction execution. By elucidating the relationship between fine-tuning-induced adaptations and sparse computational substrates, this work provides deeper insights into how LLMs internalize instruction-following behavior for the trustworthy LLM community.

      A recent study showed that large language models (LLMs) can reconstruct surprisingly long texts - up to thousands of tokens - via autoregressive generation from just one specially trained input embedding. In this work, we explore whether such reconstruction is possible without autoregression. We show that frozen LLMs can generate hundreds of accurate tokens in just one forward pass, when provided with only two learned embeddings. This reveals a surprising and underexplored capability of LLMs - multi-token generation without iterative decoding. We investigate the behaviour of these embeddings and provide insight into the type of information they encode. We also empirically show that although these representations are not unique for a given text, they form connected and local regions in embedding space - a property that suggests the potential of learning a dedicated encoder into that space.

      As test-time scaling becomes a pivotal research frontier in Large Language Models (LLMs) development, contemporary and advanced post-training methodologies increasingly focus on extending the generation length of long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) responses to enhance reasoning capabilities toward DeepSeek R1-like performance. However, recent studies reveal a persistent overthinking phenomenon in state-of-the-art reasoning models, manifesting as excessive redundancy or repetitive thinking patterns in long CoT responses. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective two-stage reinforcement learning framework for achieving concise reasoning in LLMs, named ConciseR. Specifically, the first stage, using more training steps, aims to incentivize the model's reasoning capabilities via Group Relative Policy Optimization with clip-higher and dynamic sampling components (GRPO++), and the second stage, using fewer training steps, explicitly enforces conciseness and improves efficiency via Length-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (L-GRPO). Significantly, ConciseR only optimizes response length once all rollouts of a sample are correct, following the "walk before you run" principle. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our ConciseR model, which generates more concise CoT reasoning responses, outperforms recent state-of-the-art reasoning models with zero RL paradigm across AIME 2024, MATH-500, AMC 2023, Minerva, and Olympiad benchmarks.

      Multilingual LLM performance is often critically dependent on model size. With an eye on efficiency, this has led to a surge in interest in one-shot pruning methods that retain the benefits of large-scale pretraining while shrinking the model size. However, as pruning tends to come with performance loss, it is important to understand the trade-offs between multilinguality and sparsification. In this work, we study multilingual performance under different sparsity constraints and show that moderate ratios already substantially harm performance. To help bridge this gap, we propose M-Wanda, a pruning method that models cross-lingual variation by incorporating language-aware activation statistics into its pruning criterion and dynamically adjusts layerwise sparsity based on cross-lingual importance. We show that M-Wanda consistently improves performance at minimal additional costs. We are the first to explicitly optimize pruning to retain multilingual performance, and hope to inspire future advances in multilingual pruning.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Hallucinations, a phenomenon where a language model (LM) generates nonfactual content, pose a significant challenge to the practical deployment of LMs. While many empirical methods have been proposed to mitigate hallucinations, recent studies established a computability-theoretic result showing that any LM will inevitably generate hallucinations on an infinite set of inputs, regardless of the quality and quantity of training datasets and the choice of the language model architecture and training and inference algorithms. Although the computability-theoretic result may seem pessimistic, its significance in practical viewpoints has remained unclear. This paper claims that those "innate" inevitability results from computability theory and diagonal argument, in principle, cannot explain practical issues of LLMs. We demonstrate this claim by presenting a positive theoretical result from a probabilistic perspective. Specifically, we prove that hallucinations can be made statistically negligible, provided that the quality and quantity of the training data are sufficient. Interestingly, our positive result coexists with the computability-theoretic result, implying that while hallucinations on an infinite set of inputs cannot be entirely eliminated, their probability can always be reduced by improving algorithms and training data. By evaluating the two seemingly contradictory results through the lens of information theory, we argue that our probability-theoretic positive result better reflects practical considerations than the computability-theoretic negative result.

      This paper introduces ADEPT, a system using Large Language Model (LLM) personas to simulate multi-perspective ethical debates. ADEPT assembles panels of 'AI personas', each embodying a distinct ethical framework or stakeholder perspective (like a deontologist, consequentialist, or disability rights advocate), to deliberate on complex moral issues. Its application is demonstrated through a scenario about prioritizing patients for a limited number of ventilators inspired by real-world challenges in allocating scarce medical resources. Two debates, each with six LLM personas, were conducted; they only differed in the moral viewpoints represented: one included a Catholic bioethicist and a care theorist, the other substituted a rule-based Kantian philosopher and a legal adviser. Both panels ultimately favoured the same policy -- a lottery system weighted for clinical need and fairness, crucially avoiding the withdrawal of ventilators for reallocation. However, each panel reached that conclusion through different lines of argument, and their voting coalitions shifted once duty- and rights-based voices were present. Examination of the debate transcripts shows that the altered membership redirected attention toward moral injury, legal risk and public trust, which in turn changed four continuing personas' final positions. The work offers three contributions: (i) a transparent, replicable workflow for running and analysing multi-agent AI debates in bioethics; (ii) evidence that the moral perspectives included in such panels can materially change the outcome even when the factual inputs remain constant; and (iii) an analysis of the implications and future directions for such AI-mediated approaches to ethical deliberation and policy.

      System prompts in Large Language Models (LLMs) are predefined directives that guide model behaviour, taking precedence over user inputs in text processing and generation. LLM deployers increasingly use them to ensure consistent responses across contexts. While model providers set a foundation of system prompts, deployers and third-party developers can append additional prompts without visibility into others' additions, while this layered implementation remains entirely hidden from end-users. As system prompts become more complex, they can directly or indirectly introduce unaccounted for side effects. This lack of transparency raises fundamental questions about how the position of information in different directives shapes model outputs. As such, this work examines how the placement of information affects model behaviour. To this end, we compare how models process demographic information in system versus user prompts across six commercially available LLMs and 50 demographic groups. Our analysis reveals significant biases, manifesting in differences in user representation and decision-making scenarios. Since these variations stem from inaccessible and opaque system-level configurations, they risk representational, allocative and potential other biases and downstream harms beyond the user's ability to detect or correct. Our findings draw attention to these critical issues, which have the potential to perpetuate harms if left unexamined. Further, we argue that system prompt analysis must be incorporated into AI auditing processes, particularly as customisable system prompts become increasingly prevalent in commercial AI deployments.

      Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved impressive performance across a wide range of natural language tasks and are now widely used in real-world applications. Among them, black-box LLMs--served via APIs without access to model internals--are especially dominant due to their scalability and ease of deployment. Despite their strong capabilities, these models typically produce generalized responses that overlook personal preferences and reasoning styles. This has led to growing interest in black-box LLM personalization, which aims to tailor model outputs to user-specific context without modifying model parameters. However, existing approaches primarily focus on response-level personalization, attempting to match final outputs without modeling personal thought process. To address this limitation, we propose RPM, a framework for reasoning-level personalization that aligns the model's reasoning process with a user's personalized logic. RPM first constructs statistical user-specific factors by extracting and grouping response-influential features from user history. It then builds personalized reasoning paths that reflect how these factors are used in context. In the inference stage, RPM retrieves reasoning-aligned examples for new queries via feature-level similarity and performs inference conditioned on the structured factors and retrieved reasoning paths, enabling the model to follow user-specific reasoning trajectories. This reasoning-level personalization enhances both predictive accuracy and interpretability by grounding model outputs in user-specific logic through structured information. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks show that RPM consistently outperforms response-level personalization methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of reasoning-level personalization in black-box LLMs.

ScaleQuest introduces a two-stage question-tuning process comprising Question Fine-Tuning (QFT) and Question Preference Optimization (QPO) to unlock the question generation capabilities of problem-solving models. By generating diverse questions from scratch -- without relying on powerful proprietary models or seed data -- we produce a dataset of 1 million problem-solution pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that models trained on our data outperform existing open-source datasets in both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations. Furthermore, our approach shows continued performance improvement as the volume of training data increases, highlighting its potential for ongoing data scaling. The extensive improvements observed in code reasoning tasks demonstrate the generalization capabilities of our proposed method.

However, automating the building process for C/C++ projects is a highly complex endeavor, involving tremendous technical challenges, such as intricate dependency management, diverse build systems, varied toolchains, and multifaceted error handling mechanisms. Consequently, building C/C++ projects often proves to be difficult in practice, hindering the progress of downstream applications. Unfortunately, research on facilitating the building of C/C++ projects remains to be inadequate. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers promising solutions to automated software building. Trained on extensive corpora, LLMs can help unify diverse build systems through their comprehension capabilities and address complex errors by leveraging tacit knowledge storage. Moreover, LLM-based agents can be systematically designed to dynamically interact with the environment, effectively managing dynamic building issues. Motivated by these opportunities, we first conduct an empirical study to systematically analyze the current challenges in the C/C++ project building process.

Our evaluation on open-source software demonstrates that CXXCrafter achieves a success rate of 78% in project building.

      While fine-tuning LLMs on NLI corpora improves their inferential performance, the underlying mechanisms driving this improvement remain largely opaque. In this work, we conduct a series of experiments to investigate what LLMs actually learn during fine-tuning. We begin by analyzing predicate frequencies in premises and hypotheses across NLI datasets and identify a consistent frequency bias, where predicates in hypotheses occur more frequently than those in premises for positive instances. To assess the impact of this bias, we evaluate both standard and NLI fine-tuned LLMs on bias-consistent and bias-adversarial cases. We find that LLMs exploit frequency bias for inference and perform poorly on adversarial instances. Furthermore, fine-tuned LLMs exhibit significantly increased reliance on this bias, suggesting that they are learning these frequency patterns from datasets. Finally, we compute the frequencies of hyponyms and their corresponding hypernyms from WordNet, revealing a correlation between frequency bias and textual entailment. These findings help explain why learning frequency patterns can enhance model performance on inference tasks.

      Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a dominant AI paradigm due to their exceptional text understanding and generation capabilities. However, their tendency to generate inconsistent or erroneous outputs challenges their reliability, especially in high-stakes domains requiring accuracy and trustworthiness. Existing research primarily focuses on detecting and mitigating model misbehavior in general-purpose scenarios, often overlooking the potential of integrating domain-specific knowledge. In this work, we advance misbehavior detection by incorporating domain knowledge. The core idea is to design a general specification language that enables domain experts to customize domain-specific predicates in a lightweight and intuitive manner, supporting later runtime verification of LLM outputs. To achieve this, we design a novel specification language, ESL, and introduce a runtime verification framework, RvLLM, to validate LLM output against domain-specific constraints defined in ESL. We evaluate RvLLM on three representative tasks: violation detection against Singapore Rapid Transit Systems Act, numerical comparison, and inequality solving. Experimental results demonstrate that RvLLM effectively detects erroneous outputs across various LLMs in a lightweight and flexible manner. The results reveal that despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs remain prone to low-level errors due to limited interpretability and a lack of formal guarantees during inference, and our framework offers a potential long-term solution by leveraging expert domain knowledge to rigorously and efficiently verify LLM outputs.

We investigate automatic treebank generation by large language models (LLMs) in this paper. The performance of LLMs on constituency parsing is poor, therefore we propose a novel treebank generation method, LLM back generation, which is similar to the reverse process of constituency parsing. LLM back generation takes the incomplete cross-domain constituency tree with only domain keyword leaf nodes as input and fills the missing words to generate the cross-domain constituency treebank. Besides, we also introduce a span-level contrastive learning pre-training strategy to make full use of the LLM back generation treebank for cross-domain constituency parsing. We verify the effectiveness of our LLM back generation treebank coupled with contrastive learning pre-training on five target domains of MCTB. Experimental results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on average results compared with various baselines.

Meanwhile, knowledge graphs (KGs) provide structured factual knowledge but lack the flexible reasoning abilities of LLMs. In this paper, we present Reason-Align-Respond (RAR), a novel framework that systematically integrates LLM reasoning with knowledge graphs for KGQA. Our approach consists of three key components: a Reasoner that generates human-like reasoning chains, an Aligner that maps these chains to valid KG paths, and a Responser that synthesizes the final answer. We formulate this process as a probabilistic model and optimize it using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, which iteratively refines the reasoning chains and knowledge paths. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of RAR, achieving state-of-the-art performance with Hit@1 scores of 93.3% and 91.0% on WebQSP and CWQ respectively. Human evaluation confirms that RAR generates high-quality, interpretable reasoning chains well-aligned with KG paths.

A prominent example is the "lost in the middle" phenomenon, where LLMs struggle to utilize relevant information situated in the middle of the input. While prior research primarily focuses on single pieces of relevant information, real-world applications often involve multiple relevant information pieces. To bridge this gap, we present LongPiBench, a benchmark designed to assess positional bias involving multiple pieces of relevant information. Thorough experiments are conducted with five commercial and six open-source models. These experiments reveal that while most current models are robust against the "lost in the middle" issue, there exist significant biases related to the spacing of relevant information pieces.

      LLM providers typically offer multiple LLM tiers, varying in performance and price. As NLP tasks become more complex and modularized, selecting the suitable LLM tier for each subtask is a key challenge to balance between cost and performance. To address the problem, we introduce LLM Automatic Transmission (LLM-AT) framework that automatically selects LLM tiers without training. LLM-AT consists of Starter, Generator, and Judge. The starter selects the initial LLM tier expected to solve the given question, the generator produces a response using the LLM of the selected tier, and the judge evaluates the validity of the response. If the response is invalid, LLM-AT iteratively upgrades to a higher-tier model, generates a new response, and re-evaluates until a valid response is obtained. Additionally, we propose accuracy estimator, which enables the suitable initial LLM tier selection without training. Given an input question, accuracy estimator estimates the expected accuracy of each LLM tier by computing the valid response rate across top-k similar queries from past inference records. Experiments demonstrate that LLM-AT achieves superior performance while reducing costs, making it a practical solution for real-world applications.

In this work, we demonstrate how LLMs can use their compressed world knowledge to generate intrinsically interpretable machine learning models, i.e., decision trees, without any training data. We find that these zero-shot decision trees can even surpass data-driven trees on some small-sized tabular datasets and that embeddings derived from these trees perform better than data-driven tree-based embeddings on average. Our decision tree induction and embedding approaches can therefore serve as new knowledge-driven baselines for data-driven machine learning methods in the low-data regime. Furthermore, they offer ways to harness the rich world knowledge within LLMs for tabular machine learning tasks. Our code and results are available at https://github.com/ml-lab-htw/llm-trees.

      Fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) often demonstrate poor calibration, with their confidence scores misaligned with actual performance. While calibration has been extensively studied in models trained from scratch, the impact of LLMs' prior knowledge on calibration during fine-tuning remains understudied. Our research reveals that LLMs' prior knowledge causes potential poor calibration due to the ubiquitous presence of known data in real-world fine-tuning, which appears harmful for calibration. Specifically, data aligned with LLMs' prior knowledge would induce overconfidence, while new knowledge improves calibration. Our findings expose a tension: LLMs' encyclopedic knowledge, while enabling task versatility, undermines calibration through unavoidable knowledge overlaps. To address this, we propose CogCalib, a cognition-aware framework that applies targeted learning strategies according to the model's prior knowledge. Experiments across 7 tasks using 3 LLM families prove that CogCalib significantly improves calibration while maintaining performance, achieving an average 57\% reduction in ECE compared to standard fine-tuning in Llama3-8B. These improvements generalize well to out-of-domain tasks, enhancing the objectivity and reliability of domain-specific LLMs, and making them more trustworthy for critical human-AI interaction applications.

      Quantizing large language models (LLMs) to 1-bit precision significantly reduces computational costs, but existing quantization techniques suffer from noticeable performance degradation when using weight and activation precisions below 4 bits (W4A4). In this paper, we propose a post-training quantization framework with W(1+1)A(1*4) configuration, where weights are quantized to 1 bit with an additional 1 bit for fine-grain grouping and activations are quantized to 1 bit with a 4-fold increase in the number of channels. For weight quantization, we propose utilizing Hessian-aware fine-grained grouping along with an EM-based quantization scheme. For activation quantization, we decompose INT4-quantized activations into a 4 * INT1 format equivalently and simultaneously smooth the scaling factors based on quantization errors, which further reduces the quantization errors in activations. Our method surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLM quantization baselines on W2A4 across multiple tasks, pushing the boundaries of existing LLM quantization methods toward fully binarized models.

      Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has proven effective in improving the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) during inference. However, existing research has overlooked the efficiency of TTS from a latency-sensitive perspective. Through a latency-aware evaluation of representative TTS methods, we demonstrate that a compute-optimal TTS does not always result in the lowest latency in scenarios where latency is critical. To address this gap and achieve latency-optimal TTS, we propose two key approaches by optimizing the concurrency configurations: (1) branch-wise parallelism, which leverages multiple concurrent inference branches, and (2) sequence-wise parallelism, enabled by speculative decoding. By integrating these two approaches and allocating computational resources properly to each, our latency-optimal TTS enables a 32B model to reach 82.3% accuracy on MATH-500 within 1 minute and a smaller 3B model to achieve 72.4% within 10 seconds. Our work emphasizes the importance of latency-aware TTS and demonstrates its ability to deliver both speed and accuracy in latency-sensitive scenarios.

      Maintaining consistent model performance across domains is a fundamental challenge in machine learning. While recent work has explored using LLM-generated data for fine-tuning, its impact on cross-domain generalization remains poorly understood. This paper presents a systematic analysis revealing that fine-tuning with LLM-generated data not only improves target task performance but also reduces non-target task degradation compared to fine-tuning with ground truth data. Through analyzing the data sequence in tasks of various domains, we demonstrate that this enhancement of non-target task robustness stems from the reduction of high perplexity tokens found in LLM-generated sequences. Following our findings, we showed that masking high perplexity tokens in ground truth training data achieves similar non-target task performance preservation, comparable to using LLM-generated data. Extensive experiments across different model families and scales, including Gemma 2 IT 2B, Llama 3 8B Instruct, and 3 additional models, agree with our findings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide an empirical explanation based on token perplexity reduction to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in LLMs after fine-tuning, offering valuable insights for developing more robust fine-tuning strategies.

      The widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) has increased the importance of demand response in smart grids. This paper proposes a two-layer demand response optimization framework for EV users and aggregators, leveraging large language models (LLMs) to balance electricity supply and demand and optimize energy utilization during EV charging. The upper-layer model, focusing on the aggregator, aims to maximize profits by adjusting retail electricity prices. The lower-layer model targets EV users, using LLMs to simulate charging demands under varying electricity prices and optimize both costs and user comfort. The study employs a multi-threaded LLM decision generator to dynamically analyze user behavior, charging preferences, and psychological factors. The framework utilizes the PSO method to optimize electricity prices, ensuring user needs are met while increasing aggregator profits. Simulation results show that the proposed model improves EV charging efficiency, alleviates peak power loads, and stabilizes smart grid operations.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are predominantly evaluated on Standard American English (SAE), often overlooking the diversity of global English varieties. This narrow focus may raise fairness concerns as degraded performance on non-standard varieties can lead to unequal benefits for users worldwide. Therefore, it is critical to extensively evaluate the linguistic robustness of LLMs on multiple non-standard English varieties. We introduce Trans-EnV, a framework that automatically transforms SAE datasets into multiple English varieties to evaluate the linguistic robustness. Our framework combines (1) linguistics expert knowledge to curate variety-specific features and transformation guidelines from linguistic literature and corpora, and (2) LLM-based transformations to ensure both linguistic validity and scalability. Using Trans-EnV, we transform six benchmark datasets into 38 English varieties and evaluate seven state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results reveal significant performance disparities, with accuracy decreasing by up to 46.3% on non-standard varieties. These findings highlight the importance of comprehensive linguistic robustness evaluation across diverse English varieties.

      Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in tasks such as code and mathematics. However, their potential to internalize structured spatial knowledge remains underexplored. This study investigates whether LLMs, grounded in locally relative human observations, can construct coherent global spatial cognition by integrating fragmented relational descriptions. We focus on two core aspects of spatial cognition: spatial perception, where models infer consistent global layouts from local positional relationships, and spatial navigation, where models learn road connectivity from trajectory data and plan optimal paths between unconnected locations. Experiments conducted in a simulated urban environment demonstrate that LLMs not only generalize to unseen spatial relationships between points of interest (POIs) but also exhibit latent representations aligned with real-world spatial distributions. Furthermore, LLMs can learn road connectivity from trajectory descriptions, enabling accurate path planning and dynamic spatial awareness during navigation.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated formidable capabilities in solving mathematical problems, yet they may still commit logical reasoning and computational errors during the problem-solving process. Thus, this paper proposes a framework, MATH-VF, which includes a Formalizer and a Critic, for formally verifying the correctness of the solutions generated by large language models. Our framework first utilizes a Formalizer which employs an LLM to translate a natural language solution into a formal context. Afterward, our Critic (which integrates various external tools such as a Computer Algebra System and an SMT solver) evaluates the correctness of each statement within the formal context, and when a statement is incorrect, our Critic provides corrective feedback. We empirically investigate the effectiveness of MATH-VF in two scenarios: 1) Verification: MATH-VF is utilized to determine the correctness of a solution to a given problem. 2) Refinement: When MATH-VF identifies errors in the solution generated by an LLM-based solution generator for a given problem, it submits the corrective suggestions proposed by the Critic to the solution generator to regenerate the solution. We evaluate our framework on widely used mathematical benchmarks: MATH500 and ProcessBench, demonstrating the superiority of our approach over existing approaches.

      Encrypted traffic classification is highly challenging in network security due to the need for extracting robust features from content-agnostic traffic data. Existing approaches face critical issues: (i) Distribution drift, caused by reliance on the closedworld assumption, limits adaptability to realworld, shifting patterns; (ii) Dependence on labeled data restricts applicability where such data is scarce or unavailable. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in offering generalizable solutions across a wide range of tasks, achieving notable success in various specialized fields. However, their effectiveness in traffic analysis remains constrained by challenges in adapting to the unique requirements of the traffic domain. In this paper, we introduce a novel traffic representation model named Encrypted Traffic Out-of-Distribution Instruction Tuning with LLM (ETooL), which integrates LLMs with knowledge of traffic structures through a self-supervised instruction tuning paradigm. This framework establishes connections between textual information and traffic interactions. ETooL demonstrates more robust classification performance and superior generalization in both supervised and zero-shot traffic classification tasks. Notably, it achieves significant improvements in F1 scores: APP53 (I.I.D.) to 93.19%(6.62%) and 92.11%(4.19%), APP53 (O.O.D.) to 74.88%(18.17%) and 72.13%(15.15%), and ISCX-Botnet (O.O.D.) to 95.03%(9.16%) and 81.95%(12.08%). Additionally, we construct NETD, a traffic dataset designed to support dynamic distributional shifts, and use it to validate ETooL's effectiveness under varying distributional conditions. Furthermore, we evaluate the efficiency gains achieved through ETooL's instruction tuning approach.

      Despite remarkable advances in the field, LLMs remain unreliable in distinguishing causation from correlation. Recent results from the Corr2Cause dataset benchmark reveal that state-of-the-art LLMs -- such as GPT-4 (F1 score: 29.08) -- only marginally outperform random baselines (Random Uniform, F1 score: 20.38), indicating limited capacity of generalization. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel structured approach: rather than directly answering causal queries, we provide the model with the capability to structure its thinking by guiding the model to build a structured knowledge graph, systematically encoding the provided correlational premises, to answer the causal queries. This intermediate representation significantly enhances the model's causal capabilities. Experiments on the test subset of the Corr2Cause dataset benchmark with Qwen3-32B model (reasoning model) show substantial gains over standard direct prompting methods, improving F1 scores from 32.71 to 48.26 (over 47.5% relative increase), along with notable improvements in precision and recall. These results underscore the effectiveness of providing the model with the capability to structure its thinking and highlight its promising potential for broader generalization across diverse causal inference tasks.

      Machine unlearning aims to selectively remove targeted knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs), ensuring they forget specified content while retaining essential information. Existing unlearning metrics assess whether a model correctly answers retain queries and rejects forget queries, but they fail to capture real-world scenarios where forget queries rarely appear in isolation. In fact, forget and retain queries often coexist within the same prompt, making mixed-query evaluation crucial. We introduce SEPS, an evaluation framework that explicitly measures a model's ability to both forget and retain information within a single prompt. Through extensive experiments across three benchmarks, we identify two key failure modes in existing unlearning methods: (1) untargeted unlearning indiscriminately erases both forget and retain content once a forget query appears, and (2) targeted unlearning overfits to single-query scenarios, leading to catastrophic failures when handling multiple queries. To address these issues, we propose Mixed Prompt (MP) unlearning, a strategy that integrates both forget and retain queries into a unified training objective. Our approach significantly improves unlearning effectiveness, demonstrating robustness even in complex settings with up to eight mixed forget and retain queries in a single prompt.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) and other automated techniques have been increasingly used to support software developers by generating software artifacts such as code snippets, patches, and comments. However, accurately assessing the correctness of these generated artifacts remains a significant challenge. On one hand, human evaluation provides high accuracy but is labor-intensive and lacks scalability. On the other hand, other existing automatic evaluation metrics are scalable and require minimal human effort, but they often fail to accurately reflect the actual correctness of generated software artifacts. In this paper, we present SWE-Judge, the first evaluation metric for LLM-as-Ensemble-Judge specifically designed to accurately assess the correctness of generated software artifacts. SWE-Judge first defines five distinct evaluation strategies, each implemented as an independent judge. A dynamic team selection mechanism then identifies the most appropriate subset of judges to produce a final correctness score through ensembling. We evaluate SWE-Judge across a diverse set of software engineering (SE) benchmarks, including CoNaLa, Card2Code, HumanEval-X, APPS, APR-Assess, and Summary-Assess. These benchmarks span three SE tasks: code generation, automated program repair, and code summarization. Experimental results demonstrate that SWE-Judge consistently achieves a higher correlation with human judgments, with improvements ranging from 5.9% to 183.8% over existing automatic metrics. Furthermore, SWE-Judge reaches agreement levels with human annotators that are comparable to inter-annotator agreement in code generation and program repair tasks. These findings underscore SWE-Judge's potential as a scalable and reliable alternative to human evaluation.

To address this, LLM-based judges have been proposed, which compare the outputs of two LLMs enabling the ranking of models without human intervention. While several approaches have been proposed, many confounding factors are present between different papers. For instance the model, the prompt and other hyperparameters are typically changed at the same time making apple-to-apple comparisons challenging.

To alleviate the high cost of evaluating a judge, we propose to leverage multi-objective multi-fidelity which allows to find judges that trade accuracy for cost and also significantly reduce the cost of the search. Our method identifies judges that not only outperform existing benchmarks in accuracy and cost-efficiency but also utilize open-weight models, ensuring greater accessibility and reproducibility.

In this paper, we propose FireQ, a co-designed PTQ framework and an INT4-FP8 matrix multiplication kernel that accelerates LLM inference across all linear layers. Specifically, FireQ quantizes linear layer weights and key-values to INT4, and activations and queries to FP8, significantly enhancing throughput. Additionally, we introduce a three-stage pipelining for the prefill phase, which modifies the FlashAttention-3 kernel, effectively reducing time-to-first-token in the prefill phase. To minimize accuracy loss from quantization, we develop novel outlier smoothing techniques tailored separately for linear and attention layers. In linear layers, we explicitly use per-tensor scaling to prevent underflow caused by the FP8 quantization scaling factor of INT4 quantization, and channel-wise scaling to compensate for coarse granularity of INT4. In attention layers, we address quantization challenges posed by rotary positional embeddings (RoPE) by combining pre-RoPE and post-RoPE scaling strategies. FireQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 1.68x faster inference in feed-forward network layers on Llama2-7B and 1.26x faster prefill phase performance on Llama3-8B compared to QServe, with negligible accuracy loss.

      Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to tackle complex tasks, driven by their expanding applications and users' growing proficiency in crafting sophisticated prompts. However, as the number of explicitly stated requirements increases (particularly more than 10 constraints), LLMs often struggle to accurately follow such complex instructions. To address this challenge, we propose RECAST, a novel framework for synthesizing datasets where each example incorporates far more constraints than those in existing benchmarks. These constraints are extracted from real-world prompt-response pairs to ensure practical relevance. RECAST enables automatic verification of constraint satisfaction via rule-based validators for quantitative constraints and LLM-based validators for qualitative ones. Using this framework, we construct RECAST-30K, a large-scale, high-quality dataset comprising 30k instances spanning 15 constraint types. Experimental results demonstrate that models fine-tuned on RECAST-30K show substantial improvements in following complex instructions. Moreover, the verifiability provided by RECAST enables the design of reward functions for reinforcement learning, which further boosts model performance on complex and challenging tasks.

Coupled with this dataset, we develop an end-to-end attack-defense evaluation pipeline to systematically analyze how four representative multi-agent topologies (Layers, SharedPool, Centralized, and Decentralized) withstand attacks from 'dark-personality' agents. Our findings reveal critical differences in how these architectures handle information contamination and maintain robust decision-making, exposing their underlying vulnerability mechanisms. For instance, SharedPool's open information sharing makes it highly susceptible, whereas Decentralized architectures exhibit greater resilience thanks to inherent redundancy and isolation. To mitigate these risks, we propose a personality-scale detection and correction mechanism that identifies and rehabilitates malicious agents, restoring system safety to near-baseline levels. MedSentry thus furnishes both a rigorous evaluation framework and practical defense strategies that guide the design of safer LLM-based multi-agent systems in medical domains.

Experiments show that SENSE consistently improves LLMs' performance across various tasks, highlighting the potential of integrating semantic information to improve LLM capabilities.

Our findings address four research questions: LRMs surpass LLMs in reasoning-intensive tasks like Plan Design, leveraging iterative reflection for superior outcomes; LLMs excel in execution-driven tasks such as Tool Usage, prioritizing efficiency; hybrid LLM-LRM configurations, pairing LLMs as actors with LRMs as reflectors, optimize agent performance by blending execution speed with reasoning depth; and LRMs' enhanced reasoning incurs higher computational costs, prolonged processing, and behavioral challenges, including overthinking and fact-ignoring tendencies. This study fosters deeper inquiry into LRMs' balance of deep thinking and overthinking, laying a critical foundation for future agent design advancements.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks, yet they often exhibit a specific cultural biases, neglecting the values and linguistic diversity of low-resource regions. This cultural bias not only undermines universal equality, but also risks reinforcing stereotypes and perpetuating discrimination. To address this, we propose CulFiT, a novel culturally-aware training paradigm that leverages multilingual data and fine-grained reward modeling to enhance cultural sensitivity and inclusivity. Our approach synthesizes diverse cultural-related questions, constructs critique data in culturally relevant languages, and employs fine-grained rewards to decompose cultural texts into verifiable knowledge units for interpretable evaluation. We also introduce GlobalCultureQA, a multilingual open-ended question-answering dataset designed to evaluate culturally-aware responses in a global context. Extensive experiments on three existing benchmarks and our GlobalCultureQA demonstrate that CulFiT achieves state-of-the-art open-source model performance in cultural alignment and general reasoning.

      Large language models (LLMs) excel at mathematical reasoning and logical problem-solving. The current popular training paradigms primarily use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the models' reasoning abilities. However, when using SFT or RL alone, there are respective challenges: SFT may suffer from overfitting, while RL is prone to mode collapse. The state-of-the-art methods have proposed hybrid training schemes. However, static switching faces challenges such as poor generalization across different tasks and high dependence on data quality. In response to these challenges, inspired by the curriculum learning-quiz mechanism in human reasoning cultivation, We propose SASR, a step-wise adaptive hybrid training framework that theoretically unifies SFT and RL and dynamically balances the two throughout optimization. SASR uses SFT for initial warm-up to establish basic reasoning skills, and then uses an adaptive dynamic adjustment algorithm based on gradient norm and divergence relative to the original distribution to seamlessly integrate SFT with the online RL method GRPO. By monitoring the training status of LLMs and adjusting the training process in sequence, SASR ensures a smooth transition between training schemes, maintaining core reasoning abilities while exploring different paths. Experimental results demonstrate that SASR outperforms SFT, RL, and static hybrid training methods.

      Role-playing enables large language models (LLMs) to engage users in immersive and personalized interactions, but it also introduces significant safety risks. Existing role-play fine-tuning techniques improve role adaptability but may degrade safety performance, particularly for villainous characters. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive assessment of role-play fine-tuning risks by training 95 role-specific LLMs using RoleBench. Our experiments reveal that role-play fine-tuning leads to a noticeable decline in safety performance, with safety risks varying based on character traits. To tackle this challenge, we propose Safety-Aware Role-Play Fine-Tuning (SaRFT), a novel method designed to balance role-playing capabilities and safety. Extensive experiments on LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct, Gemma-2-9B-it, and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct demonstrate that SaRFT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under both LoRA and full-parameter fine-tuning settings. Our findings highlight the necessity of role-adaptive safety measures and provide insights into mitigating role-specific safety risks in role-playing LLMs.

      Recent years have witnessed extensive exploration of Large Language Models (LLMs) on the field of Recommender Systems (RS). There are currently two commonly used strategies to enable LLMs to have recommendation capabilities: 1) The "Guidance-Only" strategy uses in-context learning to exploit and amplify the inherent semantic understanding and item recommendation capabilities of LLMs; 2) The "Tuning-Only" strategy uses supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to fine-tune LLMs with the aim of fitting them to real recommendation data. However, neither of these strategies can effectively bridge the gap between the knowledge space of LLMs and recommendation, and their performance do not meet our expectations. To better enable LLMs to learn recommendation knowledge, we combine the advantages of the above two strategies and proposed a novel "Guidance+Tuning" method called Self-Optimized Fine-Tuning (SOFT), which adopts the idea of curriculum learning. It first employs self-distillation to construct an auxiliary easy-to-learn but meaningful dataset from a fine-tuned LLM. Then it further utilizes a self-adaptive curriculum scheduler to enable LLMs to gradually learn from simpler data (self-distilled data) to more challenging data (real RS data). Extensive experiments demonstrate that SOFT significantly enhances the recommendation accuracy (37.59\% on average) of LLM-based methods.

      Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing large language models (LLMs) in code generation and optimization. This survey systematically reviews RL-driven techniques across the code development lifecycle, from compiler-level optimizations and resource allocation strategies to end-to-end code synthesis frameworks. We first examine classical and modern RL algorithms -- spanning policy gradients, actor-critic methods, human-feedback alignment, and preference-based optimization -- and their adaptations to the unique challenges of code generation, such as sparse and delayed rewards. Next, we analyze key benchmarks, datasets, and evaluation metrics that drive progress in RL-augmented Code LLMs. Finally, we identify open problems, including the need for richer feedback sources, support for low-level and domain-specific languages, and methods to reduce computational overhead. By consolidating current insights and outlining future directions, this work aims to guide researchers and practitioners in leveraging RL to produce more robust, efficient, and human-aligned code generation systems.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve superior performance through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, but these token-level reasoning chains are computationally expensive and inefficient. In this paper, we introduce Compressed Latent Reasoning (CoLaR), a novel framework that dynamically compresses reasoning processes in latent space through a two-stage training approach. First, during supervised fine-tuning, CoLaR extends beyond next-token prediction by incorporating an auxiliary next compressed embedding prediction objective. This process merges embeddings of consecutive tokens using a compression factor randomly sampled from a predefined range, and trains a specialized latent head to predict distributions of subsequent compressed embeddings. Second, we enhance CoLaR through reinforcement learning (RL) that leverages the latent head's non-deterministic nature to explore diverse reasoning paths and exploit more compact ones. This approach enables CoLaR to: i) perform reasoning at a dense latent level (i.e., silently), substantially reducing reasoning chain length, and ii) dynamically adjust reasoning speed at inference time by simply prompting the desired compression factor. Extensive experiments across four mathematical reasoning datasets demonstrate that CoLaR achieves 14.1% higher accuracy than latent-based baseline methods at comparable compression ratios, and reduces reasoning chain length by 53.3% with only 4.8% performance degradation compared to explicit CoT method. Moreover, when applied to more challenging mathematical reasoning tasks, our RL-enhanced CoLaR demonstrates performance gains of up to 5.4% while dramatically reducing latent reasoning chain length by 82.8%. The code and models will be released upon acceptance.

      Advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have increased the performance of different natural language understanding as well as generation tasks. Although LLMs have breached the state-of-the-art performance in various tasks, they often reflect different forms of bias present in the training data. In the light of this perceived limitation, we provide a unified evaluation of benchmarks using a set of representative small and medium-sized LLMs that cover different forms of biases starting from physical characteristics to socio-economic categories. Moreover, we propose five prompting approaches to carry out the bias detection task across different aspects of bias. Further, we formulate three research questions to gain valuable insight in detecting biases in LLMs using different approaches and evaluation metrics across benchmarks. The results indicate that each of the selected LLMs suffer from one or the other form of bias with the Phi-3.5B model being the least biased. Finally, we conclude the paper with the identification of key challenges and possible future directions.

      Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited extraordinary performance in a variety of tasks while it remains challenging for them to solve complex multi-step tasks as agents. In practice, agents sensitive to the outcome of certain key steps which makes them likely to fail the task because of a subtle mistake in the planning trajectory. Recent approaches resort to calibrating the reasoning process through reinforcement learning. They reward or penalize every reasoning step with process supervision, as known as Process Reward Models (PRMs). However, PRMs are difficult and costly to scale up with a large number of next action candidates since they require extensive computations to acquire the training data through the per-step trajectory exploration. To mitigate this issue, we focus on the relative reward trend across successive reasoning steps and propose maintaining an increasing reward in the collected trajectories for process supervision, which we term Reward Rising Optimization (RRO). Specifically, we incrementally augment the process supervision until identifying a step exhibiting positive reward differentials, i.e. rising rewards, relative to its preceding iteration. This method dynamically expands the search space for the next action candidates, efficiently capturing high-quality data. We provide mathematical groundings and empirical results on the WebShop and InterCode-SQL benchmarks, showing that our proposed RRO achieves superior performance while requiring much less exploration cost.

      Reinforcement learning (RL) holds significant promise for training LLM agents to handle complex, goal-oriented tasks that require multi-step interactions with external environments. However, a critical challenge when applying RL to these agentic tasks arises from delayed rewards: feedback signals are typically available only after the entire task is completed. This makes it non-trivial to assign delayed rewards to earlier actions, providing insufficient guidance regarding environmental constraints and hindering agent training. In this work, we draw on the insight that the ultimate completion of a task emerges from the cumulative progress an agent makes across individual steps. We propose Stepwise Progress Attribution (SPA), a general reward redistribution framework that decomposes the final reward into stepwise contributions, each reflecting its incremental progress toward overall task completion. To achieve this, we train a progress estimator that accumulates stepwise contributions over a trajectory to match the task completion. During policy optimization, we combine the estimated per-step contribution with a grounding signal for actions executed in the environment as the fine-grained, intermediate reward for effective agent training. Extensive experiments on common agent benchmarks (including Webshop, ALFWorld, and VirtualHome) demonstrate that SPA consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art method in both success rate (+2.5\% on average) and grounding accuracy (+1.9\% on average). Further analyses demonstrate that our method remarkably provides more effective intermediate rewards for RL training. Our code is available at https://github.com/WangHanLinHenry/SPA-RL-Agent.

      User-item interactions contain rich collaborative signals that form the backbone of many successful recommender systems. While recent work has explored the use of large language models (LLMs) for recommendation, it remains unclear whether LLMs can effectively reason over this type of collaborative information. In this paper, we conduct a systematic comparison between LLMs and classical matrix factorization (MF) models to assess LLMs' ability to leverage user-item interaction data. We further introduce a simple retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method that enhances LLMs by grounding their predictions in structured interaction data. Our experiments reveal that current LLMs often fall short in capturing collaborative patterns inherent to MF models, but that our RAG-based approach substantially improves recommendation quality-highlighting a promising direction for future LLM-based recommenders.

      The absence of explicit communication channels between automated vehicles (AVs) and other road users requires the use of external Human-Machine Interfaces (eHMIs) to convey messages effectively in uncertain scenarios. Currently, most eHMI studies employ predefined text messages and manually designed actions to perform these messages, which limits the real-world deployment of eHMIs, where adaptability in dynamic scenarios is essential. Given the generalizability and versatility of large language models (LLMs), they could potentially serve as automated action designers for the message-action design task. To validate this idea, we make three contributions: (1) We propose a pipeline that integrates LLMs and 3D renderers, using LLMs as action designers to generate executable actions for controlling eHMIs and rendering action clips. (2) We collect a user-rated Action-Design Scoring dataset comprising a total of 320 action sequences for eight intended messages and four representative eHMI modalities. The dataset validates that LLMs can translate intended messages into actions close to a human level, particularly for reasoning-enabled LLMs. (3) We introduce two automated raters, Action Reference Score (ARS) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), to benchmark 18 LLMs, finding that the VLM aligns with human preferences yet varies across eHMI modalities.

      Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a pivotal method for improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, prevalent RL approaches such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Group-Regularized Policy Optimization (GRPO) face critical limitations due to their reliance on sparse outcome-based rewards and inadequate mechanisms for incentivizing exploration. These limitations result in inefficient guidance for multi-step reasoning processes. Specifically, sparse reward signals fail to deliver effective or sufficient feedback, particularly for challenging problems. Furthermore, such reward structures induce systematic biases that prioritize exploitation of familiar trajectories over novel solution discovery. These shortcomings critically hinder performance in complex reasoning tasks, which inherently demand iterative refinement across ipntermediate steps. To address these challenges, we propose an Intrinsic Motivation guidEd exploratioN meThOd foR LLM Reasoning (i-MENTOR), a novel method designed to both deliver dense rewards and amplify explorations in the RL-based training paradigm. i-MENTOR introduces three key innovations: trajectory-aware exploration rewards that mitigate bias in token-level strategies while maintaining computational efficiency; dynamic reward scaling to stabilize exploration and exploitation in large action spaces; and advantage-preserving reward implementation that maintains advantage distribution integrity while incorporating exploratory guidance. Experiments across three public datasets demonstrate i-MENTOR's effectiveness with a 22.39% improvement on the difficult dataset Countdown-4.

      Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful tool for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to improve complex reasoning abilities. However, state-of-the-art policy optimization methods often suffer from high computational overhead and memory consumption, primarily due to the need for multiple generations per prompt and the reliance on critic networks or advantage estimates of the current policy. In this paper, we propose $A$*-PO, a novel two-stage policy optimization framework that directly approximates the optimal advantage function and enables efficient training of LLMs for reasoning tasks. In the first stage, we leverage offline sampling from a reference policy to estimate the optimal value function $V$*, eliminating the need for costly online value estimation. In the second stage, we perform on-policy updates using a simple least-squares regression loss with only a single generation per prompt. Theoretically, we establish performance guarantees and prove that the KL-regularized RL objective can be optimized without requiring complex exploration strategies. Empirically, $A$*-PO achieves competitive performance across a wide range of mathematical reasoning benchmarks, while reducing training time by up to 2$\times$ and peak memory usage by over 30% compared to PPO, GRPO, and REBEL.

      The ability to generate diverse solutions to a given problem is a hallmark of human creativity. This divergent reasoning is also crucial for machines, enhancing their robustness and enabling them to assist humans in many applications such as scientific discovery. However, existing approaches to multi-step reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have mostly focused only on reasoning accuracy, without further discovering more diverse valid solutions. For example, supervised fine-tuning improves reasoning quality but requires vast labeled data, while reward-maximizing reinforcement learning finds top-reward solutions while neglecting the solution diversity. To fill this gap, we propose Flow of Reasoning (FoR), an efficient diversity-seeking LLM finetuning method aimed at improving reasoning quality and diversity with minimal data. FoR formulates multi-step LLM reasoning as a Markovian flow on a DAG-structured reasoning graph. This formulation allows us to incorporate and adapt principled GFlowNet approaches, for finetuning LLMs to sample divergent paths with probabilities proportional to the (unnormalized) reward of target problems. Extensive experiments show that, with limited training examples (e.g., 15 examples), FoR enables the discovery of diverse, creative, high-quality solutions, greatly outperforming a wide range of existing inference and training methods across six challenging reasoning tasks, including BlocksWorld (embodied reasoning), Game24 (math puzzle solving), Rubik's Cube (spatial reasoning), 1D-ARC (abstraction reasoning), GSM8k (math reasoning), and ProntoQA (logical reasoning).

      While reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved notable success in various domains, training effective policies for complex tasks remains challenging. Agents often converge to local optima and fail to maximize long-term rewards. Existing approaches to mitigate training bottlenecks typically fall into two categories: (i) Automated policy refinement, which identifies critical states from past trajectories to guide policy updates, but suffers from costly and uncertain model training; and (ii) Human-in-the-loop refinement, where human feedback is used to correct agent behavior, but this does not scale well to environments with large or continuous action spaces. In this work, we design a large language model-guided policy modulation framework that leverages LLMs to improve RL training without additional model training or human intervention. We first prompt an LLM to identify critical states from a sub-optimal agent's trajectories. Based on these states, the LLM then provides action suggestions and assigns implicit rewards to guide policy refinement. Experiments across standard RL benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of LLM-based explanations in addressing RL training bottlenecks.

      The LLM unlearning technique has recently been introduced to comply with data regulations and address the safety and ethical concerns of LLMs by removing the undesired data-model influence. However, state-of-the-art unlearning methods face a critical vulnerability: they are susceptible to ``relearning'' the removed information from a small number of forget data points, known as relearning attacks. In this paper, we systematically investigate how to make unlearned models robust against such attacks. For the first time, we establish a connection between robust unlearning and sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) through a unified robust optimization framework, in an analogy to adversarial training designed to defend against adversarial attacks. Our analysis for SAM reveals that smoothness optimization plays a pivotal role in mitigating relearning attacks. Thus, we further explore diverse smoothing strategies to enhance unlearning robustness. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including WMDP and MUSE, demonstrate that SAM and other smoothness optimization approaches consistently improve the resistance of LLM unlearning to relearning attacks. Notably, smoothness-enhanced unlearning also helps defend against (input-level) jailbreaking attacks, broadening our proposal's impact in robustifying LLM unlearning.
