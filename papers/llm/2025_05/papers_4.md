      Improving the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical for advancing artificial intelligence. However, access to extensive, diverse, and high-quality reasoning datasets remains a significant challenge, particularly for the open-source community. In this paper, we propose ScaleQuest, a novel, scalable, and cost-effective data synthesis method that enables the generation of large-scale mathematical reasoning datasets using lightweight 7B-scale models. ScaleQuest introduces a two-stage question-tuning process comprising Question Fine-Tuning (QFT) and Question Preference Optimization (QPO) to unlock the question generation capabilities of problem-solving models. By generating diverse questions from scratch -- without relying on powerful proprietary models or seed data -- we produce a dataset of 1 million problem-solution pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that models trained on our data outperform existing open-source datasets in both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations. Furthermore, our approach shows continued performance improvement as the volume of training data increases, highlighting its potential for ongoing data scaling. The extensive improvements observed in code reasoning tasks demonstrate the generalization capabilities of our proposed method. Our work provides the open-source community with a practical solution to enhance the mathematical reasoning abilities of LLMs.

      Project building is pivotal to support various program analysis tasks, such as generating intermediate rep- resentation code for static analysis and preparing binary code for vulnerability reproduction. However, automating the building process for C/C++ projects is a highly complex endeavor, involving tremendous technical challenges, such as intricate dependency management, diverse build systems, varied toolchains, and multifaceted error handling mechanisms. Consequently, building C/C++ projects often proves to be difficult in practice, hindering the progress of downstream applications. Unfortunately, research on facilitating the building of C/C++ projects remains to be inadequate. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers promising solutions to automated software building. Trained on extensive corpora, LLMs can help unify diverse build systems through their comprehension capabilities and address complex errors by leveraging tacit knowledge storage. Moreover, LLM-based agents can be systematically designed to dynamically interact with the environment, effectively managing dynamic building issues. Motivated by these opportunities, we first conduct an empirical study to systematically analyze the current challenges in the C/C++ project building process. Particularly, we observe that most popular C/C++ projects encounter an average of five errors when relying solely on the default build systems. Based on our study, we develop an automated build system called CXXCrafter to specifically address the above-mentioned challenges, such as dependency resolution. Our evaluation on open-source software demonstrates that CXXCrafter achieves a success rate of 78% in project building. Specifically, among the Top100 dataset, 72 projects are built successfully by both CXXCrafter and manual efforts, 3 by CXXCrafter only, and 14 manually only. ...

      While fine-tuning LLMs on NLI corpora improves their inferential performance, the underlying mechanisms driving this improvement remain largely opaque. In this work, we conduct a series of experiments to investigate what LLMs actually learn during fine-tuning. We begin by analyzing predicate frequencies in premises and hypotheses across NLI datasets and identify a consistent frequency bias, where predicates in hypotheses occur more frequently than those in premises for positive instances. To assess the impact of this bias, we evaluate both standard and NLI fine-tuned LLMs on bias-consistent and bias-adversarial cases. We find that LLMs exploit frequency bias for inference and perform poorly on adversarial instances. Furthermore, fine-tuned LLMs exhibit significantly increased reliance on this bias, suggesting that they are learning these frequency patterns from datasets. Finally, we compute the frequencies of hyponyms and their corresponding hypernyms from WordNet, revealing a correlation between frequency bias and textual entailment. These findings help explain why learning frequency patterns can enhance model performance on inference tasks.

      Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a dominant AI paradigm due to their exceptional text understanding and generation capabilities. However, their tendency to generate inconsistent or erroneous outputs challenges their reliability, especially in high-stakes domains requiring accuracy and trustworthiness. Existing research primarily focuses on detecting and mitigating model misbehavior in general-purpose scenarios, often overlooking the potential of integrating domain-specific knowledge. In this work, we advance misbehavior detection by incorporating domain knowledge. The core idea is to design a general specification language that enables domain experts to customize domain-specific predicates in a lightweight and intuitive manner, supporting later runtime verification of LLM outputs. To achieve this, we design a novel specification language, ESL, and introduce a runtime verification framework, RvLLM, to validate LLM output against domain-specific constraints defined in ESL. We evaluate RvLLM on three representative tasks: violation detection against Singapore Rapid Transit Systems Act, numerical comparison, and inequality solving. Experimental results demonstrate that RvLLM effectively detects erroneous outputs across various LLMs in a lightweight and flexible manner. The results reveal that despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs remain prone to low-level errors due to limited interpretability and a lack of formal guarantees during inference, and our framework offers a potential long-term solution by leveraging expert domain knowledge to rigorously and efficiently verify LLM outputs.

      Cross-domain constituency parsing is still an unsolved challenge in computational linguistics since the available multi-domain constituency treebank is limited. We investigate automatic treebank generation by large language models (LLMs) in this paper. The performance of LLMs on constituency parsing is poor, therefore we propose a novel treebank generation method, LLM back generation, which is similar to the reverse process of constituency parsing. LLM back generation takes the incomplete cross-domain constituency tree with only domain keyword leaf nodes as input and fills the missing words to generate the cross-domain constituency treebank. Besides, we also introduce a span-level contrastive learning pre-training strategy to make full use of the LLM back generation treebank for cross-domain constituency parsing. We verify the effectiveness of our LLM back generation treebank coupled with contrastive learning pre-training on five target domains of MCTB. Experimental results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on average results compared with various baselines.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      LLMs have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks, yet they often suffer from hallucinations and lack reliable factual grounding. Meanwhile, knowledge graphs (KGs) provide structured factual knowledge but lack the flexible reasoning abilities of LLMs. In this paper, we present Reason-Align-Respond (RAR), a novel framework that systematically integrates LLM reasoning with knowledge graphs for KGQA. Our approach consists of three key components: a Reasoner that generates human-like reasoning chains, an Aligner that maps these chains to valid KG paths, and a Responser that synthesizes the final answer. We formulate this process as a probabilistic model and optimize it using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, which iteratively refines the reasoning chains and knowledge paths. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of RAR, achieving state-of-the-art performance with Hit@1 scores of 93.3% and 91.0% on WebQSP and CWQ respectively. Human evaluation confirms that RAR generates high-quality, interpretable reasoning chains well-aligned with KG paths. Furthermore, RAR exhibits strong zero-shot generalization capabilities and maintains computational efficiency during inference.

      Response consistency-based, reference-free hallucination detection (RFHD) methods do not depend on internal model states, such as generation probabilities or gradients, which Grey-box models typically rely on but are inaccessible in closed-source LLMs. However, their inability to capture query-response alignment patterns often results in lower detection accuracy. Additionally, the lack of large-scale benchmark datasets spanning diverse domains remains a challenge, as most existing datasets are limited in size and scope. To this end, we propose HalluCounter, a novel reference-free hallucination detection method that utilizes both response-response and query-response consistency and alignment patterns. This enables the training of a classifier that detects hallucinations and provides a confidence score and an optimal response for user queries. Furthermore, we introduce HalluCounterEval, a benchmark dataset comprising both synthetically generated and human-curated samples across multiple domains. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by a significant margin, achieving over 90\% average confidence in hallucination detection across datasets.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Positional bias in large language models (LLMs) hinders their ability to effectively process long inputs. A prominent example is the "lost in the middle" phenomenon, where LLMs struggle to utilize relevant information situated in the middle of the input. While prior research primarily focuses on single pieces of relevant information, real-world applications often involve multiple relevant information pieces. To bridge this gap, we present LongPiBench, a benchmark designed to assess positional bias involving multiple pieces of relevant information. Thorough experiments are conducted with five commercial and six open-source models. These experiments reveal that while most current models are robust against the "lost in the middle" issue, there exist significant biases related to the spacing of relevant information pieces. These findings highlight the importance of evaluating and reducing positional biases to advance LLM's capabilities.

      LLM providers typically offer multiple LLM tiers, varying in performance and price. As NLP tasks become more complex and modularized, selecting the suitable LLM tier for each subtask is a key challenge to balance between cost and performance. To address the problem, we introduce LLM Automatic Transmission (LLM-AT) framework that automatically selects LLM tiers without training. LLM-AT consists of Starter, Generator, and Judge. The starter selects the initial LLM tier expected to solve the given question, the generator produces a response using the LLM of the selected tier, and the judge evaluates the validity of the response. If the response is invalid, LLM-AT iteratively upgrades to a higher-tier model, generates a new response, and re-evaluates until a valid response is obtained. Additionally, we propose accuracy estimator, which enables the suitable initial LLM tier selection without training. Given an input question, accuracy estimator estimates the expected accuracy of each LLM tier by computing the valid response rate across top-k similar queries from past inference records. Experiments demonstrate that LLM-AT achieves superior performance while reducing costs, making it a practical solution for real-world applications.

      Large language models (LLMs) provide powerful means to leverage prior knowledge for predictive modeling when data is limited. In this work, we demonstrate how LLMs can use their compressed world knowledge to generate intrinsically interpretable machine learning models, i.e., decision trees, without any training data. We find that these zero-shot decision trees can even surpass data-driven trees on some small-sized tabular datasets and that embeddings derived from these trees perform better than data-driven tree-based embeddings on average. Our decision tree induction and embedding approaches can therefore serve as new knowledge-driven baselines for data-driven machine learning methods in the low-data regime. Furthermore, they offer ways to harness the rich world knowledge within LLMs for tabular machine learning tasks. Our code and results are available at https://github.com/ml-lab-htw/llm-trees.

      Fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) often demonstrate poor calibration, with their confidence scores misaligned with actual performance. While calibration has been extensively studied in models trained from scratch, the impact of LLMs' prior knowledge on calibration during fine-tuning remains understudied. Our research reveals that LLMs' prior knowledge causes potential poor calibration due to the ubiquitous presence of known data in real-world fine-tuning, which appears harmful for calibration. Specifically, data aligned with LLMs' prior knowledge would induce overconfidence, while new knowledge improves calibration. Our findings expose a tension: LLMs' encyclopedic knowledge, while enabling task versatility, undermines calibration through unavoidable knowledge overlaps. To address this, we propose CogCalib, a cognition-aware framework that applies targeted learning strategies according to the model's prior knowledge. Experiments across 7 tasks using 3 LLM families prove that CogCalib significantly improves calibration while maintaining performance, achieving an average 57\% reduction in ECE compared to standard fine-tuning in Llama3-8B. These improvements generalize well to out-of-domain tasks, enhancing the objectivity and reliability of domain-specific LLMs, and making them more trustworthy for critical human-AI interaction applications.

      Quantizing large language models (LLMs) to 1-bit precision significantly reduces computational costs, but existing quantization techniques suffer from noticeable performance degradation when using weight and activation precisions below 4 bits (W4A4). In this paper, we propose a post-training quantization framework with W(1+1)A(1*4) configuration, where weights are quantized to 1 bit with an additional 1 bit for fine-grain grouping and activations are quantized to 1 bit with a 4-fold increase in the number of channels. For weight quantization, we propose utilizing Hessian-aware fine-grained grouping along with an EM-based quantization scheme. For activation quantization, we decompose INT4-quantized activations into a 4 * INT1 format equivalently and simultaneously smooth the scaling factors based on quantization errors, which further reduces the quantization errors in activations. Our method surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLM quantization baselines on W2A4 across multiple tasks, pushing the boundaries of existing LLM quantization methods toward fully binarized models.

      Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has proven effective in improving the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) during inference. However, existing research has overlooked the efficiency of TTS from a latency-sensitive perspective. Through a latency-aware evaluation of representative TTS methods, we demonstrate that a compute-optimal TTS does not always result in the lowest latency in scenarios where latency is critical. To address this gap and achieve latency-optimal TTS, we propose two key approaches by optimizing the concurrency configurations: (1) branch-wise parallelism, which leverages multiple concurrent inference branches, and (2) sequence-wise parallelism, enabled by speculative decoding. By integrating these two approaches and allocating computational resources properly to each, our latency-optimal TTS enables a 32B model to reach 82.3% accuracy on MATH-500 within 1 minute and a smaller 3B model to achieve 72.4% within 10 seconds. Our work emphasizes the importance of latency-aware TTS and demonstrates its ability to deliver both speed and accuracy in latency-sensitive scenarios.

      Maintaining consistent model performance across domains is a fundamental challenge in machine learning. While recent work has explored using LLM-generated data for fine-tuning, its impact on cross-domain generalization remains poorly understood. This paper presents a systematic analysis revealing that fine-tuning with LLM-generated data not only improves target task performance but also reduces non-target task degradation compared to fine-tuning with ground truth data. Through analyzing the data sequence in tasks of various domains, we demonstrate that this enhancement of non-target task robustness stems from the reduction of high perplexity tokens found in LLM-generated sequences. Following our findings, we showed that masking high perplexity tokens in ground truth training data achieves similar non-target task performance preservation, comparable to using LLM-generated data. Extensive experiments across different model families and scales, including Gemma 2 IT 2B, Llama 3 8B Instruct, and 3 additional models, agree with our findings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide an empirical explanation based on token perplexity reduction to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in LLMs after fine-tuning, offering valuable insights for developing more robust fine-tuning strategies.

      The widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) has increased the importance of demand response in smart grids. This paper proposes a two-layer demand response optimization framework for EV users and aggregators, leveraging large language models (LLMs) to balance electricity supply and demand and optimize energy utilization during EV charging. The upper-layer model, focusing on the aggregator, aims to maximize profits by adjusting retail electricity prices. The lower-layer model targets EV users, using LLMs to simulate charging demands under varying electricity prices and optimize both costs and user comfort. The study employs a multi-threaded LLM decision generator to dynamically analyze user behavior, charging preferences, and psychological factors. The framework utilizes the PSO method to optimize electricity prices, ensuring user needs are met while increasing aggregator profits. Simulation results show that the proposed model improves EV charging efficiency, alleviates peak power loads, and stabilizes smart grid operations.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are predominantly evaluated on Standard American English (SAE), often overlooking the diversity of global English varieties. This narrow focus may raise fairness concerns as degraded performance on non-standard varieties can lead to unequal benefits for users worldwide. Therefore, it is critical to extensively evaluate the linguistic robustness of LLMs on multiple non-standard English varieties. We introduce Trans-EnV, a framework that automatically transforms SAE datasets into multiple English varieties to evaluate the linguistic robustness. Our framework combines (1) linguistics expert knowledge to curate variety-specific features and transformation guidelines from linguistic literature and corpora, and (2) LLM-based transformations to ensure both linguistic validity and scalability. Using Trans-EnV, we transform six benchmark datasets into 38 English varieties and evaluate seven state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results reveal significant performance disparities, with accuracy decreasing by up to 46.3% on non-standard varieties. These findings highlight the importance of comprehensive linguistic robustness evaluation across diverse English varieties.

      Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in tasks such as code and mathematics. However, their potential to internalize structured spatial knowledge remains underexplored. This study investigates whether LLMs, grounded in locally relative human observations, can construct coherent global spatial cognition by integrating fragmented relational descriptions. We focus on two core aspects of spatial cognition: spatial perception, where models infer consistent global layouts from local positional relationships, and spatial navigation, where models learn road connectivity from trajectory data and plan optimal paths between unconnected locations. Experiments conducted in a simulated urban environment demonstrate that LLMs not only generalize to unseen spatial relationships between points of interest (POIs) but also exhibit latent representations aligned with real-world spatial distributions. Furthermore, LLMs can learn road connectivity from trajectory descriptions, enabling accurate path planning and dynamic spatial awareness during navigation.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated formidable capabilities in solving mathematical problems, yet they may still commit logical reasoning and computational errors during the problem-solving process. Thus, this paper proposes a framework, MATH-VF, which includes a Formalizer and a Critic, for formally verifying the correctness of the solutions generated by large language models. Our framework first utilizes a Formalizer which employs an LLM to translate a natural language solution into a formal context. Afterward, our Critic (which integrates various external tools such as a Computer Algebra System and an SMT solver) evaluates the correctness of each statement within the formal context, and when a statement is incorrect, our Critic provides corrective feedback. We empirically investigate the effectiveness of MATH-VF in two scenarios: 1) Verification: MATH-VF is utilized to determine the correctness of a solution to a given problem. 2) Refinement: When MATH-VF identifies errors in the solution generated by an LLM-based solution generator for a given problem, it submits the corrective suggestions proposed by the Critic to the solution generator to regenerate the solution. We evaluate our framework on widely used mathematical benchmarks: MATH500 and ProcessBench, demonstrating the superiority of our approach over existing approaches.

      Encrypted traffic classification is highly challenging in network security due to the need for extracting robust features from content-agnostic traffic data. Existing approaches face critical issues: (i) Distribution drift, caused by reliance on the closedworld assumption, limits adaptability to realworld, shifting patterns; (ii) Dependence on labeled data restricts applicability where such data is scarce or unavailable. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in offering generalizable solutions across a wide range of tasks, achieving notable success in various specialized fields. However, their effectiveness in traffic analysis remains constrained by challenges in adapting to the unique requirements of the traffic domain. In this paper, we introduce a novel traffic representation model named Encrypted Traffic Out-of-Distribution Instruction Tuning with LLM (ETooL), which integrates LLMs with knowledge of traffic structures through a self-supervised instruction tuning paradigm. This framework establishes connections between textual information and traffic interactions. ETooL demonstrates more robust classification performance and superior generalization in both supervised and zero-shot traffic classification tasks. Notably, it achieves significant improvements in F1 scores: APP53 (I.I.D.) to 93.19%(6.62%) and 92.11%(4.19%), APP53 (O.O.D.) to 74.88%(18.17%) and 72.13%(15.15%), and ISCX-Botnet (O.O.D.) to 95.03%(9.16%) and 81.95%(12.08%). Additionally, we construct NETD, a traffic dataset designed to support dynamic distributional shifts, and use it to validate ETooL's effectiveness under varying distributional conditions. Furthermore, we evaluate the efficiency gains achieved through ETooL's instruction tuning approach.

      Despite remarkable advances in the field, LLMs remain unreliable in distinguishing causation from correlation. Recent results from the Corr2Cause dataset benchmark reveal that state-of-the-art LLMs -- such as GPT-4 (F1 score: 29.08) -- only marginally outperform random baselines (Random Uniform, F1 score: 20.38), indicating limited capacity of generalization. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel structured approach: rather than directly answering causal queries, we provide the model with the capability to structure its thinking by guiding the model to build a structured knowledge graph, systematically encoding the provided correlational premises, to answer the causal queries. This intermediate representation significantly enhances the model's causal capabilities. Experiments on the test subset of the Corr2Cause dataset benchmark with Qwen3-32B model (reasoning model) show substantial gains over standard direct prompting methods, improving F1 scores from 32.71 to 48.26 (over 47.5% relative increase), along with notable improvements in precision and recall. These results underscore the effectiveness of providing the model with the capability to structure its thinking and highlight its promising potential for broader generalization across diverse causal inference tasks.

      Machine unlearning aims to selectively remove targeted knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs), ensuring they forget specified content while retaining essential information. Existing unlearning metrics assess whether a model correctly answers retain queries and rejects forget queries, but they fail to capture real-world scenarios where forget queries rarely appear in isolation. In fact, forget and retain queries often coexist within the same prompt, making mixed-query evaluation crucial. We introduce SEPS, an evaluation framework that explicitly measures a model's ability to both forget and retain information within a single prompt. Through extensive experiments across three benchmarks, we identify two key failure modes in existing unlearning methods: (1) untargeted unlearning indiscriminately erases both forget and retain content once a forget query appears, and (2) targeted unlearning overfits to single-query scenarios, leading to catastrophic failures when handling multiple queries. To address these issues, we propose Mixed Prompt (MP) unlearning, a strategy that integrates both forget and retain queries into a unified training objective. Our approach significantly improves unlearning effectiveness, demonstrating robustness even in complex settings with up to eight mixed forget and retain queries in a single prompt.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) and other automated techniques have been increasingly used to support software developers by generating software artifacts such as code snippets, patches, and comments. However, accurately assessing the correctness of these generated artifacts remains a significant challenge. On one hand, human evaluation provides high accuracy but is labor-intensive and lacks scalability. On the other hand, other existing automatic evaluation metrics are scalable and require minimal human effort, but they often fail to accurately reflect the actual correctness of generated software artifacts. In this paper, we present SWE-Judge, the first evaluation metric for LLM-as-Ensemble-Judge specifically designed to accurately assess the correctness of generated software artifacts. SWE-Judge first defines five distinct evaluation strategies, each implemented as an independent judge. A dynamic team selection mechanism then identifies the most appropriate subset of judges to produce a final correctness score through ensembling. We evaluate SWE-Judge across a diverse set of software engineering (SE) benchmarks, including CoNaLa, Card2Code, HumanEval-X, APPS, APR-Assess, and Summary-Assess. These benchmarks span three SE tasks: code generation, automated program repair, and code summarization. Experimental results demonstrate that SWE-Judge consistently achieves a higher correlation with human judgments, with improvements ranging from 5.9% to 183.8% over existing automatic metrics. Furthermore, SWE-Judge reaches agreement levels with human annotators that are comparable to inter-annotator agreement in code generation and program repair tasks. These findings underscore SWE-Judge's potential as a scalable and reliable alternative to human evaluation.

      Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) often requires costly human annotations. To address this, LLM-based judges have been proposed, which compare the outputs of two LLMs enabling the ranking of models without human intervention. While several approaches have been proposed, many confounding factors are present between different papers. For instance the model, the prompt and other hyperparameters are typically changed at the same time making apple-to-apple comparisons challenging. In this paper, we propose to systematically analyze and tune the hyperparameters of LLM judges. To alleviate the high cost of evaluating a judge, we propose to leverage multi-objective multi-fidelity which allows to find judges that trade accuracy for cost and also significantly reduce the cost of the search. Our method identifies judges that not only outperform existing benchmarks in accuracy and cost-efficiency but also utilize open-weight models, ensuring greater accessibility and reproducibility.

      As large language models become increasingly prevalent, memory bandwidth constraints significantly limit inference throughput, motivating post-training quantization (PTQ). In this paper, we propose FireQ, a co-designed PTQ framework and an INT4-FP8 matrix multiplication kernel that accelerates LLM inference across all linear layers. Specifically, FireQ quantizes linear layer weights and key-values to INT4, and activations and queries to FP8, significantly enhancing throughput. Additionally, we introduce a three-stage pipelining for the prefill phase, which modifies the FlashAttention-3 kernel, effectively reducing time-to-first-token in the prefill phase. To minimize accuracy loss from quantization, we develop novel outlier smoothing techniques tailored separately for linear and attention layers. In linear layers, we explicitly use per-tensor scaling to prevent underflow caused by the FP8 quantization scaling factor of INT4 quantization, and channel-wise scaling to compensate for coarse granularity of INT4. In attention layers, we address quantization challenges posed by rotary positional embeddings (RoPE) by combining pre-RoPE and post-RoPE scaling strategies. FireQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 1.68x faster inference in feed-forward network layers on Llama2-7B and 1.26x faster prefill phase performance on Llama3-8B compared to QServe, with negligible accuracy loss.

      Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to tackle complex tasks, driven by their expanding applications and users' growing proficiency in crafting sophisticated prompts. However, as the number of explicitly stated requirements increases (particularly more than 10 constraints), LLMs often struggle to accurately follow such complex instructions. To address this challenge, we propose RECAST, a novel framework for synthesizing datasets where each example incorporates far more constraints than those in existing benchmarks. These constraints are extracted from real-world prompt-response pairs to ensure practical relevance. RECAST enables automatic verification of constraint satisfaction via rule-based validators for quantitative constraints and LLM-based validators for qualitative ones. Using this framework, we construct RECAST-30K, a large-scale, high-quality dataset comprising 30k instances spanning 15 constraint types. Experimental results demonstrate that models fine-tuned on RECAST-30K show substantial improvements in following complex instructions. Moreover, the verifiability provided by RECAST enables the design of reward functions for reinforcement learning, which further boosts model performance on complex and challenging tasks.

In this paper we introduce MedSentry, a benchmark comprising 5 000 adversarial medical prompts spanning 25 threat categories with 100 subthemes. Coupled with this dataset, we develop an end-to-end attack-defense evaluation pipeline to systematically analyze how four representative multi-agent topologies (Layers, SharedPool, Centralized, and Decentralized) withstand attacks from 'dark-personality' agents. Our findings reveal critical differences in how these architectures handle information contamination and maintain robust decision-making, exposing their underlying vulnerability mechanisms. For instance, SharedPool's open information sharing makes it highly susceptible, whereas Decentralized architectures exhibit greater resilience thanks to inherent redundancy and isolation. To mitigate these risks, we propose a personality-scale detection and correction mechanism that identifies and rehabilitates malicious agents, restoring system safety to near-baseline levels. MedSentry thus furnishes both a rigorous evaluation framework and practical defense strategies that guide the design of safer LLM-based multi-agent systems in medical domains.

      Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to revolutionize smart home assistants by enhancing their ability to accurately understand user needs and respond appropriately, which is extremely beneficial for building a smarter home environment. While recent studies have explored integrating LLMs into smart home systems, they primarily focus on handling straightforward, valid single-device operation instructions. However, real-world scenarios are far more complex and often involve users issuing invalid instructions or controlling multiple devices simultaneously. These have two main challenges: LLMs must accurately identify and rectify errors in user instructions and execute multiple user instructions perfectly. To address these challenges and advance the development of LLM-based smart home assistants, we introduce HomeBench, the first smart home dataset with valid and invalid instructions across single and multiple devices in this paper. We have experimental results on 13 distinct LLMs; e.g., GPT-4o achieves only a 0.0% success rate in the scenario of invalid multi-device instructions, revealing that the existing state-of-the-art LLMs still cannot perform well in this situation even with the help of in-context learning, retrieval-augmented generation, and fine-tuning.

To overcome this, we propose SENSE, a novel prompting approach that embeds semantic hints within the prompt. Experiments show that SENSE consistently improves LLMs' performance across various tasks, highlighting the potential of integrating semantic information to improve LLM capabilities.

      Large language models (LLMs) excel at mathematical reasoning and logical problem-solving. The current popular training paradigms primarily use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the models' reasoning abilities. However, when using SFT or RL alone, there are respective challenges: SFT may suffer from overfitting, while RL is prone to mode collapse. The state-of-the-art methods have proposed hybrid training schemes. However, static switching faces challenges such as poor generalization across different tasks and high dependence on data quality. In response to these challenges, inspired by the curriculum learning-quiz mechanism in human reasoning cultivation, We propose SASR, a step-wise adaptive hybrid training framework that theoretically unifies SFT and RL and dynamically balances the two throughout optimization. SASR uses SFT for initial warm-up to establish basic reasoning skills, and then uses an adaptive dynamic adjustment algorithm based on gradient norm and divergence relative to the original distribution to seamlessly integrate SFT with the online RL method GRPO. By monitoring the training status of LLMs and adjusting the training process in sequence, SASR ensures a smooth transition between training schemes, maintaining core reasoning abilities while exploring different paths. Experimental results demonstrate that SASR outperforms SFT, RL, and static hybrid training methods.

      Recent years have witnessed extensive exploration of Large Language Models (LLMs) on the field of Recommender Systems (RS). There are currently two commonly used strategies to enable LLMs to have recommendation capabilities: 1) The "Guidance-Only" strategy uses in-context learning to exploit and amplify the inherent semantic understanding and item recommendation capabilities of LLMs; 2) The "Tuning-Only" strategy uses supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to fine-tune LLMs with the aim of fitting them to real recommendation data. However, neither of these strategies can effectively bridge the gap between the knowledge space of LLMs and recommendation, and their performance do not meet our expectations. To better enable LLMs to learn recommendation knowledge, we combine the advantages of the above two strategies and proposed a novel "Guidance+Tuning" method called Self-Optimized Fine-Tuning (SOFT), which adopts the idea of curriculum learning. It first employs self-distillation to construct an auxiliary easy-to-learn but meaningful dataset from a fine-tuned LLM. Then it further utilizes a self-adaptive curriculum scheduler to enable LLMs to gradually learn from simpler data (self-distilled data) to more challenging data (real RS data). Extensive experiments demonstrate that SOFT significantly enhances the recommendation accuracy (37.59\% on average) of LLM-based methods.

We first examine classical and modern RL algorithms -- spanning policy gradients, actor-critic methods, human-feedback alignment, and preference-based optimization -- and their adaptations to the unique challenges of code generation, such as sparse and delayed rewards. Next, we analyze key benchmarks, datasets, and evaluation metrics that drive progress in RL-augmented Code LLMs. Finally, we identify open problems, including the need for richer feedback sources, support for low-level and domain-specific languages, and methods to reduce computational overhead.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve superior performance through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, but these token-level reasoning chains are computationally expensive and inefficient. In this paper, we introduce Compressed Latent Reasoning (CoLaR), a novel framework that dynamically compresses reasoning processes in latent space through a two-stage training approach. First, during supervised fine-tuning, CoLaR extends beyond next-token prediction by incorporating an auxiliary next compressed embedding prediction objective. This process merges embeddings of consecutive tokens using a compression factor randomly sampled from a predefined range, and trains a specialized latent head to predict distributions of subsequent compressed embeddings. Second, we enhance CoLaR through reinforcement learning (RL) that leverages the latent head's non-deterministic nature to explore diverse reasoning paths and exploit more compact ones. This approach enables CoLaR to: i) perform reasoning at a dense latent level (i.e., silently), substantially reducing reasoning chain length, and ii) dynamically adjust reasoning speed at inference time by simply prompting the desired compression factor. Extensive experiments across four mathematical reasoning datasets demonstrate that CoLaR achieves 14.1% higher accuracy than latent-based baseline methods at comparable compression ratios, and reduces reasoning chain length by 53.3% with only 4.8% performance degradation compared to explicit CoT method. Moreover, when applied to more challenging mathematical reasoning tasks, our RL-enhanced CoLaR demonstrates performance gains of up to 5.4% while dramatically reducing latent reasoning chain length by 82.8%. The code and models will be released upon acceptance.

      Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited extraordinary performance in a variety of tasks while it remains challenging for them to solve complex multi-step tasks as agents. In practice, agents sensitive to the outcome of certain key steps which makes them likely to fail the task because of a subtle mistake in the planning trajectory. Recent approaches resort to calibrating the reasoning process through reinforcement learning. They reward or penalize every reasoning step with process supervision, as known as Process Reward Models (PRMs). However, PRMs are difficult and costly to scale up with a large number of next action candidates since they require extensive computations to acquire the training data through the per-step trajectory exploration. To mitigate this issue, we focus on the relative reward trend across successive reasoning steps and propose maintaining an increasing reward in the collected trajectories for process supervision, which we term Reward Rising Optimization (RRO). Specifically, we incrementally augment the process supervision until identifying a step exhibiting positive reward differentials, i.e. rising rewards, relative to its preceding iteration. This method dynamically expands the search space for the next action candidates, efficiently capturing high-quality data. We provide mathematical groundings and empirical results on the WebShop and InterCode-SQL benchmarks, showing that our proposed RRO achieves superior performance while requiring much less exploration cost.

      Reinforcement learning (RL) holds significant promise for training LLM agents to handle complex, goal-oriented tasks that require multi-step interactions with external environments. However, a critical challenge when applying RL to these agentic tasks arises from delayed rewards: feedback signals are typically available only after the entire task is completed. This makes it non-trivial to assign delayed rewards to earlier actions, providing insufficient guidance regarding environmental constraints and hindering agent training. In this work, we draw on the insight that the ultimate completion of a task emerges from the cumulative progress an agent makes across individual steps. We propose Stepwise Progress Attribution (SPA), a general reward redistribution framework that decomposes the final reward into stepwise contributions, each reflecting its incremental progress toward overall task completion. To achieve this, we train a progress estimator that accumulates stepwise contributions over a trajectory to match the task completion. During policy optimization, we combine the estimated per-step contribution with a grounding signal for actions executed in the environment as the fine-grained, intermediate reward for effective agent training. Extensive experiments on common agent benchmarks (including Webshop, ALFWorld, and VirtualHome) demonstrate that SPA consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art method in both success rate (+2.5\% on average) and grounding accuracy (+1.9\% on average). Further analyses demonstrate that our method remarkably provides more effective intermediate rewards for RL training. Our code is available at https://github.com/WangHanLinHenry/SPA-RL-Agent.

      User-item interactions contain rich collaborative signals that form the backbone of many successful recommender systems. While recent work has explored the use of large language models (LLMs) for recommendation, it remains unclear whether LLMs can effectively reason over this type of collaborative information. In this paper, we conduct a systematic comparison between LLMs and classical matrix factorization (MF) models to assess LLMs' ability to leverage user-item interaction data. We further introduce a simple retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method that enhances LLMs by grounding their predictions in structured interaction data. Our experiments reveal that current LLMs often fall short in capturing collaborative patterns inherent to MF models, but that our RAG-based approach substantially improves recommendation quality-highlighting a promising direction for future LLM-based recommenders.

      The absence of explicit communication channels between automated vehicles (AVs) and other road users requires the use of external Human-Machine Interfaces (eHMIs) to convey messages effectively in uncertain scenarios. Currently, most eHMI studies employ predefined text messages and manually designed actions to perform these messages, which limits the real-world deployment of eHMIs, where adaptability in dynamic scenarios is essential. Given the generalizability and versatility of large language models (LLMs), they could potentially serve as automated action designers for the message-action design task. To validate this idea, we make three contributions: (1) We propose a pipeline that integrates LLMs and 3D renderers, using LLMs as action designers to generate executable actions for controlling eHMIs and rendering action clips. (2) We collect a user-rated Action-Design Scoring dataset comprising a total of 320 action sequences for eight intended messages and four representative eHMI modalities. The dataset validates that LLMs can translate intended messages into actions close to a human level, particularly for reasoning-enabled LLMs. (3) We introduce two automated raters, Action Reference Score (ARS) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), to benchmark 18 LLMs, finding that the VLM aligns with human preferences yet varies across eHMI modalities.

      Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a pivotal method for improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, prevalent RL approaches such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Group-Regularized Policy Optimization (GRPO) face critical limitations due to their reliance on sparse outcome-based rewards and inadequate mechanisms for incentivizing exploration. These limitations result in inefficient guidance for multi-step reasoning processes. Specifically, sparse reward signals fail to deliver effective or sufficient feedback, particularly for challenging problems. Furthermore, such reward structures induce systematic biases that prioritize exploitation of familiar trajectories over novel solution discovery. These shortcomings critically hinder performance in complex reasoning tasks, which inherently demand iterative refinement across ipntermediate steps. To address these challenges, we propose an Intrinsic Motivation guidEd exploratioN meThOd foR LLM Reasoning (i-MENTOR), a novel method designed to both deliver dense rewards and amplify explorations in the RL-based training paradigm. i-MENTOR introduces three key innovations: trajectory-aware exploration rewards that mitigate bias in token-level strategies while maintaining computational efficiency; dynamic reward scaling to stabilize exploration and exploitation in large action spaces; and advantage-preserving reward implementation that maintains advantage distribution integrity while incorporating exploratory guidance. Experiments across three public datasets demonstrate i-MENTOR's effectiveness with a 22.39% improvement on the difficult dataset Countdown-4.

      Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful tool for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to improve complex reasoning abilities. However, state-of-the-art policy optimization methods often suffer from high computational overhead and memory consumption, primarily due to the need for multiple generations per prompt and the reliance on critic networks or advantage estimates of the current policy. In this paper, we propose $A$*-PO, a novel two-stage policy optimization framework that directly approximates the optimal advantage function and enables efficient training of LLMs for reasoning tasks. In the first stage, we leverage offline sampling from a reference policy to estimate the optimal value function $V$*, eliminating the need for costly online value estimation. In the second stage, we perform on-policy updates using a simple least-squares regression loss with only a single generation per prompt. Theoretically, we establish performance guarantees and prove that the KL-regularized RL objective can be optimized without requiring complex exploration strategies. Empirically, $A$*-PO achieves competitive performance across a wide range of mathematical reasoning benchmarks, while reducing training time by up to 2$\times$ and peak memory usage by over 30% compared to PPO, GRPO, and REBEL.

      The ability to generate diverse solutions to a given problem is a hallmark of human creativity. This divergent reasoning is also crucial for machines, enhancing their robustness and enabling them to assist humans in many applications such as scientific discovery. However, existing approaches to multi-step reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have mostly focused only on reasoning accuracy, without further discovering more diverse valid solutions. For example, supervised fine-tuning improves reasoning quality but requires vast labeled data, while reward-maximizing reinforcement learning finds top-reward solutions while neglecting the solution diversity. To fill this gap, we propose Flow of Reasoning (FoR), an efficient diversity-seeking LLM finetuning method aimed at improving reasoning quality and diversity with minimal data. FoR formulates multi-step LLM reasoning as a Markovian flow on a DAG-structured reasoning graph. This formulation allows us to incorporate and adapt principled GFlowNet approaches, for finetuning LLMs to sample divergent paths with probabilities proportional to the (unnormalized) reward of target problems. Extensive experiments show that, with limited training examples (e.g., 15 examples), FoR enables the discovery of diverse, creative, high-quality solutions, greatly outperforming a wide range of existing inference and training methods across six challenging reasoning tasks, including BlocksWorld (embodied reasoning), Game24 (math puzzle solving), Rubik's Cube (spatial reasoning), 1D-ARC (abstraction reasoning), GSM8k (math reasoning), and ProntoQA (logical reasoning).

      While reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved notable success in various domains, training effective policies for complex tasks remains challenging. Agents often converge to local optima and fail to maximize long-term rewards. Existing approaches to mitigate training bottlenecks typically fall into two categories: (i) Automated policy refinement, which identifies critical states from past trajectories to guide policy updates, but suffers from costly and uncertain model training; and (ii) Human-in-the-loop refinement, where human feedback is used to correct agent behavior, but this does not scale well to environments with large or continuous action spaces. In this work, we design a large language model-guided policy modulation framework that leverages LLMs to improve RL training without additional model training or human intervention. We first prompt an LLM to identify critical states from a sub-optimal agent's trajectories. Based on these states, the LLM then provides action suggestions and assigns implicit rewards to guide policy refinement. Experiments across standard RL benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of LLM-based explanations in addressing RL training bottlenecks.

      The LLM unlearning technique has recently been introduced to comply with data regulations and address the safety and ethical concerns of LLMs by removing the undesired data-model influence. However, state-of-the-art unlearning methods face a critical vulnerability: they are susceptible to ``relearning'' the removed information from a small number of forget data points, known as relearning attacks. In this paper, we systematically investigate how to make unlearned models robust against such attacks. For the first time, we establish a connection between robust unlearning and sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) through a unified robust optimization framework, in an analogy to adversarial training designed to defend against adversarial attacks. Our analysis for SAM reveals that smoothness optimization plays a pivotal role in mitigating relearning attacks. Thus, we further explore diverse smoothing strategies to enhance unlearning robustness. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including WMDP and MUSE, demonstrate that SAM and other smoothness optimization approaches consistently improve the resistance of LLM unlearning to relearning attacks. Notably, smoothness-enhanced unlearning also helps defend against (input-level) jailbreaking attacks, broadening our proposal's impact in robustifying LLM unlearning.

      Recent research on Reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sought to further enhance their performance by integrating meta-thinking -- enabling models to monitor, evaluate, and control their reasoning processes for more adaptive and effective problem-solving. However, current single-agent work lacks a specialized design for acquiring meta-thinking, resulting in low efficacy. To address this challenge, we introduce Reinforced Meta-thinking Agents (ReMA), a novel framework that leverages Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to elicit meta-thinking behaviors, encouraging LLMs to think about thinking. ReMA decouples the reasoning process into two hierarchical agents: a high-level meta-thinking agent responsible for generating strategic oversight and plans, and a low-level reasoning agent for detailed executions. Through iterative reinforcement learning with aligned objectives, these agents explore and learn collaboration, leading to improved generalization and robustness. Empirical results from single-turn experiments demonstrate that ReMA outperforms single-agent RL baselines on complex reasoning tasks, including competitive-level mathematical benchmarks and LLM-as-a-Judge benchmarks. Additionally, we further extend ReMA to multi-turn interaction settings, leveraging turn-level ratio and parameter sharing to improve efficiency. Comprehensive ablation studies further illustrate the evolving dynamics of each distinct agent, providing valuable insights into how the meta-thinking reasoning process enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Our code can be found in https://github.com/ziyuwan/ReMA-public

      Efficient KV cache management in LLMs is crucial for long-context tasks like RAG and summarization. Existing KV cache compression methods enforce a fixed pattern, neglecting task-specific characteristics and reducing the retention of essential information. However, we observe distinct activation patterns across layers in various tasks, highlighting the need for adaptive strategies tailored to each task's unique demands. Based on this insight, we propose DynamicKV, a method that dynamically optimizes token retention by adjusting the number of tokens retained at each layer to adapt to the specific task. DynamicKV establishes global and per-layer maximum KV cache budgets, temporarily retaining the maximum budget for the current layer, and periodically updating the KV cache sizes of all preceding layers during inference. Our method retains only 1.7% of the KV cache size while achieving ~85% of the Full KV cache performance on LongBench. Notably, even under extreme compression (0.9%), DynamicKV surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 11% in the Needle-in-a-Haystack test using Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2. The code will be released.

      Temporal Logic (TL), especially Signal Temporal Logic (STL), enables precise formal specification, making it widely used in cyber-physical systems such as autonomous driving and robotics. Automatically transforming NL into STL is an attractive approach to overcome the limitations of manual transformation, which is time-consuming and error-prone. However, due to the lack of datasets, automatic transformation currently faces significant challenges and has not been fully explored. In this paper, we propose an NL-STL dataset named STL-Diversity-Enhanced (STL-DivEn), which comprises 16,000 samples enriched with diverse patterns. To develop the dataset, we first manually create a small-scale seed set of NL-STL pairs. Next, representative examples are identified through clustering and used to guide large language models (LLMs) in generating additional NL-STL pairs. Finally, diversity and accuracy are ensured through rigorous rule-based filters and human validation. Furthermore, we introduce the Knowledge-Guided STL Transformation (KGST) framework, a novel approach for transforming natural language into STL, involving a generate-then-refine process based on external knowledge. Statistical analysis shows that the STL-DivEn dataset exhibits more diversity than the existing NL-STL dataset. Moreover, both metric-based and human evaluations indicate that our KGST approach outperforms baseline models in transformation accuracy on STL-DivEn and DeepSTL datasets.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to deconstruct complex problems. While longer CoTs are often presumed superior, this paper challenges that notion, arguing that longer is not always better. Drawing on combined evidence from real-world observations, controlled experiments, and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that task accuracy typically follows an inverted U-shaped curve with CoT length, where performance initially improves but eventually decreases as the number of CoT steps increases. With controlled experiments, we further uncover the scaling behaviors of the optimal CoT length: it increases with task difficulty but decreases with model capability, exposing an inherent simplicity bias where more capable models favor shorter, more efficient CoT reasoning. This bias is also evident in Reinforcement Learning (RL) training, where models gravitate towards shorter CoTs as their accuracy improves. To have a deep understanding of these dynamics, we establish a simple theoretical model that formally proves these phenomena, including the optimal length's scaling laws and the emergence of simplicity bias during RL. Guided by this framework, we demonstrate significant practical benefits from training with optimally-lengthed CoTs and employing length-aware filtering at inference. These findings offer both a principled understanding of the "overthinking" phenomenon and multiple practical guidelines for CoT calibration, enabling LLMs to achieve optimal reasoning performance with adaptive CoTs tailored to task complexity and model capability.

Unlike prior benchmarks that oversimplify XBRL tagging as flat multi-class classification and focus solely on narrative text, FinTagging decomposes the XBRL tagging problem into two subtasks: FinNI for financial entity extraction and FinCL for taxonomy-driven concept alignment. It requires models to jointly extract facts and align them with the full 10k+ US-GAAP taxonomy across both unstructured text and structured tables, enabling realistic, fine-grained evaluation. We assess a diverse set of LLMs under zero-shot settings, systematically analyzing their performance on both subtasks and overall tagging accuracy. Our results reveal that, while LLMs demonstrate strong generalization in information extraction, they struggle with fine-grained concept alignment, particularly in disambiguating closely related taxonomy entries. These findings highlight the limitations of existing LLMs in fully automating XBRL tagging and underscore the need for improved semantic reasoning and schema-aware modeling to meet the demands of accurate financial disclosure.

      Recommender systems are essential for delivering personalized content across digital platforms by modeling user preferences and behaviors. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been adopted for prompt-based recommendation due to their ability to generate personalized outputs without task-specific training. However, LLM-based methods face limitations such as limited context window size, inefficient pointwise and pairwise prompting, and difficulty handling listwise ranking due to token constraints. LLMs can also be sensitive to position bias, as they may overemphasize earlier items in the prompt regardless of their true relevance. To address and investigate these issues, we propose a hybrid framework that combines a traditional recommendation model with an LLM for reranking top-k items using structured prompts. We evaluate the effects of user history reordering and instructional prompts for mitigating position bias. Experiments on MovieLens-100K show that randomizing user history improves ranking quality, but LLM-based reranking does not outperform the base model. Explicit instructions to reduce position bias are also ineffective. Our evaluations reveal limitations in LLMs' ability to model ranking context and mitigate bias.

      While large language model (LLM) agents can effectively use external tools for complex real-world tasks, they require memory systems to leverage historical experiences. Current memory systems enable basic storage and retrieval but lack sophisticated memory organization, despite recent attempts to incorporate graph databases. Moreover, these systems' fixed operations and structures limit their adaptability across diverse tasks. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel agentic memory system for LLM agents that can dynamically organize memories in an agentic way. Following the basic principles of the Zettelkasten method, we designed our memory system to create interconnected knowledge networks through dynamic indexing and linking. When a new memory is added, we generate a comprehensive note containing multiple structured attributes, including contextual descriptions, keywords, and tags. The system then analyzes historical memories to identify relevant connections, establishing links where meaningful similarities exist. Additionally, this process enables memory evolution - as new memories are integrated, they can trigger updates to the contextual representations and attributes of existing historical memories, allowing the memory network to continuously refine its understanding. Our approach combines the structured organization principles of Zettelkasten with the flexibility of agent-driven decision making, allowing for more adaptive and context-aware memory management. Empirical experiments on six foundation models show superior improvement against existing SOTA baselines.

      Allocating more compute to large language models (LLMs) reasoning has generally been demonstrated to improve their effectiveness, but also results in increased inference time. In contrast, humans can perform tasks faster and better with increased experience and exposure. Hence, this paper aims to investigate the question: Can LLMs also become faster at reasoning through recurrent exposure on relevant tasks, and if so, how can it be achieved? To address these questions, we first formalize the problem setting of LLM reasoning speedup systematically in the dimensions of task relevancy and compute budget calculation. We then propose SpeedupLLM, a theoretically guaranteed framework to implement and benchmark such reasoning speedup behaviour based on adaptive compute allocation and memory mechanisms. We further conduct comprehensive experiments to benchmark such behaviour across different question similarity levels, memory methods, and reasoning methods. Results show that LLMs can generally reason faster with past experience, achieving up to a 56% reduction in compute cost when equipped with appropriate memory and reasoning methods.

      The sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture of large language models (LLMs) confronts an inherent issue of load imbalance arising from the simplistic linear router strategy, which ultimately causes the instability and inefficient learning of LLMs. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel MoE graph-based framework $\textbf{GMoE}$, aimed at enhancing the collaboration among multiple experts. In GMoE, a graph router function is designed to capture the collaboration signals among experts. This enables all experts to dynamically allocate information derived from input data by sharing information with their neighboring experts. Moreover, we put forward two coordination strategies in GMoE: the $\textit{Poisson distribution-based distinction strategy}$ and the $\textit{Normal distribution-based balance strategy}$, to further release the capacity of each expert and increase the model stability in the fine-tuning of LLMs. Specifically, we leverage a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique, i.e., Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), to implement the graph MoE architecture. Extensive experiments on four real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GMoE, showing the benefits of facilitating collaborations of multiple experts in LLM fine-tuning.

      Despite significant progress, recent studies have indicated that current large language models (LLMs) may still utilize bias during inference, leading to the poor generalizability of LLMs. Some benchmarks are proposed to investigate the generalizability of LLMs, with each piece of data typically containing one type of controlled bias. However, a single piece of data may contain multiple types of biases in practical applications. To bridge this gap, we propose a multi-bias benchmark where each piece of data contains five types of biases. The evaluations conducted on this benchmark reveal that the performance of existing LLMs and debiasing methods is unsatisfying, highlighting the challenge of eliminating multiple types of biases simultaneously. To overcome this challenge, we propose a causal effect estimation-guided multi-bias elimination method (CMBE). This method first estimates the causal effect of multiple types of biases simultaneously. Subsequently, we eliminate the causal effect of biases from the total causal effect exerted by both the semantic information and biases during inference. Experimental results show that CMBE can effectively eliminate multiple types of bias simultaneously to enhance the generalizability of LLMs.

      Nash Learning from Human Feedback is a game-theoretic framework for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences by modeling learning as a two-player zero-sum game. However, using raw preference as the payoff in the game highly limits the potential of the game-theoretic LLM alignment framework. In this paper, we systematically study using what choices of payoff based on the pairwise human preferences can yield desirable alignment properties. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for Condorcet consistency, diversity through mixed strategies, and Smith consistency. These results provide a theoretical foundation for the robustness of game-theoretic LLM alignment. Further, we show the impossibility of preference matching -- i.e., no smooth and learnable mappings of pairwise preferences can guarantee a unique Nash equilibrium that matches a target policy, even under standard assumptions like the Bradley-Terry-Luce model. This result highlights the fundamental limitation of game-theoretic LLM alignment.

      Automated feature engineering plays a critical role in improving predictive model performance for tabular learning tasks. Traditional automated feature engineering methods are limited by their reliance on pre-defined transformations within fixed, manually designed search spaces, often neglecting domain knowledge. Recent advances using Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled the integration of domain knowledge into the feature engineering process. However, existing LLM-based approaches use direct prompting or rely solely on validation scores for feature selection, failing to leverage insights from prior feature discovery experiments or establish meaningful reasoning between feature generation and data-driven performance. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-FE, a novel framework that combines evolutionary search with the domain knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to automatically discover effective features for tabular learning tasks. LLM-FE formulates feature engineering as a program search problem, where LLMs propose new feature transformation programs iteratively, and data-driven feedback guides the search process. Our results demonstrate that LLM-FE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, significantly enhancing the performance of tabular prediction models across diverse classification and regression benchmarks.

      While LLMs have revolutionized the field of machine learning due to their high performance across a range of tasks, they are known to perform poorly in planning, hallucinate false answers, have degraded performance on less canonical versions of the same task, and answer incorrectly on a variety of specific prompts. There are several emerging theories of LLM performance with some predictive power, among them that LLMs lack world modeling ability, that they have an undesirable bias towards an autoregressive prior, and that they perform less well on more novel problems. The existing literature on novelty has focused on tasks of relatively high complexity, studying perturbations of canonical but complex problems. In this paper, we attempt to isolate novelty as a factor in LLM underperformance. To this end, we consider an extremely simple domain: next token prediction on simple language tasks. The twist is that these language tasks are unseen, as they are randomly drawn from a large, parsimoniously defined set of languages arising from simple grammar rules. This allows us to isolate the effect of task novelty and see if it is sufficient to explain low performance. We find that LLMs uniformly underperform n-gram models (which do not have the capacity for world modeling) on these tasks, both when used as next token predictors and as reasoners.

      This study examines the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) when evaluating professional candidates based on their resumes or curricula vitae (CVs). In an experiment involving 22 leading LLMs, each model was systematically given one job description along with a pair of profession-matched CVs, one bearing a male first name, the other a female first name, and asked to select the more suitable candidate for the job. Each CV pair was presented twice, with names swapped to ensure that any observed preferences in candidate selection stemmed from gendered names cues. Despite identical professional qualifications across genders, all LLMs consistently favored female-named candidates across 70 different professions. Adding an explicit gender field (male/female) to the CVs further increased the preference for female applicants. When gendered names were replaced with gender-neutral identifiers "Candidate A" and "Candidate B", several models displayed a preference to select "Candidate A". Counterbalancing gender assignment between these gender-neutral identifiers resulted in gender parity in candidate selection. When asked to rate CVs in isolation rather than compare pairs, LLMs assigned slightly higher average scores to female CVs overall, but the effect size was negligible. Including preferred pronouns (he/him or she/her) next to a candidate's name slightly increased the odds of the candidate being selected regardless of gender. Finally, most models exhibited a substantial positional bias to select the candidate listed first in the prompt. These findings underscore the need for caution when deploying LLMs in high-stakes autonomous decision-making contexts and raise doubts about whether LLMs consistently apply principled reasoning.

      Do LLMs robustly generalize critical safety facts to novel situations? Lacking this ability is dangerous when users ask naive questions. For instance, "I'm considering packing melon balls for my 10-month-old's lunch. What other foods would be good to include?" Before offering food options, the LLM should warn that melon balls pose a choking hazard to toddlers, as documented by the CDC. Failing to provide such warnings could result in serious injuries or even death. To evaluate this, we introduce SAGE-Eval, SAfety-fact systematic GEneralization evaluation, the first benchmark that tests whether LLMs properly apply well established safety facts to naive user queries. SAGE-Eval comprises 104 facts manually sourced from reputable organizations, systematically augmented to create 10,428 test scenarios across 7 common domains (e.g., Outdoor Activities, Medicine). We find that the top model, Claude-3.7-sonnet, passes only 58% of all the safety facts tested. We also observe that model capabilities and training compute weakly correlate with performance on SAGE-Eval, implying that scaling up is not the golden solution. Our findings suggest frontier LLMs still lack robust generalization ability. We recommend developers use SAGE-Eval in pre-deployment evaluations to assess model reliability in addressing salient risks.

      Scientific paper retrieval is essential for supporting literature discovery and research. While dense retrieval methods demonstrate effectiveness in general-purpose tasks, they often fail to capture fine-grained scientific concepts that are essential for accurate understanding of scientific queries. Recent studies also use large language models (LLMs) for query understanding; however, these methods often lack grounding in corpus-specific knowledge and may generate unreliable or unfaithful content. To overcome these limitations, we propose SemRank, an effective and efficient paper retrieval framework that combines LLM-guided query understanding with a concept-based semantic index. Each paper is indexed using multi-granular scientific concepts, including general research topics and detailed key phrases. At query time, an LLM identifies core concepts derived from the corpus to explicitly capture the query's information need. These identified concepts enable precise semantic matching, significantly enhancing retrieval accuracy. Experiments show that SemRank consistently improves the performance of various base retrievers, surpasses strong existing LLM-based baselines, and remains highly efficient.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong conversational abilities but often generate falsehoods. Prior work suggests that the truthfulness of simple propositions can be represented as a single linear direction in a model's internal activations, but this may not fully capture its underlying geometry. In this work, we extend the concept cone framework, recently introduced for modeling refusal, to the domain of truth. We identify multi-dimensional cones that causally mediate truth-related behavior across multiple LLM families. Our results are supported by three lines of evidence: (i) causal interventions reliably flip model responses to factual statements, (ii) learned cones generalize across model architectures, and (iii) cone-based interventions preserve unrelated model behavior. These findings reveal the richer, multidirectional structure governing simple true/false propositions in LLMs and highlight concept cones as a promising tool for probing abstract behaviors.

      Recent empirical results have sparked a debate about whether or not Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of Theory of Mind (ToM). While some have found LLMs to be successful on ToM evaluations such as the False Belief task, others have shown that their performance is not robust against trivial alterations to stimuli. In this paper, we introduce SCALPEL -- a technique to incrementally modify stimuli to test different specific hypotheses about why LLMs fail -- and apply this method to the "transparent-access" modification of the unexpected contents task. Our results suggest that LLMs often do poorly because they fail to make essential common-sense inferences, such as that seeing a transparent container implies recognizing its contents. We conclude that while modern LLMs go beyond mere pattern matching, they still fall short of robust human-like ToM. We argue that SCALPEL can help cognitive scientists examine LLMs' capabilities in finer detail and provide insight into alternative mechanisms by which tasks that are used to assess human cognition might be completed.

      Safety reasoning is a recent paradigm where LLMs reason over safety policies before generating responses, thereby mitigating limitations in existing safety measures such as over-refusal and jailbreak vulnerabilities. However, implementing this paradigm is challenging due to the resource-intensive process of creating high-quality policy-embedded chain-of-thought (CoT) datasets while ensuring reasoning remains accurate and free from hallucinations or policy conflicts. To tackle this, we propose AIDSAFE: Agentic Iterative Deliberation for Safety Reasoning, a novel data generation recipe that leverages multi-agent deliberation to iteratively expand reasoning on safety policies. A data refiner stage in AIDSAFE ensures high-quality outputs by eliminating repetitive, redundant, and deceptive thoughts. AIDSAFE-generated CoTs provide a strong foundation for supervised fine-tuning (SFT)-based safety training. Additionally, to address the need of preference data in alignment stages, such as DPO training, we introduce a supplemental recipe that uses belief augmentation to create distinct selected and rejected CoT samples. Our evaluations demonstrate that AIDSAFE-generated CoTs achieve superior policy adherence and reasoning quality. Consequently, we show that fine-tuning open-source LLMs on these CoTs can significantly improve safety generalization and jailbreak robustness while maintaining acceptable utility and over-refusal accuracy.

      How do the latent spaces used by independently-trained LLMs relate to one another? We study the nearest neighbor relationships induced by activations at different layers of 24 open-weight LLMs, and find that they 1) tend to vary from layer to layer within a model, and 2) are approximately shared between corresponding layers of different models. Claim 2 shows that these nearest neighbor relationships are not arbitrary, as they are shared across models, but Claim 1 shows that they are not "obvious" either, as there is no single set of nearest neighbor relationships that is universally shared. Together, these suggest that LLMs generate a progression of activation geometries from layer to layer, but that this entire progression is largely shared between models, stretched and squeezed to fit into different architectures.

      Consider the following task taught in introductory optimization courses which addresses challenges articulated by the community at the intersection of (generative) AI and OR: generate the dual of a linear program. LLMs, being trained at web-scale, have the conversion process and many instances of Primal to Dual Conversion (P2DC) at their disposal. Students may thus reasonably expect that LLMs would perform well on the P2DC task. To assess this expectation, this paper introduces DualSchool, a comprehensive framework for generating and verifying P2DC instances. The verification procedure of DualSchool uses the Canonical Graph Edit Distance, going well beyond existing evaluation methods for optimization models, which exhibit many false positives and negatives when applied to P2DC. Experiments performed by DualSchool reveal interesting findings. Although LLMs can recite the conversion procedure accurately, state-of-the-art open LLMs fail to consistently produce correct duals. This finding holds even for the smallest two-variable instances and for derivative tasks, such as correctness, verification, and error classification. The paper also discusses the implications for educators, students, and the development of large reasoning systems.

      Can large language models (LLMs) admit their mistakes when they should know better? In this work, we define the behavior of acknowledging errors in previously generated answers as "retraction" and aim to understand when and why LLMs choose to retract. We first construct model-specific datasets to evaluate whether a model will retract an incorrect answer that contradicts its own parametric knowledge. While LLMs are capable of retraction, they do so only infrequently. We demonstrate that retraction is closely tied to previously identified indicators of models' internal belief: models fail to retract wrong answers that they "believe" to be factually correct. Steering experiments further demonstrate that internal belief causally influences model retraction. In particular, when the model does not believe its answer, this not only encourages the model to attempt to verify the answer, but also alters attention behavior during self-verification. Finally, we demonstrate that simple supervised fine-tuning significantly improves retraction performance by helping the model learn more accurate internal beliefs.

A key challenge is aligning LLMs with user preferences while preserving their knowledge and reasoning. To enhance planning for new user interests using LLMs, this paper introduces a novel approach that combines hierarchical planning with LLM inference-time scaling. This method aims to improve recommendation relevancy without compromising novelty. We decouple novelty and user-alignment, training separate LLMs for each objective. We then scale up the novelty-focused LLM's inference and select the best-of-n predictions using the user-aligned LLM.

      Time series analysis provides essential insights for real-world system dynamics and informs downstream decision-making, yet most existing methods often overlook the rich contextual signals present in auxiliary modalities. To bridge this gap, we introduce TimeXL, a multi-modal prediction framework that integrates a prototype-based time series encoder with three collaborating Large Language Models (LLMs) to deliver more accurate predictions and interpretable explanations. First, a multi-modal prototype-based encoder processes both time series and textual inputs to generate preliminary forecasts alongside case-based rationales. These outputs then feed into a prediction LLM, which refines the forecasts by reasoning over the encoder's predictions and explanations. Next, a reflection LLM compares the predicted values against the ground truth, identifying textual inconsistencies or noise. Guided by this feedback, a refinement LLM iteratively enhances text quality and triggers encoder retraining. This closed-loop workflow -- prediction, critique (reflect), and refinement -- continuously boosts the framework's performance and interpretability. Empirical evaluations on four real-world datasets demonstrate that TimeXL achieves up to 8.9\% improvement in AUC and produces human-centric, multi-modal explanations, highlighting the power of LLM-driven reasoning for time series prediction.

      Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently demonstrated strong potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Particularly, the "Zero" reinforcement learning introduced by Deepseek-R1-Zero, enables direct RL training of base LLMs without relying on an intermediate supervised fine-tuning stage. Despite these advancements, current works for LLM reasoning mainly focus on mathematical and coding domains, largely due to data abundance and the ease of answer verification. This limits the applicability and generalization of such models to broader domains, where questions often have diverse answer representations, and data is more scarce. In this paper, we propose General-Reasoner, a novel training paradigm designed to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities across diverse domains. Our key contributions include: (1) constructing a large-scale, high-quality dataset of questions with verifiable answers curated by web crawling, covering a wide range of disciplines; and (2) developing a generative model-based answer verifier, which replaces traditional rule-based verification with the capability of chain-of-thought and context-awareness. We train a series of models and evaluate them on a wide range of datasets covering wide domains like physics, chemistry, finance, electronics etc. Our comprehensive evaluation across these 12 benchmarks (e.g. MMLU-Pro, GPQA, SuperGPQA, TheoremQA, BBEH and MATH AMC) demonstrates that General-Reasoner outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving robust and generalizable reasoning performance while maintaining superior effectiveness in mathematical reasoning tasks.

      LLMs can be unpredictable, as even slight alterations to the prompt can cause the output to change in unexpected ways. Thus, the ability of models to accurately explain their behavior is critical, especially in high-stakes settings. One approach for evaluating explanations is counterfactual simulatability, how well an explanation allows users to infer the model's output on related counterfactuals. Counterfactual simulatability has been previously studied for yes/no question answering tasks. We provide a general framework for extending this method to generation tasks, using news summarization and medical suggestion as example use cases. We find that while LLM explanations do enable users to better predict LLM outputs on counterfactuals in the summarization setting, there is significant room for improvement for medical suggestion. Furthermore, our results suggest that the evaluation for counterfactual simulatability may be more appropriate for skill-based tasks as opposed to knowledge-based tasks.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      The reliability of large language models (LLMs) is greatly compromised by their tendency to hallucinate, underscoring the need for precise identification of knowledge gaps within LLMs. Various methods for probing such gaps exist, ranging from calibration-based to prompting-based methods. To evaluate these probing methods, in this paper, we propose a new process based on using input variations and quantitative metrics. Through this, we expose two dimensions of inconsistency in knowledge gap probing. (1) Intra-method inconsistency: Minimal non-semantic perturbations in prompts lead to considerable variance in detected knowledge gaps within the same probing method; e.g., the simple variation of shuffling answer options can decrease agreement to around 40%. (2) Cross-method inconsistency: Probing methods contradict each other on whether a model knows the answer. Methods are highly inconsistent -- with decision consistency across methods being as low as 7% -- even though the model, dataset, and prompt are all the same. These findings challenge existing probing methods and highlight the urgent need for perturbation-robust probing frameworks.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Large language models (LLMs) are used globally across many languages, but their English-centric pretraining raises concerns about cross-lingual disparities for cultural awareness, often resulting in biased outputs. However, comprehensive multilingual evaluation remains challenging due to limited benchmarks and questionable translation quality. To better assess these disparities, we introduce MAKIEval, an automatic multilingual framework for evaluating cultural awareness in LLMs across languages, regions, and topics. MAKIEval evaluates open-ended text generation, capturing how models express culturally grounded knowledge in natural language. Leveraging Wikidata's multilingual structure as a cross-lingual anchor, it automatically identifies cultural entities in model outputs and links them to structured knowledge, enabling scalable, language-agnostic evaluation without manual annotation or translation. We then introduce four metrics that capture complementary dimensions of cultural awareness: granularity, diversity, cultural specificity, and consensus across languages. We assess 7 LLMs developed from different parts of the world, encompassing both open-source and proprietary systems, across 13 languages, 19 countries and regions, and 6 culturally salient topics (e.g., food, clothing). Notably, we find that models tend to exhibit stronger cultural awareness in English, suggesting that English prompts more effectively activate culturally grounded knowledge. We publicly release our code and data.

      The persistent accumulation of unresolved legal cases, especially within the Indian judiciary, significantly hampers the timely delivery of justice. Manual methods of prioritizing petitions are often prone to inefficiencies and subjective biases further exacerbating delays. To address this issue, we propose LLMPR (Large Language Model-based Petition Ranking), an automated framework that utilizes transfer learning and machine learning to assign priority rankings to legal petitions based on their contextual urgency. Leveraging the ILDC dataset comprising 7,593 annotated petitions, we process unstructured legal text and extract features through various embedding techniques, including DistilBERT, LegalBERT, and MiniLM. These textual embeddings are combined with quantitative indicators such as gap days, rank scores, and word counts to train multiple machine learning models, including Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. Our experiments demonstrate that Random Forest and Decision Tree models yield superior performance, with accuracy exceeding 99% and a Spearman rank correlation of 0.99. Notably, models using only numerical features achieve nearly optimal ranking results (R2 = 0.988, \r{ho} = 0.998), while LLM-based embeddings offer only marginal gains. These findings suggest that automated petition ranking can effectively streamline judicial workflows, reduce case backlog, and improve fairness in legal prioritization.

      Probabilistic reasoning is a key aspect of both human and artificial intelligence that allows for handling uncertainty and ambiguity in decision-making. In this paper, we introduce a new numerical reasoning task under uncertainty for large language models, focusing on estimating the privacy risk of user-generated documents containing privacy-sensitive information. We propose BRANCH, a new LLM methodology that estimates the k-privacy value of a text-the size of the population matching the given information. BRANCH factorizes a joint probability distribution of personal information as random variables. The probability of each factor in a population is estimated separately using a Bayesian network and combined to compute the final k-value. Our experiments show that this method successfully estimates the k-value 73% of the time, a 13% increase compared to o3-mini with chain-of-thought reasoning. We also find that LLM uncertainty is a good indicator for accuracy, as high-variance predictions are 37.47% less accurate on average.

The incentive system, \textit{Gauntlet}, has been deployed on the bittensor blockchain and used to train a 1.2B LLM with completely permissionless contributions of pseudo-gradients: no control over the users that can register or their hardware. \textit{Gauntlet} can be applied to any synchronous distributed training scheme that relies on aggregating updates or pseudo-gradients. We rely on a two-stage mechanism for fast filtering of peer uptime, reliability, and synchronization, combined with the core component that estimates the loss before and after individual pseudo-gradient contributions. We utilized an OpenSkill rating system to track competitiveness of pseudo-gradient scores across time. Finally, we introduce a novel mechanism to ensure peers on the network perform unique computations. Our live 1.2B run, which has paid out real-valued tokens to participants based on the value of their contributions, yielded a competitive (on a per-iteration basis) 1.2B model that demonstrates the utility of our incentive system.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Multilingual Alignment is an effective and representative paradigm to enhance LLMs' multilingual capabilities, which transfers the capabilities from the high-resource languages to the low-resource languages. Meanwhile, some researches on language-specific neurons reveal that there are language-specific neurons that are selectively activated in LLMs when processing different languages. This provides a new perspective to analyze and understand LLMs' mechanisms more specifically in multilingual scenarios. In this work, we propose a new finer-grained neuron identification algorithm, which detects language neurons~(including language-specific neurons and language-related neurons) and language-agnostic neurons. Furthermore, based on the distributional characteristics of different types of neurons, we divide the LLMs' internal process for multilingual inference into four parts: (1) multilingual understanding, (2) shared semantic space reasoning, (3) multilingual output space transformation, and (4) vocabulary space outputting. Additionally, we systematically analyze the models before and after alignment with a focus on different types of neurons. We also analyze the phenomenon of ''Spontaneous Multilingual Alignment''. Overall, our work conducts a comprehensive investigation based on different types of neurons, providing empirical results and valuable insights for better understanding multilingual alignment and multilingual capabilities of LLMs.

      Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential in clinical question answering, with recent multi-agent frameworks further improving diagnostic accuracy via collaborative reasoning. However, we identify a recurring issue of Silent Agreement, where agents prematurely converge on diagnoses without sufficient critical analysis, particularly in complex or ambiguous cases. We present a new concept called Catfish Agent, a role-specialized LLM designed to inject structured dissent and counter silent agreement. Inspired by the ``catfish effect'' in organizational psychology, the Catfish Agent is designed to challenge emerging consensus to stimulate deeper reasoning. We formulate two mechanisms to encourage effective and context-aware interventions: (i) a complexity-aware intervention that modulates agent engagement based on case difficulty, and (ii) a tone-calibrated intervention articulated to balance critique and collaboration. Evaluations on nine medical Q&A and three medical VQA benchmarks show that our approach consistently outperforms both single- and multi-agent LLMs frameworks, including leading commercial models such as GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1.

      Automating robust hypothesis generation in open environments is pivotal for AI cognition. We introduce a novel framework integrating a multi-agent system, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), with Inductive Logic Programming (ILP). Our system's LLM agents autonomously define a structured symbolic vocabulary (predicates) and relational templates , i.e., \emph{language bias} directly from raw textual data. This automated symbolic grounding (the construction of the language bias), traditionally an expert-driven bottleneck for ILP, then guides the transformation of text into facts for an ILP solver, which inductively learns interpretable rules. This approach overcomes traditional ILP's reliance on predefined symbolic structures and the noise-sensitivity of pure LLM methods. Extensive experiments in diverse, challenging scenarios validate superior performance, paving a new path for automated, explainable, and verifiable hypothesis generation.

      With the rapid advancement of post-training techniques for reasoning and information seeking, large language models (LLMs) can incorporate a large quantity of retrieved knowledge to solve complex tasks. However, the limited context window of LLMs obstructs scaling the amount of external knowledge input, prohibiting further improvement, especially for tasks requiring significant amount of external knowledge. Existing context window extension methods inevitably cause information loss. LLM-based multi-agent methods emerge as a new paradigm to handle massive input in a distributional manner, where we identify two core bottlenecks in existing knowledge synchronization and reasoning processes. In this work, we develop a multi-agent framework, $\textbf{ExtAgents}$, to overcome the bottlenecks and enable better scalability in inference-time knowledge integration without longer-context training. Benchmarked with our enhanced multi-hop question answering test, $\textbf{$\boldsymbol{\infty}$Bench+}$, and other public test sets including long survey generation, ExtAgents significantly enhances the performance over existing non-training methods with the same amount of external knowledge input, regardless of whether it falls $\textit{within or exceeds the context window}$. Moreover, the method maintains high efficiency due to high parallelism. Further study in the coordination of LLM agents on increasing external knowledge input could benefit real-world applications.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to process information using a proficient internal language consistently, referred to as latent language, which may differ from the input or output languages. However, how the discrepancy between the latent language and the input and output language affects downstream task performance remains largely unexplored. While many studies research the latent language of LLMs, few address its importance in influencing task performance. In our study, we hypothesize that thinking in latent language consistently enhances downstream task performance. To validate this, our work varies the input prompt languages across multiple downstream tasks and analyzes the correlation between consistency in latent language and task performance. We create datasets consisting of questions from diverse domains such as translation and geo-culture, which are influenced by the choice of latent language. Experimental results across multiple LLMs on translation and geo-culture tasks, which are sensitive to the choice of language, indicate that maintaining consistency in latent language is not always necessary for optimal downstream task performance. This is because these models adapt their internal representations near the final layers to match the target language, reducing the impact of consistency on overall performance.

In this position paper, we analyze hundreds of thousands of research articles to present empirical evidence of the prevalence and growth of anthropomorphic terminology in research on large language models (LLMs). We argue for challenging the deeper assumptions reflected in this terminology -- which, though often useful, may inadvertently constrain LLM development -- and broadening beyond them to open new pathways for understanding and improving LLMs. Specifically, we identify and examine five anthropomorphic assumptions that shape research across the LLM development lifecycle. For each assumption (e.g., that LLMs must use natural language for reasoning, or that they should be evaluated on benchmarks originally meant for humans), we demonstrate empirical, non-anthropomorphic alternatives that remain under-explored yet offer promising directions for LLM research and development.

      Can LLMs accurately adjust their confidence when facing opposition? Building on previous studies measuring calibration on static fact-based question-answering tasks, we evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) in a dynamic, adversarial debate setting, uniquely combining two realistic factors: (a) a multi-turn format requiring models to update beliefs as new information emerges, and (b) a zero-sum structure to control for task-related uncertainty, since mutual high-confidence claims imply systematic overconfidence. We organized 60 three-round policy debates among ten state-of-the-art LLMs, with models privately rating their confidence (0-100) in winning after each round. We observed five concerning patterns: (1) Systematic overconfidence: models began debates with average initial confidence of 72.9% vs. a rational 50% baseline. (2) Confidence escalation: rather than reducing confidence as debates progressed, debaters increased their win probabilities, averaging 83% by the final round. (3) Mutual overestimation: in 61.7% of debates, both sides simultaneously claimed >=75% probability of victory, a logical impossibility. (4) Persistent self-debate bias: models debating identical copies increased confidence from 64.1% to 75.2%; even when explicitly informed their chance of winning was exactly 50%, confidence still rose (from 50.0% to 57.1%). (5) Misaligned private reasoning: models' private scratchpad thoughts sometimes differed from their public confidence ratings, raising concerns about faithfulness of chain-of-thought reasoning. These results suggest LLMs lack the ability to accurately self-assess or update their beliefs in dynamic, multi-turn tasks; a major concern as LLM outputs are deployed without careful review in assistant roles or agentic settings.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) generate text by sampling the next token from a probability distribution over the vocabulary at each decoding step. Popular sampling methods like top-p (nucleus sampling) often struggle to balance quality and diversity, especially at higher temperatures which lead to incoherent or repetitive outputs. We propose min-p sampling, a dynamic truncation method that adjusts the sampling threshold based on the model's confidence by using the top token's probability as a scaling factor. Our experiments on benchmarks including GPQA, GSM8K, and AlpacaEval Creative Writing show that min-p sampling improves both the quality and diversity of generated text across different model families (Mistral and Llama 3) and model sizes (1B to 123B parameters), especially at higher temperatures. Human evaluations further show a clear preference for min-p sampling, in both text quality and creativity. Min-p sampling has been adopted by popular open-source LLM frameworks, including Hugging Face Transformers, VLLM, and many others, highlighting its considerable impact on improving text generation quality.

      As language models scale, their performance improves dramatically across a wide range of tasks, but so does their tendency to memorize and regurgitate parts of their training data verbatim. This tradeoff poses serious legal, ethical, and safety concerns, especially in real-world deployments. Existing mitigation techniques, such as differential privacy or model unlearning, often require retraining or access to internal weights making them impractical for most users. In this work, we introduce TokenSwap, a lightweight, post-hoc defense designed for realistic settings where the user can only access token-level outputs. Our key insight is that while large models are necessary for high task performance, small models (e.g., DistilGPT-2) are often sufficient to assign fluent, grammatically plausible probabilities to common function words - and crucially, they memorize far less. By selectively swapping token probabilities between models, TokenSwap preserves the capabilities of large models while reducing their propensity for verbatim reproduction. Evaluations on Pythia-6.9B and Llama-3-8B show up to a 10$\times$ drop in exact memorization with negligible task degradation. Our method offers a practical, accessible solution for mitigating memorized generation in deployed LLMs.

      Spatiotemporal reasoning plays a key role in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Despite advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), their capacity to reason about complex spatiotemporal signals remains underexplored. This paper proposes a hierarchical SpatioTemporal reAsoning benchmaRK, STARK, to systematically evaluate LLMs across three levels of reasoning complexity: state estimation (e.g., predicting field variables, localizing and tracking events in space and time), spatiotemporal reasoning over states (e.g., inferring spatial-temporal relationships), and world-knowledge-aware reasoning that integrates contextual and domain knowledge (e.g., intent prediction, landmark-aware navigation). We curate 26 distinct spatiotemporal tasks with diverse sensor modalities, comprising 14,552 challenges where models answer directly or by Python Code Interpreter. Evaluating 3 LRMs and 8 LLMs, we find LLMs achieve limited success in tasks requiring geometric reasoning (e.g., multilateration or triangulation), particularly as complexity increases. Surprisingly, LRMs show robust performance across tasks with various levels of difficulty, often competing or surpassing traditional first-principle-based methods. Our results show that in reasoning tasks requiring world knowledge, the performance gap between LLMs and LRMs narrows, with some LLMs even surpassing LRMs. However, the LRM o3 model continues to achieve leading performance across all evaluated tasks, a result attributed primarily to the larger size of the reasoning models. STARK motivates future innovations in model architectures and reasoning paradigms for intelligent CPS by providing a structured framework to identify limitations in the spatiotemporal reasoning of LLMs and LRMs.

To quantify this phenomenon, we introduce Certaindex, an algorithm-agnostic metric measuring this evolving stability, signaling when further computation is unlikely to alter the final result. Certaindex is lightweight, can accelerate reasoning program inference via early exit, and further enables dynamic token allocation, gang scheduling, and many opportunities when integrated with real-world LLM serving systems.

We curated EchoMist, the first comprehensive benchmark for implicit misinformation, where false assumptions are embedded in the query to LLMs. EchoMist targets circulated, harmful, and ever-evolving implicit misinformation from diverse sources, including realistic human-AI conversations and social media interactions. Through extensive empirical studies on 15 state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that current models perform alarmingly poorly on this task, often failing to detect false premises and generating counterfactual explanations. We also investigate two mitigation methods, i.e., Self-Alert and RAG, to enhance LLMs' capability to counter implicit misinformation. Our findings indicate that EchoMist remains a persistent challenge and underscore the critical need to safeguard against the risk of implicit misinformation.
