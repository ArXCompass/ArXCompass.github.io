      The adaptivity and maneuvering capabilities of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) have drawn significant attention in oceanic research, due to the unpredictable disturbances and strong coupling among the AUV's degrees of freedom. In this paper, we developed large language model (LLM)-enhanced reinforcement learning (RL)-based adaptive S-surface controller for AUVs. Specifically, LLMs are introduced for the joint optimization of controller parameters and reward functions in RL training. Using multi-modal and structured explicit task feedback, LLMs enable joint adjustments, balance multiple objectives, and enhance task-oriented performance and adaptability. In the proposed controller, the RL policy focuses on upper-level tasks, outputting task-oriented high-level commands that the S-surface controller then converts into control signals, ensuring cancellation of nonlinear effects and unpredictable external disturbances in extreme sea conditions. Under extreme sea conditions involving complex terrain, waves, and currents, the proposed controller demonstrates superior performance and adaptability in high-level tasks such as underwater target tracking and data collection, outperforming traditional PID and SMC controllers.

      Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) have entered the commercialization stage, but their limited ability to interact and express intentions still poses challenges in interactions with Human-driven Vehicles (HVs). Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable bidirectional human-machine communication, but the conflict between slow inference speed and the need for real-time decision-making challenges practical deployment. To address these issues, this paper introduces a parallel Actor-Reasoner framework designed to enable explicit bidirectional AV-HV interactions across multiple scenarios. First, by facilitating interactions between the LLM-driven Reasoner and heterogeneous simulated HVs during training, an interaction memory database, referred to as the Actor, is established. Then, by introducing the memory partition module and the two-layer memory retrieval module, the Actor's ability to handle heterogeneous HVs is significantly enhanced. Ablation studies and comparisons with other decision-making methods demonstrate that the proposed Actor-Reasoner framework significantly improves safety and efficiency. Finally, with the combination of the external Human-Machine Interface (eHMI) information derived from Reasoner's reasoning and the feasible action solutions retrieved from the Actor, the effectiveness of the proposed Actor-Reasoner is confirmed in multi-scenario field interactions.

      This tutorial presents a comprehensive introduction to Speculative Decoding (SD), an advanced technique for LLM inference acceleration that has garnered significant research interest in recent years. SD is introduced as an innovative decoding paradigm to mitigate the high inference latency stemming from autoregressive decoding in LLMs. At each decoding step, SD efficiently drafts several future tokens and then verifies them in parallel. This approach, unlike traditional autoregressive decoding, facilitates the simultaneous decoding of multiple tokens per step, thereby achieving promising 2x-4x speedups in LLM inference while maintaining original distributions. This tutorial delves into the latest techniques in SD, including draft model architectures and verification strategies. Additionally, it explores the acceleration potential and future research directions in this promising field. We aim for this tutorial to elucidate the current research landscape and offer insights for researchers interested in Speculative Decoding, ultimately contributing to more efficient LLM inference.

      Processing long contexts has become a critical capability for modern large language models (LLMs). However, serving long-context LLMs comes with significant inference costs due to the high memory overhead of the key-value (KV) cache. Existing work leverages dynamic sparse attention algorithms (DSAes) to mitigate the KV cache overhead, but these algorithms rely on top-$k$ KV cache selection, which results in a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. A larger $k$ improves accuracy but decreases efficiency, while a smaller $k$ boosts efficiency but compromises accuracy. To overcome this trade-off, this paper presents PSA, a $\underline{P}$rogressive $\underline{S}$parse $\underline{A}$ttention mechanism that integrates algorithmic innovations with system co-design to achieve both high inference accuracy and improved efficiency in LLM serving. The PSA algorithm adaptively adjusts the KV cache budget of different tokens and layers according to their real attention weight distributions, rather than relying on a fixed budget $k$. This enables high accuracy while minimizing KV cache usage. To further enhance execution efficiency, we introduce a pipelined iteration scheme that reduces CPU-GPU interleaving and synchronization overhead during PSA computation. Additionally, we implement unified GPU memory management that optimizes PSA's memory utilization by accounting for uneven memory requirements across different model layers. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that PSA reduces KV cache usage for attention computation by up to 2.4$\times$ and 8.8$\times$, and increases end-to-end serving throughput by up to 1.4$\times$ and 2.0$\times$, compared to state-of-the-art DSAes and systems without sparse attention, respectively.

      Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have expanded their context windows to unprecedented lengths, sparking debates about the necessity of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). To address the fragmented evaluation paradigms and limited cases in existing Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH), this paper introduces U-NIAH, a unified framework that systematically compares LLMs and RAG methods in controlled long context settings. Our framework extends beyond traditional NIAH by incorporating multi-needle, long-needle, and needle-in-needle configurations, along with different retrieval settings, while leveraging the synthetic Starlight Academy dataset-a fictional magical universe-to eliminate biases from pre-trained knowledge. Through extensive experiments, we investigate three research questions: (1) performance trade-offs between LLMs and RAG, (2) error patterns in RAG, and (3) RAG's limitations in complex settings. Our findings show that RAG significantly enhances smaller LLMs by mitigating the "lost-in-the-middle" effect and improving robustness, achieving an 82.58% win-rate over LLMs. However, we observe that retrieval noise and reverse chunk ordering degrade performance, while surprisingly, advanced reasoning LLMs exhibit reduced RAG compatibility due to sensitivity to semantic distractors. We identify typical error patterns including omission due to noise, hallucination under high noise critical condition, and self-doubt behaviors. Our work not only highlights the complementary roles of RAG and LLMs, but also provides actionable insights for optimizing deployments. Code: https://github.com/Tongji-KGLLM/U-NIAH.

      How human cognitive abilities are formed has long captivated researchers. However, a significant challenge lies in developing meaningful methods to measure these complex processes. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), which now rival human capabilities in various domains, we are presented with a unique testbed to investigate human cognition through a new lens. Among the many facets of cognition, one particularly crucial aspect is the concept of semantic size, the perceived magnitude of both abstract and concrete words or concepts. This study seeks to investigate whether LLMs exhibit similar tendencies in understanding semantic size, thereby providing insights into the underlying mechanisms of human cognition. We begin by exploring metaphorical reasoning, comparing how LLMs and humans associate abstract words with concrete objects of varying sizes. Next, we examine LLMs' internal representations to evaluate their alignment with human cognitive processes. Our findings reveal that multi-modal training is crucial for LLMs to achieve more human-like understanding, suggesting that real-world, multi-modal experiences are similarly vital for human cognitive development. Lastly, we examine whether LLMs are influenced by attention-grabbing headlines with larger semantic sizes in a real-world web shopping scenario. The results show that multi-modal LLMs are more emotionally engaged in decision-making, but this also introduces potential biases, such as the risk of manipulation through clickbait headlines. Ultimately, this study offers a novel perspective on how LLMs interpret and internalize language, from the smallest concrete objects to the most profound abstract concepts like love. The insights gained not only improve our understanding of LLMs but also provide new avenues for exploring the cognitive abilities that define human intelligence.

      The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural language processing. However, these models face challenges in retrieving precise information from vast datasets. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) was developed to combining LLMs with external information retrieval systems to enhance the accuracy and context of responses. Despite improvements, RAG still struggles with comprehensive retrieval in high-volume, low-information-density databases and lacks relational awareness, leading to fragmented answers. To address this, this paper introduces the Pseudo-Knowledge Graph (PKG) framework, designed to overcome these limitations by integrating Meta-path Retrieval, In-graph Text and Vector Retrieval into LLMs. By preserving natural language text and leveraging various retrieval techniques, the PKG offers a richer knowledge representation and improves accuracy in information retrieval. Extensive evaluations using Open Compass and MultiHop-RAG benchmarks demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in managing large volumes of data and complex relationships.

      Generalizing language-conditioned robotic policies to new tasks remains a significant challenge, hampered by the lack of suitable simulation benchmarks. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing GemBench, a novel benchmark to assess generalization capabilities of vision-language robotic manipulation policies. GemBench incorporates seven general action primitives and four levels of generalization, spanning novel placements, rigid and articulated objects, and complex long-horizon tasks. We evaluate state-of-the-art approaches on GemBench and also introduce a new method. Our approach 3D-LOTUS leverages rich 3D information for action prediction conditioned on language. While 3D-LOTUS excels in both efficiency and performance on seen tasks, it struggles with novel tasks. To address this, we present 3D-LOTUS++, a framework that integrates 3D-LOTUS's motion planning capabilities with the task planning capabilities of LLMs and the object grounding accuracy of VLMs. 3D-LOTUS++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on novel tasks of GemBench, setting a new standard for generalization in robotic manipulation.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown remarkable advancement in various NLP tasks. As such, a popular trend has emerged lately where NLP researchers extract word/sentence/document embeddings from these large decoder-only models and use them for various inference tasks with promising results. However, it is still unclear whether the performance improvement of LLM-induced embeddings is merely because of scale or whether underlying embeddings they produce significantly differ from classical encoding models like Word2Vec, GloVe, Sentence-BERT (SBERT) or Universal Sentence Encoder (USE). This is the central question we investigate in the paper by systematically comparing classical decontextualized and contextualized word embeddings with the same for LLM-induced embeddings. Our results show that LLMs cluster semantically related words more tightly and perform better on analogy tasks in decontextualized settings. However, in contextualized settings, classical models like SimCSE often outperform LLMs in sentence-level similarity assessment tasks, highlighting their continued relevance for fine-grained semantics.

      The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) often confronts challenges stemming from the heavy reliance on human annotators in the reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) framework, or the frequent and costly external queries tied to the self-instruct paradigm. In this work, we pivot to Reinforcement Learning (RL) -- but with a twist. Diverging from the typical RLHF, which refines LLMs following instruction data training, we use RL to directly generate the foundational instruction dataset that alone suffices for fine-tuning. Our method, TeaMs-RL, uses a suite of textual operations and rules, prioritizing the diversification of training datasets. It facilitates the generation of high-quality data without excessive reliance on external advanced models, paving the way for a single fine-tuning step and negating the need for subsequent RLHF stages. Our findings highlight key advantages of our approach: reduced need for human involvement and fewer model queries (only 5.73% of the strong baseline's total), along with enhanced capabilities of LLMs in crafting and comprehending complex instructions compared to strong baselines, and substantially improved model privacy protection.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are susceptible to security and safety threats, such as prompt injection, prompt extraction, and harmful requests. One major cause of these vulnerabilities is the lack of an instruction hierarchy. Modern LLM architectures treat all inputs equally, failing to distinguish between and prioritize various types of instructions, such as system messages, user prompts, and data. As a result, lower-priority user prompts may override more critical system instructions, including safety protocols. Existing approaches to achieving instruction hierarchy, such as delimiters and instruction-based training, do not address this issue at the architectural level. We introduce the Instructional Segment Embedding (ISE) technique, inspired by BERT, to modern large language models, which embeds instruction priority information directly into the model. This approach enables models to explicitly differentiate and prioritize various instruction types, significantly improving safety against malicious prompts that attempt to override priority rules. Our experiments on the Structured Query and Instruction Hierarchy benchmarks demonstrate an average robust accuracy increase of up to 15.75% and 18.68%, respectively. Furthermore, we observe an improvement in instruction-following capability of up to 4.1% evaluated on AlpacaEval. Overall, our approach offers a promising direction for enhancing the safety and effectiveness of LLM architectures.

      Low-resource languages face significant challenges due to the lack of sufficient linguistic data, resources, and tools for tasks such as supervised learning, annotation, and classification. This shortage hinders the development of accurate models and datasets, making it difficult to perform critical NLP tasks like sentiment analysis or hate speech detection. To bridge this gap, Large Language Models (LLMs) present an opportunity for potential annotators, capable of generating datasets and resources for these underrepresented languages. In this paper, we focus on Marathi, a low-resource language, and evaluate the performance of both closed-source and open-source LLMs as annotators, while also comparing these results with fine-tuned BERT models. We assess models such as GPT-4o and Gemini 1.0 Pro, Gemma 2 (2B and 9B), and Llama 3.1 (8B and 405B) on classification tasks including sentiment analysis, news classification, and hate speech detection. Our findings reveal that while LLMs excel in annotation tasks for high-resource languages like English, they still fall short when applied to Marathi. Even advanced models like GPT-4o and Llama 3.1 405B underperform compared to fine-tuned BERT-based baselines, with GPT-4o and Llama 3.1 405B trailing fine-tuned BERT by accuracy margins of 10.2% and 14.1%, respectively. This highlights the limitations of LLMs as annotators for low-resource languages.

      The efficacy of detectors for texts generated by large language models (LLMs) substantially depends on the availability of large-scale training data. However, white-box zero-shot detectors, which require no such data, are limited by the accessibility of the source model of the LLM-generated text. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective black-box zero-shot detection approach based on the observation that, from the perspective of LLMs, human-written texts typically contain more grammatical errors than LLM-generated texts. This approach involves calculating the Grammar Error Correction Score (GECScore) for the given text to differentiate between human-written and LLM-generated text. Experimental results show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) zero-shot and supervised methods, achieving an average AUROC of 98.62% across XSum and Writing Prompts dataset. Additionally, our approach demonstrates strong reliability in the wild, exhibiting robust generalization and resistance to paraphrasing attacks.

      The processing of numerical values is a rapidly developing area in the field of Language Models (LLMs). Despite numerous advancements achieved by previous research, significant challenges persist, particularly within the healthcare domain. This paper investigates the limitations of Transformer models in understanding numerical values. \textit{Objective:} this research aims to categorize numerical values extracted from medical documents into eight specific physiological categories using CamemBERT-bio. \textit{Methods:} In a context where scalable methods and Large Language Models (LLMs) are emphasized, we explore lifting the limitations of transformer-based models. We examine two strategies: fine-tuning CamemBERT-bio on a small medical dataset, integrating Label Embedding for Self-Attention (LESA), and combining LESA with additional enhancement techniques such as Xval. Given that CamemBERT-bio is already pre-trained on a large medical dataset, the first approach aims to update its encoder with the newly added label embeddings technique. In contrast, the second approach seeks to develop multiple representations of numbers (contextual and magnitude-based) to achieve more robust number embeddings. \textit{Results:} As anticipated, fine-tuning the standard CamemBERT-bio on our small medical dataset did not improve F1 scores. However, significant improvements were observed with CamemBERT-bio + LESA, resulting in an over 13\% increase. Similar enhancements were noted when combining LESA with Xval, outperforming conventional methods and giving comparable results to GPT-4 \textit{Conclusions and Novelty:} This study introduces two innovative techniques for handling numerical data, which are also applicable to other modalities. We illustrate how these techniques can improve the performance of Transformer-based models, achieving more reliable classification results even with small datasets.
