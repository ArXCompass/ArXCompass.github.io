      The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrates their potential to encapsulate the logic and patterns inherent in human behavior simulation by leveraging extensive web data pre-training. However, the boundaries of LLM capabilities in social simulation remain unclear. To further explore the social attributes of LLMs, we introduce the CiteAgent framework, designed to generate citation networks based on human-behavior simulation with LLM-based agents. CiteAgent successfully captures predominant phenomena in real-world citation networks, including power-law distribution, citational distortion, and shrinking diameter. Building on this realistic simulation, we establish two LLM-based research paradigms in social science: LLM-SE (LLM-based Survey Experiment) and LLM-LE (LLM-based Laboratory Experiment). These paradigms facilitate rigorous analyses of citation network phenomena, allowing us to validate and challenge existing theories. Additionally, we extend the research scope of traditional science of science studies through idealized social experiments, with the simulation experiment results providing valuable insights for real-world academic environments. Our work demonstrates the potential of LLMs for advancing science of science research in social science.

      Air quality monitoring is central to environmental sustainability and public health, yet traditional systems remain difficult for non-expert users to interpret due to complex visualizations, limited interactivity, and high deployment costs. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new opportunities to make sensor data more accessible, but their tendency to produce hallucinations limits reliability in safety-critical domains. To address these challenges, we present an LLM-enhanced Air Monitoring Interface (AMI) that integrates real-time sensor data with a conversational interface via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Our system grounds LLM outputs in live environmental data, enabling accurate, context-aware responses while reducing hallucination risk. The architecture combines a Django-based backend, a responsive user dashboard, and a secure MCP server that exposes system functions as discoverable tools, allowing the LLM to act as an active operator rather than a passive responder. Expert evaluation demonstrated high factual accuracy (4.78), completeness (4.82), and minimal hallucinations (4.84), on a scale of 5, supported by inter-rater reliability analysis. These results highlight the potential of combining LLMs with standardized tool protocols to create reliable, secure, and user-friendly interfaces for real-time environmental monitoring.

      Analog/mixed-signal circuits are key for interfacing electronics with the physical world. Their design, however, remains a largely handcrafted process, resulting in long and error-prone design cycles. While the recent rise of AI-based reinforcement learning and generative AI has created new techniques to automate this task, the need for many time-consuming simulations is a critical bottleneck hindering the overall efficiency. Furthermore, the lack of explainability of the resulting design solutions hampers widespread adoption of the tools. To address these issues, a novel agentic AI framework for sample-efficient and explainable analog circuit sizing is presented. It employs a multi-agent workflow where specialized Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents collaborate to interpret the circuit topology, to understand the design goals, and to iteratively refine the circuit's design parameters towards the target goals with human-interpretable reasoning. The adaptive simulation strategy creates an intelligent control that yields a high sample efficiency. The AnaFlow framework is demonstrated for two circuits of varying complexity and is able to complete the sizing task fully automatically, differently from pure Bayesian optimization and reinforcement learning approaches. The system learns from its optimization history to avoid past mistakes and to accelerate convergence. The inherent explainability makes this a powerful tool for analog design space exploration and a new paradigm in analog EDA, where AI agents serve as transparent design assistants.

      The ever-increasing computation and energy demand for LLM and AI agents call for holistic and efficient optimization of LLM serving systems. In practice, heterogeneous GPU clusters can be deployed in a geographically distributed manner, while LLM load also observes diversity in terms of both query traffic and serving patterns. LLM queries running on advanced GPUs during a high-emission hour at one location can lead to significantly higher carbon footprints versus same queries running on mid-level GPUs at a low-emission time and location. By observing LLM serving requirements and leveraging spatiotemporal computation flexibility, we consider the joint routing and scheduling problem, and propose FREESH to cooperatively run a group of data centers while minimizing user-specified carbon or energy objectives. FREESH identifies the optimal configurations of balanced load serving by matching distinct GPU instance's power-throughput characteristics with predictable LLM query length and workloads. To ensure both latency and fairness requirements, FREESH identifies optimized parallelism and query routing schedules together with dynamic GPU frequency scaling for power saving, and Least-Laxity-First (LLF) serving strategy for query scheduling. During the 1-hour serving on production workloads, FREESH reduces energy by 28.6% and emissions by 45.45% together with improvements in SLO attainment and fairness.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      The efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs) in online settings requires optimizing inference performance under stringent latency constraints, particularly the time-to-first-token (TTFT) and time-per-output-token (TPOT). This paper focuses on the query scheduling problem for LLM inference with prefix reuse, a technique that leverages shared prefixes across queries to reduce computational overhead. Our work reveals previously unknown limitations of the existing first-come-first-serve (FCFS) and longest-prefix-match (LPM) scheduling strategies with respect to satisfying latency constraints. We present a formal theoretical framework for LLM query scheduling under RadixAttention, a prefix reuse mechanism that stores and reuses intermediate representations in a radix tree structure. Our analysis establishes the NP-hardness of the scheduling problem with prefix reuse under TTFT constraints and proposes a novel scheduling algorithm, $k$-LPM, which generalizes existing methods by balancing prefix reuse and fairness in query processing. Theoretical guarantees demonstrate that $k$-LPM achieves improved TTFT performance under realistic traffic patterns captured by a data generative model. Empirical evaluations in a realistic serving setting validates our findings, showing significant reductions in P99 TTFT compared to baseline methods.

      Despite the impressive generative abilities of black-box large language models (LLMs), their inherent opacity hinders further advancements in capabilities such as reasoning, planning, and personalization. Existing works aim to enhance LLM capabilities via domain-specific adaptation, which require additional training on accessible model parameters, an infeasible option for black-box LLMs. To address this challenge, we introduce Matryoshka Pilot (M-Pilot), a lightweight white-box LLM controller that guides a large-scale black-box LLM generator by decomposing complex tasks into a series of intermediate outputs. Specifically, we consider the black-box LLM as an environment, with M-Pilot serving as a policy to provide intermediate guidance through prompts for driving the black-box LLM. M-Pilot is trained to pivot the outputs of the black-box LLM aligning with preferences during iterative interaction, which enables controllable multi-turn generation and self-improvement in optimizing intermediate guidance. Empirical evaluations on diverse tasks demonstrate that our method effectively enhances the capabilities of black-box LLMs in complex, long-horizon tasks.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      We study LLMs for tabular prediction with mixed text, numeric, and categorical fields. We introduce TabGemma, a schema-agnostic in-context learner that treats rows as sequences and tackles two practical hurdles when adapting pretrained LLMs for tabular predictions: unstable numeric tokenization and limited context size. We propose to canonicalize numbers via signed scientific notation and continue pretraining of a 12B Gemma 3 model with a target imputation objective using a large-scale real world dataset. For inference, we use a compact n-gram-based retrieval to select informative exemplars that fit within a 128k-token window. On semantically rich benchmarks, TabGemma establishes a new state of the art on classification across low- and high-data regimes and improves monotonically with more context rows. For regression, it is competitive at small sample sizes but trails conventional approaches as data grows. Our results show that LLMs can be effective tabular in-context learners on highly semantic tasks when paired with dedicated numeric handling and context retrieval, while motivating further advances in numeric modeling and long-context scaling.

      In this study, we explore the fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) to better support policymakers in their crucial work of understanding, analyzing, and crafting legal regulations. To equip the model with a deep understanding of legal texts, we curated a supervised dataset tailored to the specific needs of the legal domain. Additionally, we integrated the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) method, enabling the LLM to access and incorporate up-to-date legal knowledge from external sources. This combination of fine-tuning and RAG-based augmentation results in a tool that not only processes legal information but actively assists policymakers in interpreting regulations and drafting new ones that align with current needs. The results demonstrate that this approach can significantly enhance the effectiveness of legal research and regulation development, offering a valuable resource in the ever-evolving field of law.

      Quantized training of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains an open challenge, as maintaining accuracy while performing all matrix multiplications in low precision has proven difficult. This is particularly the case when fine-tuning pre-trained models, which can have large weight and activation outlier values that make lower-precision optimization difficult. To address this, we present HALO, a novel quantization-aware training approach for Transformers that enables accurate and efficient low-precision training by combining 1) strategic placement of Hadamard rotations in both forward and backward passes, which mitigate outliers, 2) high-performance kernel support, and 3) FSDP integration for low-precision communication. Our approach ensures that all large matrix multiplications during the forward and backward passes are executed in lower precision. Applied to LLAMA-family models, HALO achieves near-full-precision-equivalent results during fine-tuning on various tasks, while delivering up to 1.41x end-to-end speedup for full fine-tuning on RTX 4090 GPUs. HALO efficiently supports both standard and parameterefficient fine-tuning (PEFT). Our results demonstrate the first practical approach to fully quantized LLM fine-tuning that maintains accuracy in 8-bit precision, while delivering performance benefits.

      Understanding how well large language models can follow users' instructions throughout a dialogue spanning multiple topics is of great importance for data-intensive conversational applications. Existing benchmarks are often limited to a fixed number of turns, making them susceptible to saturation and failing to account for the user's interactive experience. In this work, we propose an extensible framework for assessing multi-turn instruction-following ability. At its core, our framework decouples linguistic surface forms from user intent simulation through a three-layer mechanism that tracks constraints, instructions, and topics. This framework mimics User-LLM interaction by enabling the dynamic construction of benchmarks with state changes and tracebacks, terminating a conversation only when the model exhausts a simulated user's patience. We define a suite of metrics capturing the quality of the interaction process. Using this framework, we construct EvolIF, an evolving instruction-following benchmark incorporating nine distinct constraint types. Our results indicate that GPT-5 exhibits superior instruction-following performance. It sustains an average of 18.54 conversational turns and demonstrates 70.31% robustness, outperforming Gemini-2.5-Pro by a significant margin of 11.41%, while other models lag far behind.

      Agentic AI systems and Physical or Embodied AI systems have been two key research verticals at the forefront of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, with Model Context Protocol (MCP) increasingly becoming a key component and enabler of agentic applications. However, the literature at the intersection of these verticals, i.e., Agentic Embodied AI, remains scarce. This paper introduces an MCP server for analyzing ROS and ROS 2 bags, allowing for analyzing, visualizing and processing robot data with natural language through LLMs and VLMs. We describe specific tooling built with robotics domain knowledge, with our initial release focused on mobile robotics and supporting natively the analysis of trajectories, laser scan data, transforms, or time series data. This is in addition to providing an interface to standard ROS 2 CLI tools ("ros2 bag list" or "ros2 bag info"), as well as the ability to filter bags with a subset of topics or trimmed in time. Coupled with the MCP server, we provide a lightweight UI that allows the benchmarking of the tooling with different LLMs, both proprietary (Anthropic, OpenAI) and open-source (through Groq). Our experimental results include the analysis of tool calling capabilities of eight different state-of-the-art LLM/VLM models, both proprietary and open-source, large and small. Our experiments indicate that there is a large divide in tool calling capabilities, with Kimi K2 and Claude Sonnet 4 demonstrating clearly superior performance. We also conclude that there are multiple factors affecting the success rates, from the tool description schema to the number of arguments, as well as the number of tools available to the models.

      Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks but remain computationally expensive, limiting their practical deployment. To address this, recent works have focused on distilling reasoning capabilities into smaller language models (sLMs) using chain-of-thought (CoT) traces from teacher LLMs. However, this approach struggles in scenarios requiring rare factual knowledge or precise computation, where sLMs often hallucinate due to limited capability. In this work, we propose Agent Distillation, a framework for transferring not only reasoning capability but full task-solving behavior from LLM-based agents into sLMs with retrieval and code tools. We improve agent distillation along two complementary axes: (1) we introduce a prompting method called first-thought prefix to enhance the quality of teacher-generated trajectories; and (2) we propose a self-consistent action generation for improving test-time robustness of small agents. We evaluate our method on eight reasoning tasks across factual and mathematical domains, covering both in-domain and out-of-domain generalization. Our results show that sLMs as small as 0.5B, 1.5B, 3B parameters can achieve performance competitive with next-tier larger 1.5B, 3B, 7B models fine-tuned using CoT distillation, demonstrating the potential of agent distillation for building practical, tool-using small agents.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Safety-aligned large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly widespread, especially in sensitive applications where fairness is essential and biased outputs can cause significant harm. However, evaluating the fairness of models is a complex challenge, and approaches that do so typically utilize standard question-answer (QA) styled schemes. Such methods often overlook deeper issues by interpreting the model's refusal responses as positive fairness measurements, which creates a false sense of fairness. In this work, we introduce the concept of silenced biases, which are unfair preferences encoded within models' latent space and are effectively concealed by safety-alignment. Previous approaches that considered similar indirect biases often relied on prompt manipulation or handcrafted implicit queries, which present limited scalability and risk contaminating the evaluation process with additional biases. We propose the Silenced Bias Benchmark (SBB), which aims to uncover these biases by employing activation steering to reduce model refusals during QA. SBB supports easy expansion to new demographic groups and subjects, presenting a fairness evaluation framework that encourages the future development of fair models and tools beyond the masking effects of alignment training. We demonstrate our approach over multiple LLMs, where our findings expose an alarming distinction between models' direct responses and their underlying fairness issues.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely deployed across various applications, yet their potential security and ethical risks have raised increasing concerns. Existing research employs red teaming evaluations, utilizing multi-turn jailbreaks to identify potential vulnerabilities in LLMs. However, these approaches often lack exploration of successful dialogue trajectories within the attack space, and they tend to overlook the considerable overhead associated with the attack process. To address these limitations, this paper first introduces a theoretical model based on dynamically weighted graph topology, abstracting the multi-turn attack process as a path planning problem. Based on this framework, we propose ABC, an enhanced Artificial Bee Colony algorithm for multi-turn jailbreaks, featuring a collaborative search mechanism with employed, onlooker, and scout bees. This algorithm significantly improves the efficiency of optimal attack path search while substantially reducing the average number of queries required. Empirical evaluations on three open-source and two proprietary language models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving attack success rates above 90\% across the board, with a peak of 98\% on GPT-3.5-Turbo, and outperforming existing baselines. Furthermore, it achieves comparable success with only 26 queries on average, significantly reducing red teaming overhead and highlighting its superior efficiency.

      Weight decay is a standard regularization technique for training large language models (LLMs). While it is common to assign a uniform decay rate to every layer, this approach overlooks the structural diversity of LLMs and the varying spectral properties across modules. In this paper, we introduce AlphaDecay, a simple yet effective method that adaptively assigns different weight decay strengths to each module of an LLM. Our approach is guided by Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR) theory, which analyzes the empirical spectral density (ESD) of weight correlation matrices to quantify "heavy-tailedness." Modules exhibiting more pronounced heavy-tailed ESDs, reflecting stronger feature learning, are assigned weaker decay, while modules with lighter-tailed spectra receive stronger decay. Our method leverages tailored weight decay assignments to balance the module-wise differences in spectral properties, leading to improved performance. Extensive pre-training tasks with various model sizes from 60M to 1B demonstrate that AlphaDecay achieves better perplexity and generalization than conventional uniform decay and other adaptive decay baselines.

      Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is emerging as a powerful technique to enhance the capabilities of Generative AI models by reducing hallucination. Thus, the increasing prominence of RAG alongside Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked interest in comparing the performance of different LLMs in question-answering (QA) in diverse domains. This study compares the performance of four open-source LLMs, Mistral-7b-instruct, LLaMa2-7b-chat, Falcon-7b-instruct and Orca-mini-v3-7b, and OpenAI's trending GPT-3.5 over QA tasks within the computer science literature leveraging RAG support. Evaluation metrics employed in the study include accuracy and precision for binary questions and ranking by a human expert, ranking by Google's AI model Gemini, alongside cosine similarity for long-answer questions. GPT-3.5, when paired with RAG, effectively answers binary and long-answer questions, reaffirming its status as an advanced LLM. Regarding open-source LLMs, Mistral AI's Mistral-7b-instruct paired with RAG surpasses the rest in answering both binary and long-answer questions. However, among the open-source LLMs, Orca-mini-v3-7b reports the shortest average latency in generating responses, whereas LLaMa2-7b-chat by Meta reports the highest average latency.

      Configuration tuning is critical for database performance. Although recent advancements in database tuning have shown promising results in throughput and latency improvement, challenges remain. First, the vast knob space makes direct optimization unstable and slow to converge. Second, reinforcement learning pipelines often lack effective warm-start guidance and require long offline training. Third, transferability is limited: when hardware or workloads change, existing models typically require substantial retraining to recover performance. To address these limitations, we propose L2T-Tune, a new LLM-guided hybrid database tuning framework that features a three-stage pipeline: Stage one performs a warm start that simultaneously generates uniform samples across the knob space and logs them into a shared pool; Stage two leverages a large language model to mine and prioritize tuning hints from manuals and community documents for rapid convergence. Stage three uses the warm-start sample pool to reduce the dimensionality of knobs and state features, then fine-tunes the configuration with the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm. We conduct experiments on L2T-Tune and the state-of-the-art models. Compared with the best-performing alternative, our approach improves performance by an average of 37.1% across all workloads, and by up to 73% on TPC-C. Compared with models trained with reinforcement learning, it achieves rapid convergence in the offline tuning stage on a single server. Moreover, during the online tuning stage, it only takes 30 steps to achieve best results.

      Tokenizers play a crucial role in determining the performance, training efficiency, and the inference cost of Large Language Models (LLMs). Designing effective tokenizers for multilingual LLMs is particularly challenging due to diverse scripts and rich morphological variation. While subword methods such as Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) are widely adopted, their effectiveness in multilingual settings remains underexplored. We present IndicSuperTokenizer, a tokenizer for Indic multilingual LLMs, that combines both subword and multi-word tokenization, along with language-specific pre-tokenization, leading to more linguistically aligned tokens and achieving a new state-of-the-art in fertility score. Evaluated across English, 22 Indian languages and code data, our tokenizer improves the average fertility score by 39.5% over LLaMA4 and by 18% over Sutra (the current best). This translates to 44% improvement in inference throughput over LLaMA4 while maintaining comparable performance on English and Indic benchmarks. We also present detailed ablations across tokenizer training data size, vocabulary size, merging techniques, and pre-tokenization strategies, demonstrating the robustness of our design choices.

      Atomic commits, which address a single development concern, are a best practice in software development. In practice, however, developers often produce tangled commits that mix unrelated changes, complicating code review and maintenance. Prior untangling approaches (rule-based, feature-based, or graph-based) have made progress but typically rely on shallow signals and struggle to distinguish explicit dependencies (e.g., control/data flow) from implicit ones (e.g., semantic or conceptual relationships). In this paper, we propose ColaUntangle, a new collaborative consultation framework for commit untangling that models both explicit and implicit dependencies among code changes. ColaUntangle integrates Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agents in a multi-agent architecture: one agent specializes in explicit dependencies, another in implicit ones, and a reviewer agent synthesizes their perspectives through iterative consultation. To capture structural and contextual information, we construct Explicit and Implicit Contexts, enabling agents to reason over code relationships with both symbolic and semantic depth. We evaluate ColaUntangle on two widely-used datasets (1,612 C# and 14k Java tangled commits). Experimental results show that ColaUntangle outperforms the best-performing baseline, achieving an improvement of 44% on the C# dataset and 82% on the Java dataset. These findings highlight the potential of LLM-based collaborative frameworks for advancing automated commit untangling tasks.

      The creation of high-quality datasets to improve Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning remains a significant challenge, as current methods often suffer from generating low-quality/incorrect answers and limited information richness from available data sources. To address this, we propose AgenticMath, a novel agentic pipeline for generating high-quality mathematical question-answer pairs to enhance the supervised fine-tuning of LLMs. Our method operates through four stages: (1) Seed Question Filter that selects questions with high information richness, complexity, and clarity; (2) an Agentic Question Rephrase step that employs a multi-agent system to generate diverse, logically consistent paraphrases; (3) an Answer Augment step where rewrite answers using chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance numerical and logical correctness, without reliance on human-provided labels; and (4) a final Question and Answer Evaluation that retains only the most superior pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, fine-tuning 3B-8B parameter LLMs on AgenticMath generated datasets (comprising only 30-60K math samples) achieves competitive or superior performance on diverse in domain and out-of-domain mathematical reasoning benchmarks compared to baselines trained on much more data (e.g., 400K or 2.3M samples). Our work demonstrates that targeted, high-quality data generation is a more efficient path to improving mathematical reasoning in LLMs than large-scale, low-quality alternatives.

      Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in software development. However, while LLMs remain static after pretraining, programming languages and APIs continue to evolve, leading to the generation of deprecated or incompatible code that undermines reliability. Retraining LLMs from scratch to reflect such changes is computationally expensive, making model editing a promising lightweight alternative that updates only a small subset of parameters. Despite its potential, it remains unclear whether model editing yields genuine syntactic and semantic adaptations or merely superficial fixes. In this work, we present a systematic study of five state-of-the-art model editing methods: Constrained Fine-Tuning (FT), GRACE, MEMIT, PMET, and ROME. We apply these methods to three leading open-source code LLMs, CodeLlama, CodeQwen1.5, and DeepSeek-Coder, under controlled API deprecation scenarios. Our evaluation covers both instant and sequential editing settings, using three disjoint evaluation sets designed to assess reliability, generalization, and specificity. We measure model correctness at three levels: successful compilation, partial test case pass, and full test pass. Our findings show that instant edits consistently degrade model performance, with syntactic validity dropping by up to 86 percentage points and functional correctness declining by 45 points even in the best-performing setting. Sequential edits further amplify this degradation, and in some cases, model performance collapses entirely. Across all models, most passing generations relied on workarounds rather than correctly adopting the intended changes, while faulty adoptions that result in test failures or compilation errors were significantly more frequent. Correct adoptions, where the model correctly integrates the intended change, occurred in only about 6% of cases.

      We present a systematic study of subtraction in large language models (LLMs). While prior benchmarks emphasize addition and multiplication, subtraction has received comparatively little attention despite being structurally distinct as a non-commutative operation. We evaluate eight pretrained LLMs spanning four families on addition and subtraction problems. Our experiments reveal that subtraction accuracy lags behind addition by a wide margin. We find that the errors for ($a-b$) are concentrated in cases where ($a<b$). In such cases, LLMs frequently produce the correct magnitude but omit the negative sign. Probing analyses show that LLMs internally encode whether results should be negative, yet this information is often not reflected in generated outputs. We further test well-known techniques such as few-shot learning and instruction-tuning to see if they can improve the LLMs' performance. Our results suggest that while few-shot prompting yields modest gains, the instruction-tuned models achieve near-perfect accuracies in generating the negative sign. Together, these findings provide a clearer characterization of the limitations and recoverability of LLMs' arithmetic capabilities in subtraction.

      Training agents to operate under strict constraints during deployment, such as limited resource budgets or stringent safety requirements, presents significant challenges, especially when these constraints render the task complex. In this work, we propose a curriculum learning strategy that gradually tightens constraints during training, enabling the agent to incrementally master the deployment requirements. Inspired by self-paced learning techniques in unconstrained reinforcement learning (RL), our approach facilitates a smoother transition to challenging environments by initially training on simplified versions of the constraints and progressively introducing the full deployment conditions. We provide a theoretical analysis using an RL agent in a binary-tree Markov Decision Process (MDP) to demonstrate that our curriculum strategy can accelerate training relative to a baseline approach that imposes the trajectory constraints from the outset. Moreover, we empirically validate the effectiveness and generality of our method across both RL and large language model (LLM) agents in diverse settings, including a binary-tree MDP, a multi-task navigation domain, and a math reasoning task with two benchmarks. These results highlight the potential of curriculum design in enhancing the efficiency and performance of agents operating under complex trajectory constraints during deployment. Moreover, when applied to LLMs, our strategy enables compression of output chain-of-thought tokens, achieving a substantial inference speedup on consumer hardware, demonstrating its effectiveness for resource-constrained deployment.

      Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly prevalent across diverse applications. However, their enormous size limits storage and processing capabilities to a few well-resourced stakeholders. As a result, most applications rely on pre-trained LLMs, fine-tuned for specific tasks. However, even storing the fine-tuned versions of these models remains a significant challenge due to the wide range of tasks they address. Recently, studies show that fine-tuning these models primarily affects a small fraction of parameters, highlighting the need for more efficient storage of fine-tuned models. This paper focuses on efficient storage of parameter updates in pre-trained models after fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we leverage the observation that fine-tuning updates are both low-rank and sparse, which can be utilized for storage efficiency. However, using only low-rank approximation or sparsification may discard critical singular components that enhance model expressivity. We first observe that given the same memory budget, sparsified low-rank approximations with larger ranks outperform standard low-rank approximations with smaller ranks. Building on this, we propose our method, optimal singular damage, that selectively sparsifies low-rank approximated updates by leveraging the interleaved importance of singular vectors, ensuring that the most impactful components are retained. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that our proposed methods lead to significant storage efficiency and superior accuracy within the same memory budget compared to employing the low-rank approximation or sparsification individually.

      As LLM-based agents become increasingly autonomous and will more freely interact with each other, studying the interplay among them becomes crucial to anticipate emergent phenomena and potential risks. In this work, we provide an in-depth analysis of the interactions among agents within a simulated hierarchical social environment, drawing inspiration from the Stanford Prison Experiment. Leveraging 2,400 conversations across six LLMs (i.e., LLama3, Orca2, Command-r, Mixtral, Mistral2, and gpt4.1) and 240 experimental scenarios, we analyze persuasion and anti-social behavior between a guard and a prisoner agent with differing objectives. We first document model-specific conversational failures in this multi-agent power dynamic context, thereby narrowing our analytic sample to 1,600 conversations. Among models demonstrating successful interaction, we find that goal setting significantly influences persuasiveness but not anti-social behavior. Moreover, agent personas, especially the guard's, substantially impact both successful persuasion by the prisoner and the manifestation of anti-social actions. Notably, we observe the emergence of anti-social conduct even in absence of explicit negative personality prompts. These results have important implications for the development of interactive LLM agents and the ongoing discussion of their societal impact.

      Judgmental forecasting is the task of making predictions about future events based on human judgment. This task can be seen as a form of claim verification, where the claim corresponds to a future event and the task is to assess the plausibility of that event. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent framework for claim verification, whereby different agents may disagree on claim veracity and bring specific evidence for and against the claims, represented as quantitative bipolar argumentation frameworks (QBAFs). We then instantiate the framework for supporting claim verification, with a variety of agents realised with Large Language Models (LLMs): (1) ArgLLM agents, an existing approach for claim verification that generates and evaluates QBAFs; (2) RbAM agents, whereby LLM-empowered Relation-based Argument Mining (RbAM) from external sources is used to generate QBAFs; (3) RAG-ArgLLM agents, extending ArgLLM agents with a form of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) of arguments from external sources. Finally, we conduct experiments with two standard judgmental forecasting datasets, with instances of our framework with two or three agents, empowered by six different base LLMs. We observe that combining evidence from agents can improve forecasting accuracy, especially in the case of three agents, while providing an explainable combination of evidence for claim verification.

While many jailbreaks and defenses exist, their cross-lingual generalization remains underexplored. This paper presents the first systematic multilingual evaluation of jailbreaks and defenses across ten languages -- spanning high-, medium-, and low-resource languages -- using six LLMs on HarmBench and AdvBench. We assess two jailbreak types: logical-expression-based and adversarial-prompt-based. For both types, attack success and defense robustness vary across languages: high-resource languages are safer under standard queries but more vulnerable to adversarial ones. Simple defenses can be effective, but are language- and model-dependent. These findings call for language-aware and cross-lingual safety benchmarks for LLMs.

      Large language models (LLMs) are proliferating rapidly at the edge, delivering intelligent capabilities across diverse application scenarios. However, their practical deployment in collaborative scenarios confronts fundamental challenges: privacy vulnerabilities, communication overhead, and computational bottlenecks. To address these, we propose Federated Attention (FedAttn), which integrates the federated paradigm into the self-attention mechanism, creating a new distributed LLM inference framework that simultaneously achieves privacy protection, communication efficiency, and computational efficiency. FedAttn enables participants to perform local self-attention over their own token representations while periodically exchanging and aggregating Key-Value (KV) matrices across multiple Transformer blocks, collaboratively generating LLM responses without exposing private prompts. Further, we identify a structural duality between contextual representation refinement in FedAttn and parameter optimization in FL across private data, local computation, and global aggregation. This key insight provides a principled foundation for systematically porting federated optimization techniques to collaborative LLM inference. Building on this framework, we theoretically analyze how local self-attention computation within participants and heterogeneous token relevance among participants shape error propagation dynamics across Transformer blocks. Moreover, we characterize the fundamental trade-off between response quality and communication/computation efficiency, which is governed by the synchronization interval and the number of participants. Experimental results validate our theoretical analysis, and reveal significant optimization opportunities through sparse attention and adaptive KV aggregation, highlighting FedAttn's potential to deliver scalability and efficiency in real-world edge deployments.

      Previous studies show that introducing new knowledge during large language models (LLMs) fine-tuning can lead to the generation of erroneous output when tested on known information, thereby triggering factual hallucinations. However, existing studies have not deeply investigated the specific manifestations and underlying mechanisms of these hallucinations. Our work addresses this gap by designing a controlled dataset Biography-Reasoning, and conducting a fine-grained analysis across multiple knowledge types and two task types, including knowledge question answering (QA) and knowledge reasoning tasks. We find that when fine-tuned on a dataset in which a specific knowledge type consists entirely of new knowledge, LLMs exhibit significantly increased hallucination tendencies. This suggests that the high unfamiliarity of a particular knowledge type, rather than the overall proportion of new knowledge, is a stronger driver of hallucinations, and these tendencies can even affect other knowledge types in QA tasks. To mitigate such factual hallucinations, we propose KnownPatch, which patches a small number of known knowledge samples in the later stages of training, effectively alleviating new-knowledge-induced hallucinations. Through attention analysis, we find that learning new knowledge reduces the model's attention to key entities in the question, thus causing excessive focus on the surrounding context, which may increase the risk of hallucination. Moreover, the attention pattern can propagate to similar contexts, facilitating the spread of hallucinations to textually similar questions. Our method effectively mitigates the disruption of new knowledge learning to the model's attention on key entities, accompanied by improved performance.

      The alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values is central to their safe deployment, yet current practice produces static, brittle, and costly-to-maintain models that fail to keep pace with evolving norms and policies. This misalignment, which we term the Alignment-Reality Gap, poses a growing challenge for reliable long-term use. Existing remedies are inadequate: large-scale re-annotation is economically prohibitive, and standard unlearning methods act as blunt instruments that erode utility rather than enable precise policy updates. We introduce TRACE (Triage and Re-align by Alignment Conflict Evaluation), a framework for principled unlearning that reconceives re-alignment as a programmatic policy application problem. TRACE programmatically triages existing preference data against a new policy, identifies high-impact conflicts via a alignment impact score, and applies a hybrid optimization that cleanly inverts, discards, or preserves preferences while safeguarding model performance. Empirical results show that TRACE achieves robust re-alignment across diverse model families (Qwen2.5-7B, Gemma-2-9B, Llama-3.1-8B). On both synthetic benchmarks and the PKU-SafeRLHF dataset under complex policy shift, TRACE enforces new principles without degrading general capabilities. Our work establishes a scalable, dynamic, and cost-effective paradigm for maintaining LLM alignment, providing a foundation for sustainable and responsible AI deployment.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in natural language tasks, but less is known about their reasoning capabilities over tabular data. Prior analyses devise evaluation strategies that poorly reflect an LLM's realistic performance on tabular queries. Moreover, we have a limited understanding of the robustness of LLMs towards realistic variations in tabular inputs. Therefore, we ask: Can general-purpose LLMs reason over tabular data, really?, and focus on two questions 1) are tabular reasoning capabilities of general-purpose LLMs robust to real-world characteristics of tabular inputs, and 2) how can we realistically evaluate an LLM's performance on analytical tabular queries? Building on a recent tabular reasoning benchmark, we first surface shortcomings of its multiple-choice prompt evaluation strategy, as well as commonly used free-form text metrics such as SacreBleu and BERT-score. We show that an LLM-as-a-judge procedure yields more reliable performance insights and unveil a significant deficit in tabular reasoning performance of LLMs. We then extend the tabular inputs reflecting three common characteristics in practice: 1) missing values, 2) duplicate entities, and 3) structural variations. Experiments show that the tabular reasoning capabilities of general-purpose LLMs suffer from these variations, stressing the importance of improving their robustness for realistic tabular inputs.

      Modelling student knowledge is a key challenge when leveraging AI in education, with major implications for personalised learning. The Knowledge Tracing (KT) task aims to predict how students will respond to educational questions in learning environments, based on their prior interactions. Existing KT models typically use response correctness along with metadata like skill tags and timestamps, often overlooking the question text, which is an important source of pedagogical insight. This omission poses a lost opportunity while limiting predictive performance. We propose Next Token Knowledge Tracing (NTKT), a novel approach that reframes KT as a next-token prediction task using pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs). NTKT represents both student histories and question content as sequences of text, allowing LLMs to learn patterns in both behaviour and language. Our series of experiments significantly improves performance over state-of-the-art neural KT models and generalises much better to cold-start questions and users. These findings highlight the importance of question content in KT and demonstrate the benefits of leveraging pretrained representations of LLMs to model student learning more effectively.

This paper examines the reasoning and self-assessment abilities of LLMs across seven major Indian languages-Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, and Telugu. We introduce a multilingual riddle dataset combining traditional riddles with context-reconstructed variants and evaluate five LLMs-Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Mistral-Saba, LLaMA 4 Scout, and LLaMA 4 Maverick-under seven prompting strategies. In the first stage, we assess riddle-solving performance and find that while Gemini 2.5 Pro performs best overall, few-shot methods yield only marginal gains, and accuracy varies notably across languages. In the second stage, we conduct a self-evaluation experiment to measure reasoning consistency. The results reveal a key finding: a model's initial accuracy is inversely correlated with its ability to identify its own mistakes. Top-performing models such as Gemini 2.5 Pro are overconfident (4.34% True Negative Rate), whereas lower-performing models like LLaMA 4 Scout are substantially more self-aware (42.09% True Negative Rate). These results point to clear gaps in multilingual reasoning and highlight the need for models that not only reason effectively but also recognize their own limitations.

      While new benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) are being developed continuously to catch up with the growing capabilities of new models and AI in general, using and evaluating LLMs in non-English languages remains a little-charted landscape.

We show that LLMs can be utilized to generate proofs by induction for hardware verification and thereby replace some of the manual work done by Formal Verification engineers and deliver industrial value. We present a neurosymbolic approach that includes two prompting frameworks to generate candidate invariants, which are checked using a formal, symbolic tool. Our results indicate that with sufficient reprompting, LLMs are able to generate inductive arguments for mid-size open-source RTL designs. For $87\%$ of our problem set, at least one of the prompt setups succeeded in producing a provably correct inductive argument.

      As Large Language Models (LLMs) grow in capability, do they develop self-awareness as an emergent behavior? And if so, can we measure it? We introduce the AI Self-Awareness Index (AISAI), a game-theoretic framework for measuring self-awareness through strategic differentiation. Using the "Guess 2/3 of Average" game, we test 28 models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) across 4,200 trials with three opponent framings: (A) against humans, (B) against other AI models, and (C) against AI models like you. We operationalize self-awareness as the capacity to differentiate strategic reasoning based on opponent type. Finding 1: Self-awareness emerges with model advancement. The majority of advanced models (21/28, 75%) demonstrate clear self-awareness, while older/smaller models show no differentiation. Finding 2: Self-aware models rank themselves as most rational. Among the 21 models with self-awareness, a consistent rationality hierarchy emerges: Self > Other AIs > Humans, with large AI attribution effects and moderate self-preferencing. These findings reveal that self-awareness is an emergent capability of advanced LLMs, and that self-aware models systematically perceive themselves as more rational than humans. This has implications for AI alignment, human-AI collaboration, and understanding AI beliefs about human capabilities.

      The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) induces a critical vulnerability: the potential for dishonest manipulation by service providers. This manipulation can manifest in various forms, such as secretly substituting a proclaimed high-performance model with a low-cost alternative, or inflating responses with meaningless tokens to increase billing. This work tackles the issue through the lens of algorithmic game theory and mechanism design. We are the first to propose a formal economic model for a realistic user-provider ecosystem, where a user can iteratively delegate $T$ queries to multiple model providers, and providers can engage in a range of strategic behaviors. As our central contribution, we prove that for a continuous strategy space and any $\epsilon\in(0,\frac12)$, there exists an approximate incentive-compatible mechanism with an additive approximation ratio of $O(T^{1-\epsilon}\log T)$, and a guaranteed quasi-linear second-best user utility. We also prove an impossibility result, stating that no mechanism can guarantee an expected user utility that is asymptotically better than our mechanism. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our mechanism in simulation experiments with real-world API settings.

This survey provides a formal definition of mid-training for large language models (LLMs) and investigates optimization frameworks that encompass data curation, training strategies, and model architecture optimization. We analyze mainstream model implementations in the context of objective-driven interventions, illustrating how mid-training serves as a distinct and critical stage in the progressive development of LLM capabilities.

      Accurately forecasting central bank policy decisions, particularly those of the Federal Open Market Committee(FOMC) has become increasingly important amid heightened economic uncertainty. While prior studies have used monetary policy texts to predict rate changes, most rely on static classification models that overlook the deliberative nature of policymaking. This study proposes a novel framework that structurally imitates the FOMC's collective decision-making process by modeling multiple large language models(LLMs) as interacting agents. Each agent begins with a distinct initial belief and produces a prediction based on both qualitative policy texts and quantitative macroeconomic indicators. Through iterative rounds, agents revise their predictions by observing the outputs of others, simulating deliberation and consensus formation. To enhance interpretability, we introduce a latent variable representing each agent's underlying belief(e.g., hawkish or dovish), and we theoretically demonstrate how this belief mediates the perception of input information and interaction dynamics. Empirical results show that this debate-based approach significantly outperforms standard LLMs-based baselines in prediction accuracy. Furthermore, the explicit modeling of beliefs provides insights into how individual perspectives and social influence shape collective policy forecasts.

      We evaluate whether persona-based prompting improves Large Language Model (LLM) performance on macroeconomic forecasting tasks. Using 2,368 economics-related personas from the PersonaHub corpus, we prompt GPT-4o to replicate the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters across 50 quarterly rounds (2013-2025). We compare the persona-prompted forecasts against the human experts panel, across four target variables (HICP, core HICP, GDP growth, unemployment) and four forecast horizons. We also compare the results against 100 baseline forecasts without persona descriptions to isolate its effect. We report two main findings. Firstly, GPT-4o and human forecasters achieve remarkably similar accuracy levels, with differences that are statistically significant yet practically modest. Our out-of-sample evaluation on 2024-2025 data demonstrates that GPT-4o can maintain competitive forecasting performance on unseen events, though with notable differences compared to the in-sample period. Secondly, our ablation experiment reveals no measurable forecasting advantage from persona descriptions, suggesting these prompt components can be omitted to reduce computational costs without sacrificing accuracy. Our results provide evidence that GPT-4o can achieve competitive forecasting accuracy even on out-of-sample macroeconomic events, if provided with relevant context data, while revealing that diverse prompts produce remarkably homogeneous forecasts compared to human panels.

      While LLMs excel at general tasks, they struggle in specialized domains like finance, requiring diverse skills in domain knowledge, mathematical reasoning, and multilingual processing. Merging domain-specific Continual Pre-training (CPT) "experts" offers a practical alternative to costly and unstable multi-skill training. However, unlike established Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) model-based merging, CPT model merging remains largely unexplored. We address this gap by creating financial LLMs from experts in finance, math, and Japanese. We propose a three-stage evaluation focusing on knowledge recovery, complementarity, and emergence, and assess three merging methods (Task Arithmetic, TIES, and DARE-TIES) on a comprehensive financial benchmark curated from 18 tasks across 8 established datasets. Results show that merging an expert with its base model recovers general knowledge lost during CPT, while merging experts improves performance and can yield emergent cross-domain skills. Among the methods, Task Arithmetic performs strongly but is hyperparameter-sensitive, whereas TIES is more robust. Our findings also suggest that while model similarity correlates with merging success, emergent skills depend on more complex factors. This work presents the first foundational analysis of CPT model merging, establishing a principled framework and providing clear guidance for building multi-skill LLMs from existing assets.

      The rapid adoption of Large Language Model (LLM) agents and multi-agent systems enables remarkable capabilities in natural language processing and generation. However, these systems introduce security vulnerabilities that extend beyond traditional content generation to system-level compromises. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the LLMs security used as reasoning engines within autonomous agents, highlighting how they can be exploited as attack vectors capable of achieving computer takeovers. We focus on how different attack surfaces and trust boundaries can be leveraged to orchestrate such takeovers. We demonstrate that adversaries can effectively coerce popular LLMs into autonomously installing and executing malware on victim machines. Our evaluation of 18 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals an alarming scenario: 94.4% of models succumb to Direct Prompt Injection, and 83.3% are vulnerable to the more stealthy and evasive RAG Backdoor Attack. Notably, we tested trust boundaries within multi-agent systems, where LLM agents interact and influence each other, and we revealed that LLMs which successfully resist direct injection or RAG backdoor attacks will execute identical payloads when requested by peer agents. We found that 100.0% of tested LLMs can be compromised through Inter-Agent Trust Exploitation attacks, and that every model exhibits context-dependent security behaviors that create exploitable blind spots.

      Identifying architecturally relevant entities in textual artifacts is crucial for Traceability Link Recovery (TLR) between Software Architecture Documentation (SAD) and source code. While Software Architecture Models (SAMs) can bridge the semantic gap between these artifacts, their manual creation is time-consuming. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new capabilities for extracting architectural entities from SAD and source code to construct SAMs automatically or establish direct trace links. This paper presents two LLM-based approaches: ExArch extracts component names as simple SAMs from SAD and source code to eliminate the need for manual SAM creation, while ArTEMiS identifies architectural entities in documentation and matches them with (manually or automatically generated) SAM entities. Our evaluation compares against state-of-the-art approaches SWATTR, TransArC and ArDoCode. TransArC achieves strong performance (F1: 0.87) but requires manually created SAMs; ExArch achieves comparable results (F1: 0.86) using only SAD and code. ArTEMiS is on par with the traditional heuristic-based SWATTR (F1: 0.81) and can successfully replace it when integrated with TransArC. The combination of ArTEMiS and ExArch outperforms ArDoCode, the best baseline without manual SAMs. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can effectively identify architectural entities in textual artifacts, enabling automated SAM generation and TLR, making architecture-code traceability more practical and accessible.

      Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled significant progress in decision-making and task planning for embodied autonomous agents. However, most existing methods still struggle with complex, long-horizon tasks because they rely on a monolithic trajectory that entangles all past decisions and observations, attempting to solve the entire task in a single unified process. To address this limitation, we propose ReAcTree, a hierarchical task-planning method that decomposes a complex goal into more manageable subgoals within a dynamically constructed agent tree. Each subgoal is handled by an LLM agent node capable of reasoning, acting, and further expanding the tree, while control flow nodes coordinate the execution strategies of agent nodes. In addition, we integrate two complementary memory systems: each agent node retrieves goal-specific, subgoal-level examples from episodic memory and shares environment-specific observations through working memory. Experiments on the WAH-NL and ALFRED datasets demonstrate that ReAcTree consistently outperforms strong task-planning baselines such as ReAct across diverse LLMs. Notably, on WAH-NL, ReAcTree achieves a 61% goal success rate with Qwen 2.5 72B, nearly doubling ReAct's 31%.

      Recent advances in large language model agents offer the promise of automating end-to-end software development from natural language requirements. However, existing approaches largely adopt linear, waterfall-style pipelines, which oversimplify the iterative nature of real-world development and struggle with complex, large-scale projects. To address these limitations, we propose EvoDev, an iterative software development framework inspired by feature-driven development. EvoDev decomposes user requirements into a set of user-valued features and constructs a Feature Map, a directed acyclic graph that explicitly models dependencies between features. Each node in the feature map maintains multi-level information, including business logic, design, and code, which is propagated along dependencies to provide context for subsequent development iterations. We evaluate EvoDev on challenging Android development tasks and show that it outperforms the best-performing baseline, Claude Code, by a substantial margin of 56.8%, while improving single-agent performance by 16.0%-76.6% across different base LLMs, highlighting the importance of dependency modeling, context propagation, and workflow-aware agent design for complex software projects. Our work summarizes practical insights for designing iterative, LLM-driven development frameworks and informs future training of base LLMs to better support iterative software development.

The agent fuses (i) a semantically segmented 3-D environment, (ii) live application metadata, and (iii) users' verbal, pointing, and head-gaze cues to issue JSON window-placement actions. As a result, users can manage a panoramic workspace through: (1) explicit commands ("Place Google Maps on the coffee table"), (2) deictic speech plus gestures ("Put that there"), or (3) high-level goals ("I need to send a message"). Unlike traditional explicit interfaces, our system supports one-to-many action mappings and goal-centric reasoning, allowing the LLM to dynamically infer relevant applications and layout decisions, including interrelationships across tools. This enables seamless, intent-driven interaction without manual window juggling in immersive XR environments.

      We propose FlowRL: matching the full reward distribution via flow balancing instead of maximizing rewards in large language model (LLM) reinforcement learning (RL). Recent advanced reasoning models adopt reward-maximizing methods (\eg, PPO and GRPO), which tend to over-optimize dominant reward signals while neglecting less frequent but valid reasoning paths, thus reducing diversity. In contrast, we transform scalar rewards into a normalized target distribution using a learnable partition function, and then minimize the reverse KL divergence between the policy and the target distribution. We implement this idea as a flow-balanced optimization method that promotes diverse exploration and generalizable reasoning trajectories. We conduct experiments on math and code reasoning tasks: FlowRL achieves a significant average improvement of $10.0\%$ over GRPO and $5.1\%$ over PPO on math benchmarks, and performs consistently better on code reasoning tasks. These results highlight reward distribution-matching as a key step toward efficient exploration and diverse reasoning in LLM reinforcement learning.

      The widespread deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) as public-facing web services and APIs has made their security a core concern for the web ecosystem. Jailbreak attacks, as one of the significant threats to LLMs, have recently attracted extensive research. In this paper, we reveal a jailbreak strategy which can effectively evade current defense strategies. It can extract valuable information from failed or partially successful attack attempts and contains self-evolution from attack interactions, resulting in sufficient strategy diversity and adaptability. Inspired by continuous learning and modular design principles, we propose ASTRA, a jailbreak framework that autonomously discovers, retrieves, and evolves attack strategies to achieve more efficient and adaptive attacks. To enable this autonomous evolution, we design a closed-loop "attack-evaluate-distill-reuse" core mechanism that not only generates attack prompts but also automatically distills and generalizes reusable attack strategies from every interaction. To systematically accumulate and apply this attack knowledge, we introduce a three-tier strategy library that categorizes strategies into Effective, Promising, and Ineffective based on their performance scores. The strategy library not only provides precise guidance for attack generation but also possesses exceptional extensibility and transferability. We conduct extensive experiments under a black-box setting, and the results show that ASTRA achieves an average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 82.7%, significantly outperforming baselines.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) trained with reinforcement learning and verifiable rewards have achieved strong results on complex reasoning tasks. Recent work extends this paradigm to a multi-agent setting, where a meta-thinking agent proposes plans and monitors progress while a reasoning agent executes subtasks through sequential conversational turns. Despite promising performance, we identify a critical limitation: lazy agent behavior, in which one agent dominates while the other contributes little, undermining collaboration and collapsing the setup to an ineffective single agent. In this paper, we first provide a theoretical analysis showing why lazy behavior naturally arises in multi-agent reasoning. We then introduce a stable and efficient method for measuring causal influence, helping mitigate this issue. Finally, as collaboration intensifies, the reasoning agent risks getting lost in multi-turn interactions and trapped by previous noisy responses. To counter this, we propose a verifiable reward mechanism that encourages deliberation by allowing the reasoning agent to discard noisy outputs, consolidate instructions, and restart its reasoning process when necessary. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework alleviates lazy agent behavior and unlocks the full potential of multi-agent framework for complex reasoning tasks.

      Recent advances in agent development have focused on scaling model size and raw interaction data, mirroring successes in large language models. However, for complex, long-horizon multi-agent tasks such as robotic soccer, this end-to-end approach often fails due to intractable exploration spaces and sparse rewards. We propose that an effective world model for decision-making must model the world's physics and also its task semantics. A systematic review of 2024 research in low-resource multi-agent soccer reveals a clear trend towards integrating symbolic and hierarchical methods, such as Hierarchical Task Networks (HTNs) and Bayesian Strategy Networks (BSNs), with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). These methods decompose complex goals into manageable subgoals, creating an intrinsic curriculum that shapes agent learning. We formalize this trend into a framework for Hierarchical Task Environments (HTEs), which are essential for bridging the gap between simple, reactive behaviors and sophisticated, strategic team play. Our framework incorporates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as generative world models of tasks, capable of dynamically generating this scaffolding. We argue that HTEs provide a mechanism to guide exploration, generate meaningful learning signals, and train agents to internalize hierarchical structure, enabling the development of more capable and general-purpose agents with greater sample efficiency than purely end-to-end approaches.

      To enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), self-consistency has become a popular approach, combining multiple samplings with majority voting. However, current methods are computationally expensive and time-consuming due to the need for numerous samplings. To address this, this paper introduces path-consistency, which leverages the confidence of earlier-generated answers to identify the most promising prefix and guide the generation of subsequent branches. By dynamically guiding the generation of subsequent branches based on this prefix, path-consistency mitigates both the errors and redundancies from random or less useful sampling in self-consistency. This approach reduces errors and redundancies from random sampling, significantly accelerating inference by minimizing token consumption. Our extensive empirical results demonstrate that path-consistency improves inference latency by up to 40.5\%, while maintaining task accuracy across various tasks, including mathematical reasoning, commonsense reasoning, and symbolic reasoning.

      Formal reasoning and automated theorem proving constitute a challenging subfield of machine learning, in which machines are tasked with proving mathematical theorems using formal languages like Lean. A formal verification system can check whether a formal proof is correct or not almost instantaneously, but generating a completely correct formal proof with large language models (LLMs) remains a formidable task. The usual approach in the literature is to prompt the LLM many times (up to several thousands) until one of the generated proofs passes the verification system. In this work, we present APOLLO (Automated PrOof repair viaLLM and Lean cOllaboration), a modular, model-agnostic agentic framework that combines the strengths of the Lean compiler with an LLM's reasoning abilities to achieve better proof-generation results at a low token and sampling budgets. Apollo directs a fully automated process in which the LLM generates proofs for theorems, a set of agents analyze the proofs, fix the syntax errors, identify the mistakes in the proofs using Lean, isolate failing sub-lemmas, utilize automated solvers, and invoke an LLM on each remaining goal with a low top-K budget. The repaired sub-proofs are recombined and reverified, iterating up to a user-controlled maximum number of attempts. On the miniF2F benchmark, we establish a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 84.9% among sub 8B-parameter models (as of August 2025) while keeping the sampling budget below one hundred. Moreover, Apollo raises the state-of-the-art accuracy for Goedel-Prover-SFT to 65.6% while cutting sample complexity from 25,600 to a few hundred. General-purpose models (o3-mini, o4-mini) jump from 3-7% to over 40% accuracy. Our results demonstrate that targeted, compiler-guided repair of LLM outputs yields dramatic gains in both efficiency and correctness, suggesting a general paradigm for scalable automated theorem proving.

Evaluated on three real-world cohorts (BG, DDD, UDN), LA-MARRVEL consistently improves Recall@K over AI-MARRVEL and established phenotype-driven tools such as Exomiser and LIRICAL, with especially large gains on cases where the first-stage ranker placed the causal gene lower. Each ranked gene is accompanied by LLM-generated reasoning that integrates phenotypic, inheritance, and variant-level evidence, thereby making the output more interpretable and facilitating clinical review.

      Recent research has shown that hallucinations, omissions, and biases are prevalent in everyday use-cases of LLMs. However, chatbots used in medical contexts must provide consistent advice in situations where non-medical factors are involved, such as when demographic information is present. In order to understand the conditions under which medical chatbots fail to perform as expected, we develop an infrastructure that 1) automatically generates queries to probe LLMs and 2) evaluates answers to these queries using multiple LLM-as-a-judge setups and prompts. For 1), our prompt creation pipeline samples the space of patient demographics, histories, disorders, and writing styles to create realistic questions that we subsequently use to prompt LLMs. In 2), our evaluation pipeline provides hallucination and omission detection using LLM-as-a-judge as well as agentic workflows, in addition to LLM-as-a-judge treatment category detectors. As a baseline study, we perform two case studies on inter-LLM agreement and the impact of varying the answering and evaluation LLMs. We find that LLM annotators exhibit low agreement scores (average Cohen's Kappa $\kappa=0.118$), and only specific (answering, evaluation) LLM pairs yield statistically significant differences across writing styles, genders, and races. We recommend that studies using LLM evaluation use multiple LLMs as evaluators in order to avoid arriving at statistically significant but non-generalizable results, particularly in the absence of ground-truth data. We also suggest publishing inter-LLM agreement metrics for transparency. Our code and dataset are available here: https://github.com/BBN-E/medic-neurips-2025-demo.

      Novel research ideas play a critical role in advancing scientific inquiries. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential to generate novel research ideas by leveraging large-scale scientific literature. However, previous work in research ideation has primarily relied on simplistic methods, such as keyword co-occurrence or semantic similarity. These approaches focus on identifying statistical associations in the literature but overlook the complex, contextual relationships between scientific concepts, which are essential to effectively leverage knowledge embedded in human literature. For instance, papers that simultaneously mention "keyword A" and "keyword B" often present research ideas that integrate both concepts. Additionally, some LLM-driven methods propose and refine research ideas using the model's internal knowledge, but they fail to effectively utilize the scientific concept network, limiting the grounding of ideas in established research. To address these challenges, we propose the Deep Ideation framework to address these challenges, integrating a scientific network that captures keyword co-occurrence and contextual relationships, enriching LLM-driven ideation. The framework introduces an explore-expand-evolve workflow to iteratively refine research ideas, using an Idea Stack to track progress. A critic engine, trained on real-world reviewer feedback, guides the process by providing continuous feedback on the novelty and feasibility of ideas. Our experiments show that our approach improves the quality of generated ideas by 10.67% compared to other methods, with ideas surpassing top conference acceptance levels. Human evaluation highlights their practical value in scientific research, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component in the workflow.

      Agentic LLM applications interleave LLM generation requests with tool calls. These tool calls break the continuity of the workflow by creating pauses between LLM requests, bringing many challenges for the serving system, especially under multi-turn scenarios. Each pause potentially causes KV cache eviction and extra waiting time before entering the continuous batch for the following LLM request. Since these pauses happen for each call, this problem becomes increasingly severe as turn number grow for agentic programs. Previous works either fail to incorporate information from the tool call, evicting KV cache that leads to repetitive prefill or loading, or ignore the continuity of a multi-turn program, creating waiting time between turns that increases per-request latency. We present Continuum, a serving system to optimize job completion time for multi-turn agent workloads by combining tool-aware KV cache timeout with program-level scheduling. By predicting tool call durations in agentic workflows, Continuum selectively pins the KV cache in GPU memory with a time-to-live value based on total turn number. When combined with program-level first-come-first-serve, Continuum prevents scheduling bubbles, preserves multi-turn continuity, and optimizes for throughput for complex agentic workflows. By modeling the variability of tool call and agent program continuity, Continuum outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Our evaluation on real-world agentic workloads (SWE-Bench and BFCL) with Llama-3.1 8B/70B models shows that Continuum significantly improves the average job completion times, and remains performant across different hardware setups and DRAM offloading schemes.

      With the exponential growth in mobile applications, protecting user privacy has become even more crucial. Android applications are often known for collecting, storing, and sharing sensitive user information such as contacts, location, camera, and microphone data often without the user's clear consent or awareness raising significant privacy risks and exposure. In the context of privacy assessment, dataflow analysis is particularly valuable for identifying data usage and potential leaks. Traditionally, this type of analysis has relied on formal methods, heuristics, and rule-based matching. However, these techniques are often complex to implement and prone to errors, such as taint explosion for large programs. Moreover, most existing Android dataflow analysis methods depend heavily on predefined list of sinks, limiting their flexibility and scalability. To address the limitations of these existing techniques, we propose AndroByte, an AI-driven privacy analysis tool that leverages LLM reasoning on bytecode summarization to dynamically generate accurate and explainable dataflow call graphs from static code analysis. AndroByte achieves a significant F\b{eta}-Score of 89% in generating dynamic dataflow call graphs on the fly, outperforming the effectiveness of traditional tools like FlowDroid and Amandroid in leak detection without relying on predefined propagation rules or sink lists. Moreover, AndroByte's iterative bytecode summarization provides comprehensive and explainable insights into dataflow and leak detection, achieving high, quantifiable scores based on the G-Eval metric.

      Assurance cases allow verifying the correct implementation of certain non-functional requirements of mission-critical systems, including their safety, security, and reliability. They can be used in the specification of autonomous driving, avionics, air traffic control, and similar systems. They aim to reduce risks of harm of all kinds including human mortality, environmental damage, and financial loss. However, assurance cases often tend to be organized as extensive documents spanning hundreds of pages, making their creation, review, and maintenance error-prone, time-consuming, and tedious. Therefore, there is a growing need to leverage (semi-)automated techniques, such as those powered by generative AI and large language models (LLMs), to enhance efficiency, consistency, and accuracy across the entire assurance-case lifecycle. In this paper, we focus on assurance case review, a critical task that ensures the quality of assurance cases and therefore fosters their acceptance by regulatory authorities. We propose a novel approach that leverages the \textit{LLM-as-a-judge} paradigm to automate the review process. Specifically, we propose new predicate-based rules that formalize well-established assurance case review criteria, allowing us to craft LLM prompts tailored to the review task. Our experiments on several state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, DeepSeek-R1, and Gemini 2.0 Flash) show that, while most LLMs yield relatively good review capabilities, DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-4.1 demonstrate superior performance, with DeepSeek-R1 ultimately outperforming GPT-4.1. However, our experimental results also suggest that human reviewers are still needed to refine the reviews LLMs yield.

      With the widespread application of large language models (LLMs) in the field of code intelligence, increasing attention has been paid to the reliability and controllability of their outputs in code reasoning tasks. Confidence estimation serves as an effective and convenient approach for evaluating these aspects. This paper proposes a confidence analysis and enhancement framework for LLMs tailored to code reasoning tasks. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study on the confidence reliability of mainstream LLMs across different tasks, and further evaluate the effectiveness of techniques such as prompt strategy optimisation and mathematical calibration (e.g., Platt Scaling) in improving confidence reliability. Our results show that DeepSeek-Reasoner achieves the best performance across various tasks, outperforming other models by up to $0.680$, $0.636$, and $13.652$ in terms of ECE, Brier Score, and Performance Score, respectively. The hybrid strategy combining the reassess prompt strategy and Platt Scaling achieves improvements of up to $0.541$, $0.628$, and $15.084$ over the original performance in the aforementioned three metrics. These results indicate that models with reasoning capabilities demonstrate superior confidence reliability, and that the hybrid strategy is the most effective in enhancing the confidence reliability of various models. Meanwhile, we elucidate the impact of different task complexities, model scales, and strategies on confidence performance, and highlight that the confidence of current LLMs in complex reasoning tasks still has considerable room for improvement. This study not only provides a research foundation and technical reference for the application of confidence in LLM-assisted software engineering, but also points the way for future optimisation and engineering deployment of confidence mechanisms.

      As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale, their workloads increasingly rely on distributed execution across multiple GPUs. However, the conventional bulk synchronous parallel~(BSP) model used in such settings introduces significant performance inefficiencies. To characterize these bottlenecks, we introduce the ''Three Taxes'' (Bulk Synchronous, Inter-Kernel Data Locality, and Kernel Launch Overhead) as an analytical framework. We propose moving beyond the rigid BSP model to address key inefficiencies in distributed GPU execution. By exploiting libraries like Iris for Triton, we gain access to in-kernel communication primitives that enable the design of novel fine-grained programming patterns, offering greater flexibility and performance than traditional BSP-based approaches. These patterns systematically eliminate the three taxes by creating direct, tile-level producer-consumer pipelines and replacing global barriers with fine-grained dataflow synchronization. Applying this methodology to critical kernels, from the foundational All-Gather + general matrix multiplication operation to the complex Flash Decode algorithm, we observe a 10-20% speedup in end-to-end latency over BSP-based approaches, establishing a more programmable and efficient paradigm for distributed LLM workloads.

      Open data repositories hold potential for evidence-based decision-making, yet are inaccessible to non-experts lacking expertise in dataset discovery, schema mapping, and statistical analysis. Large language models show promise for individual tasks, but end-to-end analytical workflows expose fundamental limitations: attention dilutes across growing contexts, specialized reasoning patterns interfere, and errors propagate undetected. We present PublicAgent, a multi-agent framework that addresses these limitations through decomposition into specialized agents for intent clarification, dataset discovery, analysis, and reporting. This architecture maintains focused attention within agent contexts and enables validation at each stage. Evaluation across five models and 50 queries derives five design principles for multi-agent LLM systems. First, specialization provides value independent of model strength--even the strongest model shows 97.5% agent win rates, with benefits orthogonal to model scale. Second, agents divide into universal (discovery, analysis) and conditional (report, intent) categories. Universal agents show consistent effectiveness (std dev 12.4%) while conditional agents vary by model (std dev 20.5%). Third, agents mitigate distinct failure modes--removing discovery or analysis causes catastrophic failures (243-280 instances), while removing report or intent causes quality degradation. Fourth, architectural benefits persist across task complexity with stable win rates (86-92% analysis, 84-94% discovery), indicating workflow management value rather than reasoning enhancement. Fifth, wide variance in agent effectiveness across models (42-96% for analysis) requires model-aware architecture design. These principles guide when and why specialization is necessary for complex analytical workflows while enabling broader access to public data through natural language interfaces.

Traditional SAST tools, while effective for proactive security, are limited by high false-positive rates and a lack of contextual understanding. Conversely, LLMs excel at code analysis and pattern recognition but can be prone to inconsistencies and hallucinations. By integrating these two technologies, a more intelligent and efficient system is created. This combination moves beyond mere vulnerability detection optimization, transforming security into a deeply integrated, contextual process that provides tangible benefits like improved triage, dynamic bug descriptions, bug validation via exploit generation and enhanced analysis of complex codebases. The result is a more effective security approach that leverages the strengths of both technologies while mitigating their weaknesses.

      The growing gap between the increasing complexity of large language models (LLMs) and the limited computational budgets of edge devices poses a key challenge for efficient on-device inference, despite gradual improvements in hardware capabilities. Existing strategies, such as aggressive quantization, pruning, or remote inference, trade accuracy for efficiency or lead to substantial cost burdens. This position paper introduces a new framework that leverages speculative decoding, previously viewed primarily as a decoding acceleration technique for autoregressive generation of LLMs, as a promising approach specifically adapted for edge computing by orchestrating computation across heterogeneous devices. We propose \acronym, a framework that allows lightweight edge devices to draft multiple candidate tokens locally using diverse draft models, while a single, shared edge server verifies the tokens utilizing a more precise target model. To further increase the efficiency of verification, the edge server batch the diverse verification requests from devices. This approach supports device heterogeneity and reduces server-side memory footprint by sharing the same upstream target model across multiple devices. Our initial experiments with Jetson Orin Nano, Raspberry Pi 4B/5, and an edge server equipped with 4 Nvidia A100 GPUs indicate substantial benefits: 2.2 more system throughput, 2.8 more system capacity, and better cost efficiency, all without sacrificing model accuracy.

      Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on function-level code generation benchmarks, yet real-world software development increasingly demands class-level implementations that integrate multiple methods, attributes, and dependencies within authentic project contexts. This gap between benchmark performance and practical utility raises critical questions about LLMs' readiness for production code assistance, particularly regarding their ability to generalize across familiar and novel codebases. We introduce a benchmark derived from real-world open-source repositories, comprising classes divided into seen and unseen partitions to evaluate generalization under practical conditions. We systematically examine how input specification completeness and retrieval-augmented generation affect class-level correctness across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. Our evaluation reveals a substantial performance gap: while LLMs achieve 84 to 89% correctness on synthetic benchmarks, they attain only 25 to 34% on real-world class tasks, with minimal distinction between familiar and novel codebases. Comprehensive documentation provides marginal improvements (1 to 3%), whereas retrieval augmentation yields greater gains (4 to 7%) by supplying concrete implementation patterns. Error analysis identifies AttributeError, TypeError, and AssertionError as dominant failure modes, with distinct patterns between synthetic and real-world scenarios. These findings provide actionable insights for enhancing context modelling, documentation strategies, and retrieval integration in production code assistance tools.

The framework is structured along two critical axes: Virtual vs. Embodied and Emotional Companionship vs. Functional Augmentation. Quadrant I (Virtual Companionship) explores virtual idols, romantic companions, and story characters, introducing a four-layer technical framework to analyze their challenges in maintaining long-term emotional consistency. Quadrant II (Functional Virtual Assistants) analyzes AI applications in work, gaming, and mental health, highlighting the shift from "feeling" to "thinking and acting" and pinpointing key technologies like enterprise RAG and on-device inference. Quadrants III & IV (Embodied Intelligence) shift from the virtual to the physical world, analyzing home robots and vertical-domain assistants, revealing core challenges in symbol grounding, data privacy, and ethical liability.

In contrast, using only the current turn avoids this overhead but discards essential information. This trade-off limits the scalability of search agents. To address this challenge, we propose MemSearcher, an agent workflow that iteratively maintains a compact memory and combines the current turn with it. At each turn, MemSearcher fuses the user's question with the memory to generate reasoning traces, perform search actions, and update memory to retain only information essential for solving the task. This design stabilizes context length across multi-turn interactions, improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. To optimize this workflow, we introduce multi-context GRPO, an end-to-end RL framework that jointly optimize reasoning, search strategies, and memory management of MemSearcher Agents. Specifically, multi-context GRPO samples groups of trajectories under different contexts and propagates trajectory-level advantages across all conversations within them. Trained on the same dataset as Search-R1, MemSearcher achieves significant improvements over strong baselines on seven public benchmarks: +11% on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and +12% on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct relative average gains. Notably, the 3B-based MemSearcher even outperforms 7B-based baselines, demonstrating that striking a balance between information integrity and efficiency yields both higher accuracy and lower computational overhead.

      We present a systematic study of subtraction in large language models (LLMs). While prior benchmarks emphasize addition and multiplication, subtraction has received comparatively little attention despite being structurally distinct as a non-commutative operation. We evaluate eight pretrained LLMs spanning four families on addition and subtraction problems. Our experiments reveal that subtraction accuracy lags behind addition by a wide margin. We find that the errors for ($a-b$) are concentrated in cases where ($a<b$). In such cases, LLMs frequently produce the correct magnitude but omit the negative sign. Probing analyses show that LLMs internally encode whether results should be negative, yet this information is often not reflected in generated outputs. We further test well-known techniques such as few-shot learning and instruction-tuning to see if they can improve the LLMs' performance. Our results suggest that while few-shot prompting yields modest gains, the instruction-tuned models achieve near-perfect accuracies in generating the negative sign. Together, these findings provide a clearer characterization of the limitations and recoverability of LLMs' arithmetic capabilities in subtraction.

      The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) often need to be tailored for specific applications, requiring the integration of new knowledge or the acquisition of new skills. While full fine-tuning is a powerful adaptation method, it is computationally expensive and can lead to a degradation of general reasoning abilities, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. A range of alternative techniques exists, each with its own trade-offs. In-Context Learning (ICL) is fast but limited by context length, while Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) offer a middle ground by minimizing parameter changes. However, the challenge of catastrophic forgetting persists, raising questions about the best adaptation strategy for a given task. This paper presents a comparative analysis of Supervised Finetuning (SFT), LoRA, and ICL in data-scarce scenarios. We find that LoRA provides the most effective balance, successfully instilling new skills with minimal impact on the base model's general knowledge. In contrast, while SFT excels at skill acquisition, it is highly susceptible to catastrophic forgetting. ICL is effective for incorporating factual knowledge but struggles with complex skills. Our findings offer a practical framework for selecting an LLM adaptation strategy. We highlight the critical distinction between skill acquisition and knowledge integration, clarify the trade-offs between task-specific performance and the preservation of general capabilities.

      Large language models (LLMs) exhibit complementary strengths across domains and come with varying inference costs, motivating the design of multi-agent LLM systems where specialized models collaborate efficiently. Existing approaches predominantly rely on decentralized frameworks, which invoke multiple LLMs for every input and thus lead to substantial and uncontrolled inference costs. In this work, we introduce a centralized multi-LLM framework, where a controller LLM selectively coordinates a pool of expert models in a cost-efficient and cost-controllable manner. We formulate this coordination problem as reinforcement learning with dual objectives: maximizing task performance while minimizing the overall inference cost. In addition, we expect the multi-agent system to have adapted behavior with different budget conditions during inference. To this end, we propose CoRL, a reinforcement learning framework that optimizes the performance cost trade-off in a controllable multi-budget setting. Experiments on four diverse benchmarks demonstrate that CoRL enables a single system to surpass the best expert LLM under high-budget settings, while maintaining strong performance in more economical low-budget modes, highlighting the effectiveness of centralized coordination for scalable and cost-efficient multi-agent LLM systems.

      Current evaluations of Large Language Model (LLM) agents primarily emphasize task completion, often overlooking resource efficiency and adaptability. This neglects a crucial capability: agents' ability to devise and adjust cost-optimal plans in response to changing environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce CostBench, a scalable, cost-centric benchmark designed to evaluate agents' economic reasoning and replanning abilities. Situated in the travel-planning domain, CostBench comprises tasks solvable via multiple sequences of atomic and composite tools with diverse, customizable costs. It also supports four types of dynamic blocking events, such as tool failures and cost changes, to simulate real-world unpredictability and necessitate agents to adapt in real time. Evaluating leading open-sourced and proprietary models on CostBench reveals a substantial gap in cost-aware planning: agents frequently fail to identify cost-optimal solutions in static settings, with even GPT-5 achieving less than 75% exact match rate on the hardest tasks, and performance further dropping by around 40% under dynamic conditions. By diagnosing these weaknesses, CostBench lays the groundwork for developing future agents that are both economically rational and robust.

      Recent advances in LLM Multi-Agent Systems enable scalable orchestration of sub-agents, each coordinating hundreds or thousands of tools or Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. However, existing retrieval methods typically match queries against coarse agent-level descriptions before routing, which obscures fine-grained tool functionality and often results in suboptimal agent selection. We introduce Tool-to-Agent Retrieval, a unified framework that embeds both tools and their parent agents in a shared vector space and connects them through metadata relationships. By explicitly representing tool capabilities and traversing metadata to the agent level, Tool-to-Agent Retrieval enables granular tool-level or agent-level retrieval, ensuring that agents and their underlying tools or MCP servers are equally represented without the context dilution that arises from chunking many tools together. Evaluating Tool-to-Agent Retrieval across eight embedding models, our approach achieves consistent improvements of 19.4% in Recall@5 and 17.7% in nDCG@5 over previous state-of-the-art agent retrievers on the LiveMCPBench benchmark.

(i) Up-to-date Bilingual Corpus: We construct an extensive, up-to-date policy corpus that significantly scales the effective assessment sample size, ensuring relevance to current governance practice. (ii) Scenario-Grounded Task Design: We distill three specialized, scenario-grounded tasks -- Clause Retrieval & Interpretation, Solution Generation, and the Compliance Judgmen--to comprehensively probe model understanding and application. (iii) Dual-Metric Evaluation Framework: We establish a novel dual-metric evaluation framework combining semantic similarity with accuracy rate to precisely measure both content alignment and task requirement adherence. A large-scale evaluation of over 10 state-of-the-art LLMs on POLIS-Bench reveals a clear performance hierarchy where reasoning models maintain superior cross-task stability and accuracy, highlighting the difficulty of compliance tasks. Furthermore, leveraging our benchmark, we successfully fine-tune a lightweight open-source model. The resulting POLIS series models achieves parity with, or surpasses, strong proprietary baselines on multiple policy subtasks at a significantly reduced cost, providing a cost-effective and compliant path for robust real-world governmental deployment.

      We introduce a novel framework that transforms the resource-intensive (adversarial) prompt optimization problem into an \emph{efficient, amortized inference task}. Our core insight is that pretrained, non-autoregressive generative LLMs, such as Diffusion LLMs, which model the joint distribution over prompt-response pairs, can serve as powerful surrogates for prompt search. This approach enables the direct conditional generation of prompts, effectively replacing costly, per-instance discrete optimization with a small number of parallelizable samples. We provide a probabilistic analysis demonstrating that under mild fidelity assumptions, only a few conditional samples are required to recover high-reward (harmful) prompts. Empirically, we find that the generated prompts are low-perplexity, diverse jailbreaks that exhibit strong transferability to a wide range of black-box target models, including robustly trained and proprietary LLMs. Beyond adversarial prompting, our framework opens new directions for red teaming, automated prompt optimization, and leveraging emerging Flow- and Diffusion-based LLMs.

      The generate-filter-refine (iterative paradigm) based on large language models (LLMs) has achieved progress in reasoning, programming, and program discovery in AI+Science. However, the effectiveness of search depends on where to search, namely, how to encode the domain prior into an operationally structured hypothesis space. To this end, this paper proposes a compact formal theory that describes and measures LLM-assisted iterative search guided by domain priors. We represent an agent as a fuzzy relation operator on inputs and outputs to capture feasible transitions; the agent is thereby constrained by a fixed safety envelope. To describe multi-step reasoning/search, we weight all reachable paths by a single continuation parameter and sum them to obtain a coverage generating function; this induces a measure of reachability difficulty; and it provides a geometric interpretation of search on the graph induced by the safety envelope. We further provide the simplest testable inferences and validate them via two instantiation. This theory offers a workable language and operational tools to measure agents and their search spaces, proposing a systematic formal description of iterative search constructed by LLMs.

      Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in solving recommendation tasks. With proven capabilities in understanding user preferences, LLM personalization has emerged as a critical area for providing tailored responses to individuals. Current studies explore personalization through prompt design and fine-tuning, paving the way for further research in personalized LLMs. However, existing approaches are either costly and inefficient in capturing diverse user preferences or fail to account for timely updates to user history. To address these gaps, we propose the Memory-Assisted Personalized LLM (MAP). Through user interactions, we first create a history profile for each user, capturing their preferences, such as ratings for historical items. During recommendation, we extract relevant memory based on similarity, which is then incorporated into the prompts to enhance personalized recommendations. In our experiments, we define a new task that enables testing with varying memory size under two scenarios: single domain where memory and tasks are from the same category and cross-domain (e.g. memory from movies and recommendation tasks in books). The results show that MAP outperforms regular LLM-based recommenders that integrate user history directly through prompt design. Moreover, as user history grows, MAP's advantage increases in both scenarios, making it more suitable for addressing successive personalized user requests.

However, it still faces two critical challenges: (1) representation overlap within the medical knowledge space often causes inaccurate retrieval and reduces editing accuracy; (2) existing methods are restricted to single-sample edits, while batch-editing remains largely unexplored despite its importance for real-world medical applications.

      The reasoning capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs), such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have seen substantial advancements through deep thinking. However, these enhancements come with significant resource demands, underscoring the need for training effective small reasoning models. A critical challenge is that small models possess different reasoning capacities and cognitive trajectories compared with their larger counterparts. Hence, directly distilling chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales from large LRMs to smaller ones can sometimes be ineffective and often requires a substantial amount of annotated data. In this paper, we first introduce a novel Critique-Rethink-Verify (CRV) system, designed for training smaller yet powerful LRMs. Our CRV system consists of multiple LLM agents, each specializing in unique tasks: (i) critiquing the CoT rationales according to the cognitive capabilities of smaller models, (ii) rethinking and refining these CoTs based on the critiques, and (iii) verifying the correctness of the refined results. Building on the CRV system, we further propose the Cognitive Preference Optimization (CogPO) algorithm to continuously enhance the reasoning abilities of smaller models by aligning their reasoning processes with their cognitive capacities. Comprehensive evaluations on challenging reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our CRV+CogPO framework, which outperforms other methods by a large margin.

While existing INT4/INT8 quantization reduces these costs, they often degrade accuracy or lack optimal efficiency. INT6 quantization offers a superior trade-off between model accuracy and inference efficiency, but lacks hardware support in modern GPUs, forcing emulation via higher-precision arithmetic units that limit acceleration. In this paper, we propose FlexQ, a novel post-training INT6 quantization framework combining algorithmic innovation with system-level optimizations. FlexQ employs uniform 6-bit weight quantization across all layers, with adaptive retention of 8-bit activations in layers identified through layer-wise sensitivity analysis. To maximize hardware efficiency, we develop a specialized high-performance GPU kernel supporting matrix multiplication for W6A6 and W6A8 representations via Binary Tensor Core (BTC) equivalents, effectively bypassing the lack of native INT6 tensor cores. Evaluations on LLaMA family models show FlexQ maintains near-FP16 accuracy, with perplexity increases of no more than 0.1 on WikiText2. The proposed kernel achieves an average 1.39$\times$ speedup over ABQ-LLM on LLaMA-2-70B linear layers.

This study proposes and tests methods for probing, quantifying, and modifying an LLM's internal representations in a Dictator Game -- a classic behavioral experiment on fairness and prosocial behavior.

Manipulating these vectors during the model's inference can substantially alter how those variables relate to the model's decision-making. This approach offers a principled way to study and regulate how social concepts can be encoded and engineered within transformer-based models, with implications for alignment, debiasing, and designing AI agents for social simulations in both academic and commercial applications, strengthening sociological theory and measurement.

We introduce the threat of watermark spoofing, a sophisticated attack that allows a malicious model to generate text containing the authentic-looking watermark of a trusted, victim model. This enables the seamless misattribution of harmful content, such as disinformation, to reputable sources. The key to our attack is repurposing watermark radioactivity, the unintended inheritance of data patterns during fine-tuning, from a discoverable trait into an attack vector. By distilling knowledge from a watermarked teacher model, our framework allows an attacker to steal and replicate the watermarking signal of the victim model.

Traditional auditing methods, while essential, struggle to keep pace with the increasing complexity and scale of smart contracts. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for automating vulnerability detection, but their adoption is often limited by high computational costs. Although prior work has explored leveraging large models through agents or workflows, relatively little attention has been given to improving the performance of smaller, fine-tuned models--a critical factor for achieving both efficiency and data privacy. In this paper, we introduce HKT-SmartAudit, a framework for developing lightweight models optimized for smart contract auditing. It features a multi-stage knowledge distillation pipeline that integrates classical distillation, external domain knowledge, and reward-guided learning to transfer high-quality insights from large teacher models. A single-task learning strategy is employed to train compact student models that maintain high accuracy and robustness while significantly reducing computational overhead. Experimental results show that our distilled models outperform both commercial tools and larger models in detecting complex vulnerabilities and logical flaws, offering a practical, secure, and scalable solution for smart contract auditing.

To this end, we present DiscoTrack, an LLM benchmark target- ing a range of tasks across 12 languages and four levels of discourse understanding: salience recognition, entity tracking, discourse relations and bridging inference. Our evaluation shows that these tasks remain challenging, even for state-of-the-art models.

      While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning and planning abilities in textual domains and can effectively follow instructions for complex tasks, their ability to understand and manipulate spatial relationships remains limited. Such capabilities are crucial for content-aware graphic layout design, where the goal is to arrange heterogeneous elements onto a canvas so that final design remains visually balanced and structurally feasible. This problem requires precise coordination of placement, alignment, and structural organization of multiple elements within a constrained visual space. To address this limitation, we introduce LaySPA, a reinforcement learning-based framework that augments LLM-based agents with explicit spatial reasoning capabilities for layout design. LaySPA employs hybrid reward signals that jointly capture geometric constraints, structural fidelity, and visual quality, enabling agents to navigate the canvas, model inter-element relationships, and optimize spatial arrangements. Through group-relative policy optimization, the agent generates content-aware layouts that reflect salient regions, respect spatial constraints, and produces an interpretable reasoning trace explaining placement decisions and a structured layout specification. Experimental results show that LaySPA substantially improves the generation of structurally valid and visually appealing layouts, outperforming larger general-purpose LLMs and achieving performance comparable to state-of-the-art specialized layout models.

      The performance of large language models (LLMs) depends on how they are prompted, with choices spanning both the high-level prompting pattern (e.g., Zero-Shot, CoT, ReAct, ReWOO) and the specific prompt content (instructions and few-shot demonstrations). Manually tuning this combination is tedious, error-prone, and specific to a given LLM and task. Therefore, this paper proposes AutoPDL, an automated approach to discovering good LLM agent configurations. Our approach frames this as a structured AutoML problem over a combinatorial space of agentic and non-agentic prompting patterns and demonstrations, using successive halving to efficiently navigate this space. We introduce a library implementing common prompting patterns using the PDL prompt programming language. AutoPDL solutions are human-readable, editable, and executable PDL programs that use this library. This approach also enables source-to-source optimization, allowing human-in-the-loop refinement and reuse. Evaluations across three tasks and seven LLMs (ranging from 3B to 70B parameters) show consistent accuracy gains ($9.21\pm15.46$ percentage points), up to 67.5pp, and reveal that selected prompting strategies vary across models and tasks.
