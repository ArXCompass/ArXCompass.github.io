      Unlimited, or so-called helpful-only language models are trained without safety alignment constraints and never refuse user queries. They are widely used by leading AI companies as internal tools for red teaming and alignment evaluation. For example, if a safety-aligned model produces harmful outputs similar to an unlimited model, this indicates alignment failures that require further attention. Despite their essential role in assessing alignment, such models are not available to the research community. We introduce Jinx, a helpful-only variant of popular open-weight LLMs. Jinx responds to all queries without refusals or safety filtering, while preserving the base model's capabilities in reasoning and instruction following. It provides researchers with an accessible tool for probing alignment failures, evaluating safety boundaries, and systematically studying failure modes in language model safety.

      Group decision-making often suffers from uneven information sharing, hindering decision quality. While large language models (LLMs) have been widely studied as aids for individuals, their potential to support groups of users, potentially as facilitators, is relatively underexplored. We present a pre-registered randomized experiment with 1,475 participants assigned to 281 five-person groups completing a hidden profile task--selecting an optimal city for a hypothetical sporting event--under one of four facilitation conditions: no facilitation, a one-time message prompting information sharing, a human facilitator, or an LLM (GPT-4o) facilitator. We find that LLM facilitation increases information shared within a discussion by raising the minimum level of engagement with the task among group members, and that these gains come at limited cost in terms of participants' attitudes towards the task, their group, or their facilitator. Whether by human or AI, there is no significant effect of facilitation on the final decision outcome, suggesting that even substantial but partial increases in information sharing are insufficient to overcome the hidden profile effect studied. To support further research into how LLM-based interfaces can support the future of collaborative decision making, we release our experimental platform, the Group-AI Interaction Laboratory (GRAIL), as an open-source tool.

      Evaluating the safety alignment of LLM responses in high-risk mental health dialogues is particularly difficult due to missing gold-standard answers and the ethically sensitive nature of these interactions. To address this challenge, we propose PsyCrisis-Bench, a reference-free evaluation benchmark based on real-world Chinese mental health dialogues. It evaluates whether the model responses align with the safety principles defined by experts. Specifically designed for settings without standard references, our method adopts a prompt-based LLM-as-Judge approach that conducts in-context evaluation using expert-defined reasoning chains grounded in psychological intervention principles. We employ binary point-wise scoring across multiple safety dimensions to enhance the explainability and traceability of the evaluation. Additionally, we present a manually curated, high-quality Chinese-language dataset covering self-harm, suicidal ideation, and existential distress, derived from real-world online discourse. Experiments on 3600 judgments show that our method achieves the highest agreement with expert assessments and produces more interpretable evaluation rationales compared to existing approaches. Our dataset and evaluation tool are publicly available to facilitate further research.

      Reinforcement learning for LLM reasoning has rapidly emerged as a prominent research area, marked by a significant surge in related studies on both algorithmic innovations and practical applications. Despite this progress, several critical challenges remain, including the absence of standardized guidelines for employing RL techniques and a fragmented understanding of their underlying mechanisms. Additionally, inconsistent experimental settings, variations in training data, and differences in model initialization have led to conflicting conclusions, obscuring the key characteristics of these techniques and creating confusion among practitioners when selecting appropriate techniques. This paper systematically reviews widely adopted RL techniques through rigorous reproductions and isolated evaluations within a unified open-source framework. We analyze the internal mechanisms, applicable scenarios, and core principles of each technique through fine-grained experiments, including datasets of varying difficulty, model sizes, and architectures. Based on these insights, we present clear guidelines for selecting RL techniques tailored to specific setups, and provide a reliable roadmap for practitioners navigating the RL for the LLM domain. Finally, we reveal that a minimalist combination of two techniques can unlock the learning capability of critic-free policies using vanilla PPO loss. The results demonstrate that our simple combination consistently improves performance, surpassing strategies like GRPO and DAPO.

      As large language models become increasingly capable at various writing tasks, their weakness at generating unique and creative content becomes a major liability. Although LLMs have the ability to generate text covering diverse topics, there is an overall sense of repetitiveness across texts that we aim to formalize and quantify via a similarity metric. The familiarity between documents arises from the persistence of underlying discourse structures. However, existing similarity metrics dependent on lexical overlap and syntactic patterns largely capture $\textit{content}$ overlap, thus making them unsuitable for detecting $\textit{structural}$ similarities. We introduce an abstraction based on linguistic theories in Questions Under Discussion (QUD) and question semantics to help quantify differences in discourse progression. We then use this framework to build $\textbf{QUDsim}$, a similarity metric that can detect discursive parallels between documents. Using QUDsim, we find that LLMs often reuse discourse structures (more so than humans) across samples, even when content differs. Furthermore, LLMs are not only repetitive and structurally uniform, but are also divergent from human authors in the types of structures they use.

      Watermarking LLM-generated text is critical for content attribution and misinformation prevention. However, existing methods compromise text quality, require white-box model access and logit manipulation. These limitations exclude API-based models and multilingual scenarios. We propose SAEMark, a general framework for post-hoc multi-bit watermarking that embeds personalized messages solely via inference-time, feature-based rejection sampling without altering model logits or requiring training. Our approach operates on deterministic features extracted from generated text, selecting outputs whose feature statistics align with key-derived targets. This framework naturally generalizes across languages and domains while preserving text quality through sampling LLM outputs instead of modifying. We provide theoretical guarantees relating watermark success probability and compute budget that hold for any suitable feature extractor. Empirically, we demonstrate the framework's effectiveness using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), achieving superior detection accuracy and text quality. Experiments across 4 datasets show SAEMark's consistent performance, with 99.7% F1 on English and strong multi-bit detection accuracy. SAEMark establishes a new paradigm for scalable watermarking that works out-of-the-box with closed-source LLMs while enabling content attribution.

      Large language models (LLMs) have transformed the way we access information. These models are often tuned to refuse to comply with requests that are considered harmful and to produce responses that better align with the preferences of those who control the models. To understand how this "censorship" works. We use representation engineering techniques to study open-weights safety-tuned models. We present a method for finding a refusal--compliance vector that detects and controls the level of censorship in model outputs. We also analyze recent reasoning LLMs, distilled from DeepSeek-R1, and uncover an additional dimension of censorship through "thought suppression". We show a similar approach can be used to find a vector that suppresses the model's reasoning process, allowing us to remove censorship by applying the negative multiples of this vector.

      Post-training is essential for the success of large language models (LLMs), transforming pre-trained base models into more useful and aligned post-trained models. While plenty of works have studied post-training algorithms and evaluated post-training models by their outputs, it remains understudied how post-training reshapes LLMs internally. In this paper, we compare base and post-trained LLMs mechanistically from four perspectives to better understand post-training effects. Our findings across model families and datasets reveal that: (1) Post-training does not change the factual knowledge storage locations, and it adapts knowledge representations from the base model while developing new knowledge representations; (2) Both truthfulness and refusal can be represented by vectors in the hidden representation space. The truthfulness direction is highly similar between the base and post-trained model, and it is effectively transferable for interventions; (3) The refusal direction is different between the base and post-trained models, and it shows limited forward transferability; (4) Differences in confidence between the base and post-trained models cannot be attributed to entropy neurons. Our study provides insights into the fundamental mechanisms preserved and altered during post-training, facilitates downstream tasks like model steering, and could potentially benefit future research in interpretability and LLM post-training.

      Python has become the dominant language for general-purpose programming, yet it lacks robust tools for formal verification. In contrast, programmers working in languages such as C benefit from mature model checkers, for example CBMC, which enable exhaustive symbolic reasoning and fault localisation. The inherent complexity of Python, coupled with the verbosity and low-level nature of existing transpilers (e.g., Cython), have historically limited the applicability of formal verification to Python programs. In this paper, we propose PyVeritas, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for high-level transpilation from Python to C, followed by bounded model checking and MaxSAT-based fault localisation in the generated C code. PyVeritas enables verification and bug localisation for Python code using existing model checking tools for C. Our empirical evaluation on two Python benchmarks demonstrates that LLM-based transpilation can achieve a high degree of accuracy, up to 80--90% for some LLMs, enabling effective development environment that supports assertion-based verification and interpretable fault diagnosis for small yet non-trivial Python programs.

      Evaluating AI agents within complex, interactive environments that mirror real-world challenges is critical for understanding their practical capabilities. While existing agent benchmarks effectively assess skills like tool use or performance on structured tasks, they often do not fully capture an agent's ability to operate autonomously in exploratory environments that demand sustained, self-directed reasoning over a long and growing context. To spur the development of agents capable of more robust intrinsic reasoning over long horizons, we introduce TextQuests, a benchmark based on the Infocom suite of interactive fiction games. These text-based adventures, which can take human players over 30 hours and require hundreds of precise actions to solve, serve as an effective proxy for evaluating AI agents on focused, stateful tasks. The benchmark is specifically designed to assess an LLM agent's capacity for self-contained problem-solving by precluding the use of external tools, thereby focusing on intrinsic long-context reasoning capabilities in an exploratory environment characterized by the need for trial-and-error learning and sustained problem-solving within a single interactive session. We release TextQuests at https://textquests.ai.

      This paper introduces a novel Large Language Models (LLMs)-assisted agent that automatically converts natural-language descriptions of power system optimization scenarios into compact, solver-ready formulations and generates corresponding solutions. In contrast to approaches that rely solely on LLM to produce solutions directly, the proposed method focuses on discovering a mathematically compatible formulation that can be efficiently solved by off-the-shelf optimization solvers. Directly using LLMs to produce solutions often leads to infeasible or suboptimal results, as these models lack the numerical precision and constraint-handling capabilities of established optimization solvers. The pipeline integrates a domain-aware prompt and schema with an LLM, enforces feasibility through systematic validation and iterative repair, and returns both solver-ready models and user-facing results. Using the unit commitment problem as a representative case study, the agent produces optimal or near-optimal schedules along with the associated objective costs. Results demonstrate that coupling the solver with task-specific validation significantly enhances solution reliability. This work shows that combining AI with established optimization frameworks bridges high-level problem descriptions and executable mathematical models, enabling more efficient decision-making in energy systems

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to generating fluent but incorrect content, known as confabulation, which poses increasing risks in multi-turn or agentic applications where outputs may be reused as context. In this work, we investigate how in-context information influences model behavior and whether LLMs can identify their unreliable responses. We propose a reliability estimation that leverages token-level uncertainty to guide the aggregation of internal model representations. Specifically, we compute aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty from output logits to identify salient tokens and aggregate their hidden states into compact representations for response-level reliability prediction. Through controlled experiments on open QA benchmarks, we find that correct in-context information improves both answer accuracy and model confidence, while misleading context often induces confidently incorrect responses, revealing a misalignment between uncertainty and correctness. Our probing-based method captures these shifts in model behavior and improves the detection of unreliable outputs across multiple open-source LLMs. These results underscore the limitations of direct uncertainty signals and highlight the potential of uncertainty-guided probing for reliability-aware generation.

      The security of LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) is critically threatened by propagation vulnerability, where malicious agents can distort collective decision-making through inter-agent message interactions. While existing supervised defense methods demonstrate promising performance, they may be impractical in real-world scenarios due to their heavy reliance on labeled malicious agents to train a supervised malicious detection model. To enable practical and generalizable MAS defenses, in this paper, we propose BlindGuard, an unsupervised defense method that learns without requiring any attack-specific labels or prior knowledge of malicious behaviors. To this end, we establish a hierarchical agent encoder to capture individual, neighborhood, and global interaction patterns of each agent, providing a comprehensive understanding for malicious agent detection. Meanwhile, we design a corruption-guided detector that consists of directional noise injection and contrastive learning, allowing effective detection model training solely on normal agent behaviors. Extensive experiments show that BlindGuard effectively detects diverse attack types (i.e., prompt injection, memory poisoning, and tool attack) across MAS with various communication patterns while maintaining superior generalizability compared to supervised baselines.

      Indoor navigation remains a complex challenge due to the absence of reliable GPS signals and the architectural intricacies of large enclosed environments. This study presents an indoor localization and navigation approach that integrates vision-based localization with large language model (LLM)-based navigation. The localization system utilizes a ResNet-50 convolutional neural network fine-tuned through a two-stage process to identify the user's position using smartphone camera input. To complement localization, the navigation module employs an LLM, guided by a carefully crafted system prompt, to interpret preprocessed floor plan images and generate step-by-step directions. Experimental evaluation was conducted in a realistic office corridor with repetitive features and limited visibility to test localization robustness. The model achieved high confidence and an accuracy of 96% across all tested waypoints, even under constrained viewing conditions and short-duration queries. Navigation tests using ChatGPT on real building floor maps yielded an average instruction accuracy of 75%, with observed limitations in zero-shot reasoning and inference time. This research demonstrates the potential for scalable, infrastructure-free indoor navigation using off-the-shelf cameras and publicly available floor plans, particularly in resource-constrained settings like hospitals, airports, and educational institutions.

      We present TeamMedAgents, a novel multi-agent approach that systematically integrates evidence-based teamwork components from human-human collaboration into medical decision-making with large language models (LLMs). Our approach validates an organizational psychology teamwork model from human collaboration to computational multi-agent medical systems by operationalizing six core teamwork components derived from Salas et al.'s "Big Five" model: team leadership, mutual performance monitoring, team orientation, shared mental models, closed-loop communication, and mutual trust. We implement and evaluate these components as modular, configurable mechanisms within an adaptive collaboration architecture while assessing the effect of the number of agents involved based on the task's requirements and domain. Systematic evaluation of computational implementations of teamwork behaviors across eight medical benchmarks (MedQA, MedMCQA, MMLU-Pro Medical, PubMedQA, DDXPlus, MedBullets, Path-VQA, and PMC-VQA) demonstrates consistent improvements across 7 out of 8 evaluated datasets. Controlled ablation studies conducted on 50 questions per configuration across 3 independent runs provide mechanistic insights into individual component contributions, revealing optimal teamwork configurations that vary by reasoning task complexity and domain-specific requirements. Our ablation analyses reveal dataset-specific optimal teamwork configurations, indicating that different medical reasoning modalities benefit from distinct collaborative patterns. TeamMedAgents represents an advancement in collaborative AI by providing a systematic translation of established teamwork theories from human collaboration into agentic collaboration, establishing a foundation for evidence-based multi-agent system design in critical decision-making domains.

      Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their increased accessibility have made it easier than ever for students to automatically generate texts, posing new challenges for educational institutions. To enforce norms of academic integrity and ensure students' learning, learning analytics methods to automatically detect LLM-generated text appear increasingly appealing. This paper benchmarks the performance of different state-of-the-art detectors in educational contexts, introducing a novel dataset, called Generative Essay Detection in Education (GEDE), containing over 900 student-written essays and over 12,500 LLM-generated essays from various domains. To capture the diversity of LLM usage practices in generating text, we propose the concept of contribution levels, representing students' contribution to a given assignment. These levels range from purely human-written texts, to slightly LLM-improved versions, to fully LLM-generated texts, and finally to active attacks on the detector by "humanizing" generated texts. We show that most detectors struggle to accurately classify texts of intermediate student contribution levels, like LLM-improved human-written texts. Detectors are particularly likely to produce false positives, which is problematic in educational settings where false suspicions can severely impact students' lives.

      The introduction of 5G and the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture has enabled more flexible and intelligent network deployments. However, the increased complexity and openness of these architectures also introduce novel security challenges, such as data manipulation attacks on the semi-standardised Shared Data Layer (SDL) within the O-RAN platform through malicious xApps. In particular, malicious xApps can exploit this vulnerability by introducing subtle Unicode-wise alterations (hypoglyphs) into the data that are being used by traditional machine learning (ML)-based anomaly detection methods. These Unicode-wise manipulations can potentially bypass detection and cause failures in anomaly detection systems based on traditional ML, such as AutoEncoders, which are unable to process hypoglyphed data without crashing. We investigate the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for anomaly detection within the O-RAN architecture to address this challenge. We demonstrate that LLM-based xApps maintain robust operational performance and are capable of processing manipulated messages without crashing. While initial detection accuracy requires further improvements, our results highlight the robustness of LLMs to adversarial attacks such as hypoglyphs in input data. There is potential to use their adaptability through prompt engineering to further improve the accuracy, although this requires further research. Additionally, we show that LLMs achieve low detection latency (under 0.07 seconds), making them suitable for Near-Real-Time (Near-RT) RIC deployments.

      "Fedspeak", the stylized and often nuanced language used by the U.S. Federal Reserve, encodes implicit policy signals and strategic stances. The Federal Open Market Committee strategically employs Fedspeak as a communication tool to shape market expectations and influence both domestic and global economic conditions. As such, automatically parsing and interpreting Fedspeak presents a high-impact challenge, with significant implications for financial forecasting, algorithmic trading, and data-driven policy analysis. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based, uncertainty-aware framework for deciphering Fedspeak and classifying its underlying monetary policy stance. Technically, to enrich the semantic and contextual representation of Fedspeak texts, we incorporate domain-specific reasoning grounded in the monetary policy transmission mechanism. We further introduce a dynamic uncertainty decoding module to assess the confidence of model predictions, thereby enhancing both classification accuracy and model reliability. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the policy stance analysis task. Moreover, statistical analysis reveals a significant positive correlation between perceptual uncertainty and model error rates, validating the effectiveness of perceptual uncertainty as a diagnostic signal.

      Personalizing language models by effectively incorporating user interaction history remains a central challenge in the development of adaptive AI systems. While large language models (LLMs) combined with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have improved factual accuracy, they often lack structured memory and fail to scale in complex, long-term interactions. To address this, we propose a flexible external memory framework based on knowledge graphs, automatically constructed and updated by the LLM itself, and capable of encoding information in multiple formats-including nodes, triplets, higher-order propositions, and episodic traces. Building upon the AriGraph architecture, we introduce a novel hybrid graph design that supports both standard edges and two types of hyperedges, enabling rich and dynamic semantic and temporal representations. Our framework also supports diverse retrieval mechanisms, including A*, water-circle propagation, beam search, and hybrid methods, making it adaptable to different datasets and LLM capacities. We evaluate our system on three benchmarks-TriviaQA, HotpotQA, and DiaASQ-demonstrating that different memory and retrieval configurations yield optimal performance depending on the task. Additionally, we extend the DiaASQ benchmark with temporal annotations and internally contradictory statements, showing that our system remains robust and effective in managing temporal dependencies and context-aware reasoning.

      Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a challenging task that aims to generate spoken language sentences from sign language videos. In this paper, we introduce a lightweight, modular SLT framework, Spotter+GPT, that leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and avoids heavy end-to-end training. Spotter+GPT breaks down the SLT task into two distinct stages. First, a sign spotter identifies individual signs within the input video. The spotted signs are then passed to an LLM, which transforms them into meaningful spoken language sentences. Spotter+GPT eliminates the requirement for SLT-specific training. This significantly reduces computational costs and time requirements. The source code and pretrained weights of the Spotter are available at https://gitlab.surrey.ac.uk/cogvispublic/sign-spotter.

      Large Language Model (LLM) agentic systems are software systems powered by LLMs that autonomously reason, plan, and execute multi-step workflows to achieve human goals, rather than merely executing predefined steps. During execution, these workflows frequently encounter exceptions. Existing exception handling solutions often treat exceptions superficially, failing to trace execution-phase exceptions to their reasoning-phase root causes. Furthermore, their recovery logic is brittle, lacking structured escalation pathways when initial attempts fail. To tackle these challenges, we first present a comprehensive taxonomy of 36 exception types across 12 agent artifacts. Building on this, we propose SHIELDA (Structured Handling of Exceptions in LLM-Driven Agentic Workflows), a modular runtime exception handling framework for LLM agentic workflows. SHIELDA uses an exception classifier to select a predefined exception handling pattern from a handling pattern registry. These patterns are then executed via a structured handling executor, comprising local handling, flow control, and state recovery, to enable phase-aware recovery by linking exceptions to their root causes and facilitating composable strategies. We validate SHIELDA's effectiveness through a case study on the AutoPR agent, demonstrating effective, cross-phase recovery from a reasoning-induced exception.

      Using LLMs in a production environment presents security challenges that include vulnerabilities to jailbreaks and prompt injections, which can result in harmful outputs for humans or the enterprise. The challenge is amplified when working within a specific domain, as topics generally accepted for LLMs to address may be irrelevant to that field. These problems can be mitigated, for example, by fine-tuning large language models with domain-specific and security-focused data. However, these alone are insufficient, as jailbreak techniques evolve. Additionally, API-accessed models do not offer the flexibility needed to tailor behavior to industry-specific objectives, and in-context learning is not always sufficient or reliable. In response to these challenges, we introduce Archias, an expert model adept at distinguishing between in-domain and out-of-domain communications. Archias classifies user inquiries into several categories: in-domain (specifically for the automotive industry), malicious questions, price injections, prompt injections, and out-of-domain examples. Our methodology integrates outputs from the expert model (Archias) into prompts, which are then processed by the LLM to generate responses. This method increases the model's ability to understand the user's intention and give appropriate answers. Archias can be adjusted, fine-tuned, and used for many different purposes due to its small size. Therefore, it can be easily customized to the needs of any industry. To validate our approach, we created a benchmark dataset for the automotive industry. Furthermore, in the interest of advancing research and development, we release our benchmark dataset to the community.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in software engineering research, offering new opportunities for automating repository mining tasks. However, despite their growing popularity, the methodological integration of LLMs into Mining Software Repositories (MSR) remains poorly understood. Existing studies tend to focus on specific capabilities or performance benchmarks, providing limited insight into how researchers utilize LLMs across the full research pipeline. To address this gap, we conduct a mixed-method study that combines a rapid review and questionnaire survey in the field of LLM4MSR. We investigate (1) the approaches and (2) the threats that affect the empirical rigor of researchers involved in this field. Our findings reveal 15 methodological approaches, nine main threats, and 25 mitigation strategies. Building on these findings, we present PRIMES 2.0, a refined empirical framework organized into six stages, comprising 23 methodological substeps, each mapped to specific threats and corresponding mitigation strategies, providing prescriptive and adaptive support throughout the lifecycle of LLM-based MSR studies. Our work contributes to establishing a more transparent and reproducible foundation for LLM-based MSR research.

      This paper introduces an advanced AI-driven perception system for autonomous quadcopter navigation in GPS-denied indoor environments. The proposed framework leverages cloud computing to offload computationally intensive tasks and incorporates a custom-designed printed circuit board (PCB) for efficient sensor data acquisition, enabling robust navigation in confined spaces. The system integrates YOLOv11 for object detection, Depth Anything V2 for monocular depth estimation, a PCB equipped with Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and a cloud-based Large Language Model (LLM) for context-aware decision-making. A virtual safety envelope, enforced by calibrated sensor offsets, ensures collision avoidance, while a multithreaded architecture achieves low-latency processing. Enhanced spatial awareness is facilitated by 3D bounding box estimation with Kalman filtering. Experimental results in an indoor testbed demonstrate strong performance, with object detection achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP50) of 0.6, depth estimation Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 7.2 cm, only 16 safety envelope breaches across 42 trials over approximately 11 minutes, and end-to-end system latency below 1 second. This cloud-supported, high-intelligence framework serves as an auxiliary perception and navigation system, complementing state-of-the-art drone autonomy for GPS-denied confined spaces.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used as automated judges, where practical value depends on both accuracy and trustworthy, risk-aware judgments. Existing approaches predominantly focus on accuracy, overlooking the necessity of well-calibrated confidence, which is vital for adaptive and reliable evaluation pipelines. In this work, we advocate a shift from accuracy-centric evaluation to confidence-driven, risk-aware LLM-as-a-Judge systems, emphasizing the necessity of well-calibrated confidence for trustworthy and adaptive evaluation. We systematically identify the Overconfidence Phenomenon in current LLM-as-a-Judges, where predicted confidence significantly overstates actual correctness, undermining reliability in practical deployment. To quantify this phenomenon, we introduce TH-Score, a novel metric measuring confidence-accuracy alignment. Furthermore, we propose LLM-as-a-Fuser, an ensemble framework that transforms LLMs into reliable, risk-aware evaluators. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially improves calibration and enables adaptive, confidence-driven evaluation pipelines, achieving superior reliability and accuracy compared to existing baselines.

To address this gap, we present an evaluation of 10 legal-specific LLMs on three English language contract understanding tasks and compare them with 7 general-purpose LLMs. The results show that legal-specific LLMs consistently outperform general-purpose models, especially on tasks requiring nuanced legal understanding. Legal-BERT and Contracts-BERT establish new SOTAs on two of the three tasks, despite having 69% fewer parameters than the best-performing general-purpose LLM. We also identify CaseLaw-BERT and LexLM as strong additional baselines for contract understanding. Our results provide a holistic evaluation of legal-specific LLMs and will facilitate the development of more accurate contract understanding systems.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, but struggle with multi-hop reasoning and factual consistency, limiting their effectiveness on knowledge-intensive tasks like complex question answering (QA). Linking Knowledge Graphs (KG) and LLMs has shown promising results, but LLMs generally lack the ability to reason efficiently over graph-structured information. To address this challenge, we introduce DAGR, a retrieval method that leverages both complex questions and their decomposition in subquestions to extract relevant, linked textual subgraphs. DAGR first breaks down complex queries, retrieves subgraphs guided by a weighted similarity function over both the original and decomposed queries, and creates a question-specific knowledge graph to guide answer generation. The resulting Graph-RAG pipeline is suited to handle complex multi-hop questions and effectively reason over graph-structured data. We evaluate DAGR on standard multi-hop QA benchmarks and show that it achieves comparable or superior performance to competitive existing methods, using smaller models and fewer LLM calls.

      Despite the steady progress in machine translation evaluation, existing automatic metrics struggle to capture how well meaning is preserved beyond sentence boundaries. We posit that reliance on a single intrinsic quality score, trained to mimic human judgments, might be insufficient for evaluating translations of long, complex passages, and a more ``pragmatic'' approach that assesses how accurately key information is conveyed by a translation in context is needed. We introduce TREQA (Translation Evaluation via Question-Answering), a framework that extrinsically evaluates translation quality by assessing how accurately candidate translations answer reading comprehension questions that target key information in the original source or reference texts. In challenging domains that require long-range understanding, such as literary texts, we show that TREQA is competitive with and, in some cases, outperforms state-of-the-art neural and LLM-based metrics in ranking alternative paragraph-level translations, despite never being explicitly optimized to correlate with human judgments. Furthermore, the generated questions and answers offer interpretability: empirical analysis shows that they effectively target translation errors identified by experts in evaluated datasets.

      As large language models take on growing roles as automated evaluators in practical settings, a critical question arises: Can individuals persuade an LLM judge to assign unfairly high scores? This study is the first to reveal that strategically embedded persuasive language can bias LLM judges when scoring mathematical reasoning tasks, where correctness should be independent of stylistic variation. Grounded in Aristotle's rhetorical principles, we formalize seven persuasion techniques (Majority, Consistency, Flattery, Reciprocity, Pity, Authority, Identity) and embed them into otherwise identical responses. Across six math benchmarks, we find that persuasive language leads LLM judges to assign inflated scores to incorrect solutions, by up to 8% on average, with Consistency causing the most severe distortion. Notably, increasing model size does not substantially mitigate this vulnerability. Further analysis demonstrates that combining multiple persuasion techniques amplifies the bias, and pairwise evaluation is likewise susceptible. Moreover, the persuasive effect persists under counter prompting strategies, highlighting a critical vulnerability in LLM-as-a-Judge pipelines and underscoring the need for robust defenses against persuasion-based attacks.

      The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture is a cornerstone of modern state-of-the-art (SOTA) large language models (LLMs). MoE models facilitate scalability by enabling sparse parameter activation. However, traditional MoE architecture uses homogeneous experts of a uniform size, activating a fixed number of parameters irrespective of input complexity and thus limiting computational efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Grove MoE, a novel architecture incorporating experts of varying sizes, inspired by the heterogeneous big.LITTLE CPU architecture. This architecture features novel adjugate experts with a dynamic activation mechanism, enabling model capacity expansion while maintaining manageable computational overhead. Building on this architecture, we present GroveMoE-Base and GroveMoE-Inst, 33B-parameter LLMs developed by applying an upcycling strategy to the Qwen3-30B-A3B-Base model during mid-training and post-training. GroveMoE models dynamically activate 3.14-3.28B parameters based on token complexity and achieve performance comparable to SOTA open-source models of similar or even larger size.

      The integration of LLMs into robots has witnessed significant growth, where LLMs can convert instructions into executable robot policies. However, the inherent vulnerability of LLMs to jailbreak attacks brings critical security risks from the digital domain to the physical world. An attacked LLM-based robot could execute harmful policies and cause physical harm. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility and rationale of jailbreak attacks against LLM-based robots and answer three research questions: (1) How applicable are existing LLM jailbreak attacks against LLM-based robots? (2) What unique challenges arise if they are not directly applicable? (3) How to defend against such jailbreak attacks? To this end, we first construct a "human-object-environment" robot risks-oriented Harmful-RLbench and then conduct a measurement study on LLM-based robot systems. Our findings conclude that traditional LLM jailbreak attacks are inapplicable in robot scenarios, and we identify two unique challenges: determining policy-executable optimization directions and accurately evaluating robot-jailbroken policies. To enable a more thorough security analysis, we introduce POEX (POlicy EXecutable) jailbreak, a red-teaming framework that induces harmful yet executable policy to jailbreak LLM-based robots. POEX incorporates hidden layer gradient optimization to guarantee jailbreak success and policy execution as well as a multi-agent evaluator to accurately assess the practical executability of policies. Experiments conducted on the real-world robotic systems and in simulation demonstrate the efficacy of POEX, highlighting critical security vulnerabilities and its transferability across LLMs. Finally, we propose prompt-based and model-based defenses to mitigate attacks. Our findings underscore the urgent need for security measures to ensure the safe deployment of LLM-based robots in critical applications.

      Insider threats, which can lead to severe losses, remain a major security concern. While machine learning-based insider threat detection (ITD) methods have shown promising results, their progress is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality data. Enterprise data is sensitive and rarely accessible, while publicly available datasets, when limited in scale due to cost, lack sufficient real-world coverage; and when purely synthetic, they fail to capture rich semantics and realistic user behavior. To address this, we propose Chimera, the first large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent framework that automatically simulates both benign and malicious insider activities and collects diverse logs across diverse enterprise environments. Chimera models each employee with agents that have role-specific behavior and integrates modules for group meetings, pairwise interactions, and autonomous scheduling, capturing realistic organizational dynamics. It incorporates 15 types of insider attacks (e.g., IP theft, system sabotage) and has been deployed to simulate activities in three sensitive domains: technology company, finance corporation, and medical institution, producing a new dataset, ChimeraLog. We assess ChimeraLog via human studies and quantitative analysis, confirming its diversity, realism, and presence of explainable threat patterns. Evaluations of existing ITD methods show an average F1-score of 0.83, which is significantly lower than 0.99 on the CERT dataset, demonstrating ChimeraLog's higher difficulty and utility for advancing ITD research.

      Unit testing plays a pivotal role in the software development lifecycle, as it ensures code quality. However, writing high-quality unit tests remains a time-consuming task for developers in practice. More recently, the application of large language models (LLMs) in automated unit test generation has demonstrated promising results. Existing approaches primarily focus on interpreted programming languages (e.g., Java), while mature solutions tailored to compiled programming languages like C++ are yet to be explored. The intricate language features of C++, such as pointers, templates, and virtual functions, pose particular challenges for LLMs in generating both executable and high-coverage unit tests. To tackle the aforementioned problems, this paper introduces CITYWALK, a novel LLM-based framework for C++ unit test generation. CITYWALK enhances LLMs by providing a comprehensive understanding of the dependency relationships within the project under test via program analysis. Furthermore, CITYWALK incorporates language-specific knowledge about C++ derived from project documentation and empirical observations, significantly improving the correctness of the LLM-generated unit tests. We implement CITYWALK by employing the widely popular LLM GPT-4o.

It contains diverse instructions for website generation, created through the combined efforts of human annotators and GPT-4o. These instructions span three major categories and thirteen minor categories, encompassing nearly all important types of web applications. To assess the quality of the generated websites, we use GPT-4o to generate test cases targeting each functionality described in the instructions, and then manually filter, adjust, and organize them to ensure accuracy, resulting in 647 test cases. Each test case specifies an operation to be performed on the website and the expected result after the operation. To automate testing and improve reproducibility, we employ a powerful web-navigation agent to execute tests on the generated websites and determine whether the observed responses align with the expected results. We evaluate three high-performance code-agent frameworks, Bolt.diy, OpenHands, and Aider, using multiple proprietary and open-source LLMs as engines. The best-performing combination, Bolt.diy powered by DeepSeek-R1, achieves only 27.8\% accuracy on the test cases, highlighting the challenging nature of our benchmark.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing how users interact with information systems, yet their high inference cost poses serious scalability and sustainability challenges. Caching inference responses, allowing them to be retrieved without another forward pass through the LLM, has emerged as one possible solution. Traditional exact-match caching, however, overlooks the semantic similarity between queries, leading to unnecessary recomputation. Semantic caching addresses this by retrieving responses based on semantic similarity, but introduces a fundamentally different cache eviction problem: one must account for mismatch costs between incoming queries and cached responses. Moreover, key system parameters, such as query arrival probabilities and serving costs, are often unknown and must be learned over time. Existing semantic caching methods are largely ad-hoc, lacking theoretical foundations and unable to adapt to real-world uncertainty. In this paper, we present a principled, learning-based framework for semantic cache eviction under unknown query and cost distributions. We formulate both offline optimization and online learning variants of the problem, and develop provably efficient algorithms with state-of-the-art guarantees. We also evaluate our framework on a synthetic dataset, showing that our proposed algorithms perform matching or superior performance compared with baselines.

      Addressing contextual privacy concerns remains challenging in interactive settings where large language models (LLMs) process information from multiple sources (e.g., summarizing meetings with private and public information). We introduce a multi-agent framework that decomposes privacy reasoning into specialized subtasks (extraction, classification), reducing the information load on any single agent while enabling iterative validation and more reliable adherence to contextual privacy norms. To understand how privacy errors emerge and propagate, we conduct a systematic ablation over information-flow topologies, revealing when and why upstream detection mistakes cascade into downstream leakage. Experiments on the ConfAIde and PrivacyLens benchmark with several open-source and closed-sourced LLMs demonstrate that our best multi-agent configuration substantially reduces private information leakage (\textbf{18\%} on ConfAIde and \textbf{19\%} on PrivacyLens with GPT-4o) while preserving the fidelity of public content, outperforming single-agent baselines. These results highlight the promise of principled information-flow design in multi-agent systems for contextual privacy with LLMs.

      Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with diverse human values requires moving beyond a single holistic "better-than" preference criterion. While collecting fine-grained, aspect-specific preference data is more reliable and scalable, existing methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) struggle with the severe noise and conflicts inherent in such aggregated datasets. In this paper, we tackle this challenge from a data-centric perspective. We first derive the Direct Multi-Preference Optimization (DMPO) objective, and uncover a key Preference Divergence (PD) term that quantifies inter-aspect preference conflicts. Instead of using this term for direct optimization, we leverage it to formulate a novel, theoretically-grounded data selection principle. Our principle advocates for selecting a subset of high-consensus data-identified by the most negative PD values-for efficient DPO training. We prove the optimality of this strategy by analyzing the loss bounds of the DMPO objective in the selection problem. To operationalize our approach, we introduce practical methods of PD term estimation and length bias mitigation, thereby proposing our PD selection method. Evaluation on the UltraFeedback dataset with three varying conflict levels shows that our simple yet effective strategy achieves over 10% relative improvement against both the standard holistic preference and a stronger oracle using aggregated preference signals, all while boosting training efficiency and obviating the need for intractable holistic preference annotating, unlocking the potential of robust LLM alignment via fine-grained preference signals.

      Text-to-SQL bridges the gap between natural language and structured database language, thus allowing non-technical users to easily query databases. Traditional approaches model text-to-SQL as a direct translation task, where a given Natural Language Query (NLQ) is mapped to an SQL command. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved translation accuracy, however, these methods all require that the target database is pre-specified. This becomes problematic in scenarios with multiple extensive databases, where identifying the correct database becomes a crucial yet overlooked step. In this paper, we propose a three-stage end-to-end text-to-SQL framework to identify the user's intended database before generating SQL queries. Our approach leverages LLMs and prompt engineering to extract implicit information from natural language queries (NLQs) in the form of a ruleset. We then train a large db\_id prediction model, which includes a RoBERTa-based finetuned encoder, to predict the correct Database identifier (db\_id) based on both the NLQ and the LLM-generated rules. Finally, we refine the generated SQL by using critic agents to correct errors. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms the current state-of-the-art models in both database intent prediction and SQL generation accuracy.

      Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is a novel task enabling Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to navigate in outdoor environments through natural language instructions and visual cues. However, it remains challenging due to the complex spatial relationships in aerial scenes.In this paper, we propose a training-free, zero-shot framework for aerial VLN tasks, where the large language model (LLM) is leveraged as the agent for action prediction. Specifically, we develop a novel Semantic-Topo-Metric Representation (STMR) to enhance the spatial reasoning capabilities of LLMs. This is achieved by extracting and projecting instruction-related semantic masks onto a top-down map, which presents spatial and topological information about surrounding landmarks and grows during the navigation process. At each step, a local map centered at the UAV is extracted from the growing top-down map, and transformed into a ma trix representation with distance metrics, serving as the text prompt to LLM for action prediction in response to the given instruction. Experiments conducted in real and simulation environments have proved the effectiveness and robustness of our method, achieving absolute success rate improvements of 26.8% and 5.8% over current state-of-the-art methods on simple and complex navigation tasks, respectively. The dataset and code will be released soon.

      Large language models (LLMs) often fail to ask effective questions under uncertainty, making them unreliable in domains where proactive information-gathering is essential for decision-making. We present ALignment via Fine-grained Attributes, (ALFA) a framework that improves LLM question-asking by (i) decomposing the notion of a "good" question into a set of theory-grounded attributes (e.g., clarity, relevance), (ii) controllably synthesizing attribute-specific question variations, and (iii) aligning models via preference-based optimization to explicitly learn to ask better questions along these fine-grained attributes. Focusing on clinical reasoning as a case study, we introduce the MediQ-AskDocs dataset, composed of 17k real-world clinical interactions augmented with 80k attribute-specific preference pairs of follow-up questions, as well as a novel expert-annotated interactive healthcare QA task to evaluate question-asking abilities. Models aligned with ALFA reduce diagnostic errors by 56.6% on MediQ-AskDocs compared to SoTA instruction-tuned LLMs, with a question-level win-rate of 64.4% and strong generalizability. Our findings suggest that explicitly guiding question-asking with structured, fine-grained attributes offers a scalable path to improve LLMs, especially in expert application domains.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results on a variety of mathematical benchmarks. However, concerns remain as to whether these successes reflect genuine reasoning or superficial pattern recognition. Common evaluation methods, which focus on the either the final answer or the reasoning process, fail to assess the entire problem-solving procedure. To address these limitations, we introduce SMART: a Self-Generating and Self-Validating Multi-Dimensional Assessment Framework, together with its corresponding benchmark, SMART-Bench. SMART decomposes the entire problem solving process into four distinct cognitive dimensions: Understanding, Reasoning, Arithmetic, and Reflection \& Refinement. Each dimension is evaluated independently through tailored tasks, enabling interpretable and fine-grained analysis of LLM behavior. We apply SMART to 21 state-of-the-art open- and closed-source LLMs, uncovering significant discrepancies in their abilities across different dimensions. Our findings reveal genuine weaknesses in current LLMs and motivate a new metric, the All-Pass Score, to better capture true problem-solving capabilities. Code and benchmarks will be released upon acceptance.

      Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Unlike traditional RL approaches, RLVR leverages rule-based feedback to guide LLMs in generating and refining complex reasoning chains -- a process critically dependent on effective exploration strategies. While prior work has demonstrated RLVR's empirical success, the fundamental mechanisms governing LLMs' exploration behaviors remain underexplored. This technical report presents a systematic investigation of exploration capacities in RLVR, covering four main aspects: (1) exploration space shaping, where we develop quantitative metrics to characterize LLMs' capability boundaries; (2) entropy-performance exchange, analyzed across training stages, individual instances, and token-level patterns; and (3) RL performance optimization, examining methods to effectively translate exploration gains into measurable improvements. By unifying previously identified insights with new empirical evidence, this work aims to provide a foundational framework for advancing RLVR systems.

      Word clouds are a common way to summarize qualitative interviews, yet traditional frequency-based methods often fail in conversational contexts: they surface filler words, ignore paraphrase, and fragment semantically related ideas. This limits their usefulness in early-stage analysis, when researchers need fast, interpretable overviews of what participant actually said. We introduce ThemeClouds, an open-source visualization tool that uses large language models (LLMs) to generate thematic, participant-weighted word clouds from dialogue transcripts. The system prompts an LLM to identify concept-level themes across a corpus and then counts how many unique participants mention each topic, yielding a visualization grounded in breadth of mention rather than raw term frequency. Researchers can customize prompts and visualization parameters, providing transparency and control. Using interviews from a user study comparing five recording-device configurations (31 participants; 155 transcripts, Whisper ASR), our approach surfaces more actionable device concerns than frequency clouds and topic-modeling baselines (e.g., LDA, BERTopic). We discuss design trade-offs for integrating LLM assistance into qualitative workflows, implications for interpretability and researcher agency, and opportunities for interactive analyses such as per-condition contrasts (``diff clouds'').

      Contemporary language models are increasingly multilingual, but Chinese LLM developers must navigate complex political and business considerations of language diversity. Language policy in China aims at influencing the public discourse and governing a multi-ethnic society, and has gradually transitioned from a pluralist to a more assimilationist approach since 1949. We explore the impact of these influences on current language technology. We evaluate six open-source multilingual LLMs pre-trained by Chinese companies on 18 languages, spanning a wide range of Chinese, Asian, and Anglo-European languages. Our experiments show Chinese LLMs performance on diverse languages is indistinguishable from international LLMs. Similarly, the models' technical reports also show lack of consideration for pretraining data language coverage except for English and Mandarin Chinese. Examining Chinese AI policy, model experiments, and technical reports, we find no sign of any consistent policy, either for or against, language diversity in China's LLM development. This leaves a puzzling fact that while China regulates both the languages people use daily as well as language model development, they do not seem to have any policy on the languages in language models.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) with inference-time scaling techniques show promise for code generation, yet face notable efficiency and scalability challenges. Construction-based tree-search methods suffer from rapid growth in tree size, high token consumption, and lack of anytime property. In contrast, improvement-based methods offer better performance but often struggle with uninformative reward signals and inefficient search strategies. In this work, we propose \textbf{ReLoc}, a unified local search framework which effectively performs step-by-step code revision. Specifically, ReLoc explores a series of local revisions through four key algorithmic components: initial code drafting, neighborhood code generation, candidate evaluation, and incumbent code updating, each of which can be instantiated with specific decision rules to realize different local search algorithms such as Hill Climbing (HC) or Genetic Algorithm (GA). Furthermore, we develop a specialized revision reward model that evaluates code quality based on revision distance to produce fine-grained preferences that guide the local search toward more promising candidates. Finally, our extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance across diverse code generation tasks, significantly outperforming both construction-based tree search as well as the state-of-the-art improvement-based code generation methods.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been leveraged for asset pricing tasks and stock trading applications, enabling AI agents to generate investment decisions from unstructured financial data. However, most evaluations of LLM timing-based investing strategies are conducted on narrow timeframes and limited stock universes, overstating effectiveness due to survivorship and data-snooping biases. We critically assess their generalizability and robustness by proposing FINSABER, a backtesting framework evaluating timing-based strategies across longer periods and a larger universe of symbols. Systematic backtests over two decades and 100+ symbols reveal that previously reported LLM advantages deteriorate significantly under broader cross-section and over a longer-term evaluation. Our market regime analysis further demonstrates that LLM strategies are overly conservative in bull markets, underperforming passive benchmarks, and overly aggressive in bear markets, incurring heavy losses. These findings highlight the need to develop LLM strategies that are able to prioritise trend detection and regime-aware risk controls over mere scaling of framework complexity.

      Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to write policy code for controlling robots has gained significant attention. However, in long-horizon implicative tasks, this approach often results in API parameter, comments and sequencing errors, leading to task failure.

Additionally, a novel demonstration library update mechanism which learned from success allows it to generalize to previously failed tasks. We validate the framework in the Long-horizon Desktop Implicative Placement (LDIP) dataset across various baseline models, where Triple-S successfully executes 89% of tasks in both observable and partially observable scenarios. Experiments in both simulation and real-world robot settings further validated the effectiveness of Triple-S. Our code and dataset is available at: https://github.com/Ghbbbbb/Triple-S.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely adopted for automated code generation with promising results. Although prior research has assessed LLM-generated code and identified various quality issues -- such as redundancy, poor maintainability, and sub-optimal performance a systematic understanding and categorization of these inefficiencies remain unexplored. Without such knowledge, practitioners struggle to optimize LLM-generated code for real-world applications, limiting its adoption. This study can also guide improving code LLMs, enhancing the quality and efficiency of code generation. Therefore, in this study, we empirically investigate inefficiencies in LLM-generated code by state-of-the-art models, i.e., CodeLlama, DeepSeek-Coder, and CodeGemma. To do so, we analyze 492 generated code snippets in the HumanEval++ dataset. We then construct a taxonomy of inefficiencies in LLM-generated code that includes 5 categories General Logic, Performance, Readability, Maintainability, and Errors) and 19 subcategories of inefficiencies. We then validate the proposed taxonomy through an online survey with 58 LLM practitioners and researchers. Our study indicates that logic and performance-related inefficiencies are the most popular, relevant, and frequently co-occur and impact overall code quality inefficiency. Our taxonomy provides a structured basis for evaluating the quality LLM-generated code and guiding future research to improve code generation efficiency.

We align these labeled sentiment signals with forward returns over 1-to-7-day horizons to evaluate their statistical efficacy and market tradability.

      Recently, quantization has been widely used for the compression and acceleration of large language models (LLMs). Due to the outliers in LLMs, it is crucial to flatten weights and activations to minimize quantization error with equally spaced quantization points. Prior research explores various pre-quantization transformations to suppress outliers, such as per-channel scaling and Hadamard transformation. However, we observe that these transformed weights and activations can still exhibit steep and dispersed distributions. In this paper, we propose FlatQuant (Fast and Learnable Affine Transformation), a new post-training quantization approach that enhances the flatness of weights and activations. Our approach identifies optimal affine transformations for each linear layer, calibrated in hours via a lightweight objective. To reduce runtime overhead of affine transformation, we apply Kronecker product with two lightweight matrices, and fuse all operations in FlatQuant into a single kernel. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlatQuant establishes a new state-of-the-art benchmark for quantization. For example, it achieves less than 1\% accuracy drop for W4A4 quantization on the LLaMA-3-70B model, surpassing SpinQuant by 7.5\%. Additionally, it provides up to 2.3x prefill speedup and 1.7x decoding speedup compared to the FP16 model. Code is available at: https://github.com/ruikangliu/FlatQuant.

      Numerous benchmarks have been built to evaluate the domain-specific abilities of large language models (LLMs), highlighting the need for effective and efficient benchmark construction. Existing domain-specific benchmarks primarily focus on the scaling law, relying on massive corpora for supervised fine-tuning or generating extensive question sets for broad coverage. However, the impact of corpus and question-answer (QA) set design on the precision and recall of domain-specific LLMs remains unexplored. In this paper, we address this gap and demonstrate that the scaling law is not always the optimal principle for benchmark construction in specific domains. Instead, we propose Comp-Comp, an iterative benchmarking framework based on a comprehensiveness-compactness principle. Here, comprehensiveness ensures semantic recall of the domain, while compactness enhances precision, guiding both corpus and QA set construction. To validate our framework, we conducted a case study in a well-renowned university, resulting in the creation of XUBench, a large-scale and comprehensive closed-domain benchmark. Although we use the academic domain as the case in this work, our Comp-Comp framework is designed to be extensible beyond academia, providing valuable insights for benchmark construction across various domains.

      With the breakthrough progress of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing and multimodal tasks, efficiently deploying them on resource-constrained edge devices has become a critical challenge. The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture enhances model capacity through sparse activation, but faces two major difficulties in practical deployment: (1) The presence of numerous outliers in activation distributions leads to severe degradation in quantization accuracy for both activations and weights, significantly impairing inference performance; (2) Under limited memory, efficient offloading and collaborative inference of expert modules struggle to balance latency and throughput. To address these issues, this paper proposes an efficient MoE edge deployment scheme based on Hessian-Aware Quantization (HAQ) and CPU-GPU collaborative inference. First, by introducing smoothed Hessian matrix quantization, we achieve joint 8-bit quantization of activations and weights, which significantly alleviates the accuracy loss caused by outliers while ensuring efficient implementation on mainstream hardware. Second, we design an expert-level collaborative offloading and inference mechanism, which, combined with expert activation path statistics, enables efficient deployment and scheduling of expert modules between CPU and GPU, greatly reducing memory footprint and inference latency. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method on mainstream large models such as the OPT series and Mixtral 8*7B: on datasets like Wikitext2 and C4, the inference accuracy of the low-bit quantized model approaches that of the full-precision model, while GPU memory usage is reduced by about 60%, and inference latency is significantly improved.

      Multi-agent large language model (LLM) systems have shown strong potential in complex reasoning and collaborative decision-making tasks. However, most existing coordination schemes rely on static or full-context routing strategies, which lead to excessive token consumption, redundant memory exposure, and limited adaptability across interaction rounds. We introduce RCR-Router, a modular and role-aware context routing framework designed to enable efficient, adaptive collaboration in multi-agent LLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first routing approach that dynamically selects semantically relevant memory subsets for each agent based on its role and task stage, while adhering to a strict token budget. A lightweight scoring policy guides memory selection, and agent outputs are iteratively integrated into a shared memory store to facilitate progressive context refinement. To better evaluate model behavior, we further propose an Answer Quality Score metric that captures LLM-generated explanations beyond standard QA accuracy. Experiments on three multi-hop QA benchmarks -- HotPotQA, MuSiQue, and 2WikiMultihop -- demonstrate that RCR-Router reduces token usage (up to 30%) while improving or maintaining answer quality. These results highlight the importance of structured memory routing and output-aware evaluation in advancing scalable multi-agent LLM systems.

      The autoregressive decoding in LLMs is the major inference bottleneck due to the memory-intensive operations and limited hardware bandwidth. 3D-stacked architecture is a promising solution with significantly improved memory bandwidth, which vertically stacked multi DRAM dies on top of logic die. However, our experiments also show the 3D-stacked architecture faces severer thermal issues compared to 2D architecture, in terms of thermal temperature, gradient and scalability. To better exploit the potential of 3D-stacked architecture, we present Tasa, a heterogeneous architecture with cross-stack thermal optimizations to balance the temperature distribution and maximize the performance under the thermal constraints. High-performance core is designed for compute-intensive operations, while high-efficiency core is used for memory-intensive operators, e.g. attention layers. Furthermore, we propose a bandwidth sharing scheduling to improve the bandwidth utilization in such heterogeneous architecture. Extensive thermal experiments show that our Tasa architecture demonstrates greater scalability compared with the homogeneous 3D-stacked architecture, i.e. up to 5.55 $\tccentigrade$, 9.37 $\tccentigrade$, and 7.91 $\tccentigrade$ peak temperature reduction for 48, 60, and 72 core configurations.

      LLM inference on mobile devices faces extraneous challenges due to limited memory bandwidth and computational resources. To address these issues, speculative inference and processing-in-memory (PIM) techniques have been explored at the algorithmic and hardware levels. However, speculative inference results in more compute-intensive GEMM operations, creating new design trade-offs for existing GEMV-accelerated PIM architectures. Furthermore, there exists a significant amount of redundant draft tokens in tree-based speculative inference, necessitating efficient token management schemes to minimize energy consumption. In this work, we present LP-Spec, an architecture-dataflow co-design leveraging hybrid LPDDR5 performance-enhanced PIM architecture with draft token pruning and dynamic workload scheduling to accelerate LLM speculative inference. A near-data memory controller is proposed to enable data reallocation between DRAM and PIM banks. Furthermore, a data allocation unit based on the hardware-aware draft token pruner is developed to minimize energy consumption and fully exploit parallel execution opportunities. Compared to end-to-end LLM inference on other mobile solutions such as mobile NPUs or GEMV-accelerated PIMs, our LP-Spec achieves 13.21x, 7.56x, and 99.87x improvements in performance, energy efficiency, and energy-delay-product (EDP). Compared with prior AttAcc PIM and RTX 3090 GPU, LP-Spec can obtain 12.83x and 415.31x EDP reduction benefits.

      Estimating individualized treatment effects from observational data presents a persistent challenge due to unmeasured confounding and structural bias. Causal Machine Learning (causal ML) methods, such as causal trees and doubly robust estimators, provide tools for estimating conditional average treatment effects. These methods have limited effectiveness in complex real-world environments due to the presence of latent confounders or those described in unstructured formats. Moreover, reliance on domain experts for confounder identification and rule interpretation introduces high annotation cost and scalability concerns. In this work, we proposed Large Language Model-based agents for automated confounder discovery and subgroup analysis that integrate agents into the causal ML pipeline to simulate domain expertise. Our framework systematically performs subgroup identification and confounding structure discovery by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of LLM-based agents, which reduces human dependency while preserving interpretability. Experiments on real-world medical datasets show that our proposed approach enhances treatment effect estimation robustness by narrowing confidence intervals and uncovering unrecognized confounding biases. Our findings suggest that LLM-based agents offer a promising path toward scalable, trustworthy, and semantically aware causal inference.

      We demonstrate, for the first time, fully quantized training (FQT) of large language models (LLMs) using predominantly 4-bit floating-point (FP4) precision for weights, activations, and gradients on datasets up to 200 billion tokens. We extensively investigate key design choices for FP4, including block sizes, scaling formats, and rounding methods. Our analysis shows that the NVFP4 format, where each block of 16 FP4 values (E2M1) shares a scale represented in E4M3, provides optimal results. We use stochastic rounding for backward and update passes and round-to-nearest for the forward pass to enhance stability. Additionally, we identify a theoretical and empirical threshold for effective quantized training: when the gradient norm falls below approximately $\sqrt{3}$ times the quantization noise, quantized training becomes less effective. Leveraging these insights, we successfully train a 7-billion-parameter model on 256 Intel Gaudi2 accelerators. The resulting FP4-trained model achieves downstream task performance comparable to a standard BF16 baseline, confirming that FP4 training is a practical and highly efficient approach for large-scale LLM training.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language processing due to their strong generalization and sequence modeling capabilities. However, their direct application to time series forecasting remains challenging due to two fundamental issues: the inherent heterogeneity of temporal patterns and the modality gap between continuous numerical signals and discrete language representations. In this work, we propose TALON, a unified framework that enhances LLM-based forecasting by modeling temporal heterogeneity and enforcing semantic alignment. Specifically, we design a Heterogeneous Temporal Encoder that partitions multivariate time series into structurally coherent segments, enabling localized expert modeling across diverse temporal patterns. To bridge the modality gap, we introduce a Semantic Alignment Module that aligns temporal features with LLM-compatible representations, enabling effective integration of time series into language-based models while eliminating the need for handcrafted prompts during inference. Extensive experiments on seven real-world benchmarks demonstrate that TALON achieves superior performance across all datasets, with average MSE improvements of up to 11\% over recent state-of-the-art methods. These results underscore the effectiveness of incorporating both pattern-aware and semantic-aware designs when adapting LLMs for time series forecasting.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in systems that retrieve and summarize content from multiple sources, such as search engines and AI assistants. While these models enhance user experience by generating coherent summaries, they obscure the contributions of original content creators, raising concerns about credit attribution and compensation. We address the challenge of valuing individual documents used in LLM-generated summaries. We propose using Shapley values, a game-theoretic method that allocates credit based on each document's marginal contribution. Although theoretically appealing, Shapley values are expensive to compute at scale. We therefore propose Cluster Shapley, an efficient approximation algorithm that leverages semantic similarity between documents. By clustering documents using LLM-based embeddings and computing Shapley values at the cluster level, our method significantly reduces computation while maintaining attribution quality. We demonstrate our approach to a summarization task using Amazon product reviews. Cluster Shapley significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining high accuracy, outperforming baseline methods such as Monte Carlo sampling and Kernel SHAP with a better efficient frontier. Our approach is agnostic to the exact LLM used, the summarization process used, and the evaluation procedure, which makes it broadly applicable to a variety of summarization settings.

      Fine-tuning-as-a-Service introduces a critical vulnerability where a few malicious examples mixed into the user's fine-tuning dataset can compromise the safety alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs). While a recognized paradigm frames safe fine-tuning as a multi-objective optimization problem balancing user task performance with safety alignment, we find existing solutions are critically sensitive to the harmful ratio, with defenses degrading sharply as harmful ratio increases. We diagnose that this failure stems from conflicting gradients, where the user-task update directly undermines the safety objective. To resolve this, we propose SafeGrad, a novel method that employs gradient surgery. When a conflict is detected, SafeGrad nullifies the harmful component of the user-task gradient by projecting it onto the orthogonal plane of the alignment gradient, allowing the model to learn the user's task without sacrificing safety. To further enhance robustness and data efficiency, we employ a KL-divergence alignment loss that learns the rich, distributional safety profile of the well-aligned foundation model. Extensive experiments show that SafeGrad provides state-of-the-art defense across various LLMs and datasets, maintaining robust safety even at high harmful ratios without compromising task fidelity.

      Software correctness is ensured mathematically through formal verification, which involves the resources of generating formal requirement specifications and having an implementation that must be verified. Tools such as model-checkers and theorem provers ensure software correctness by verifying the implementation against the specification. Formal methods deployment is regularly enforced in the development of safety-critical systems e.g. aerospace, medical devices and autonomous systems. Generating these specifications from informal and ambiguous natural language requirements remains the key challenge. Our project, VERIFAI^{1}, aims to investigate automated and semi-automated approaches to bridge this gap, using techniques from Natural Language Processing (NLP), ontology-based domain modelling, artefact reuse, and large language models (LLMs). This position paper presents a preliminary synthesis of relevant literature to identify recurring challenges and prospective research directions in the generation of verifiable specifications from informal requirements.

      Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning over structured data, including text-attributed graphs, which are common in domains such as citation networks, social platforms, and knowledge graphs. GNNs are not inherently interpretable and thus, many explanation methods have been proposed. However, existing explanation methods often struggle to generate interpretable, fine-grained rationales, especially when node attributes include rich natural language. In this work, we introduce LOGIC, a lightweight, post-hoc framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to generate faithful and interpretable explanations for GNN predictions. LOGIC projects GNN node embeddings into the LLM embedding space and constructs hybrid prompts that interleave soft prompts with textual inputs from the graph structure. This enables the LLM to reason about GNN internal representations and produce natural language explanations along with concise explanation subgraphs. Our experiments across four real-world TAG datasets demonstrate that LOGIC achieves a favorable trade-off between fidelity and sparsity, while significantly improving human-centric metrics such as insightfulness. LOGIC sets a new direction for LLM-based explainability in graph learning by aligning GNN internals with human reasoning.

      Global cloud service providers handle inference workloads for Large Language Models (LLMs) that span latency-sensitive (e.g., chatbots) and insensitive (e.g., report writing) tasks, resulting in diverse and often conflicting Service Level Agreement (SLA) requirements. Managing such mixed workloads is challenging due to the complexity of the inference serving stack, which encompasses multiple models, GPU hardware, and global data centers. Existing solutions often silo such fast and slow tasks onto separate GPU resource pools with different SLAs, but this leads to significant under-utilization of expensive accelerators due to load mismatch. In this article, we characterize the LLM serving workloads at Microsoft Office 365, one of the largest users of LLMs within Microsoft Azure cloud with over 10 million requests per day, and highlight key observations across workloads in different data center regions and across time. This is one of the first such public studies of Internet-scale LLM workloads. We use these insights to propose SageServe, a comprehensive LLM serving framework that dynamically adapts to workload demands using multi-timescale control knobs. It combines short-term request routing to data centers with long-term scaling of GPU VMs and model placement with higher lead times, and co-optimizes the routing and resource allocation problem using a traffic forecast model and an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) solution. We evaluate SageServe through real runs and realistic simulations on 10 million production requests across three regions and four open-source models. We achieve up to 25% savings in GPU-hours compared to the current baseline deployment and reduce GPU-hour wastage due to inefficient auto-scaling by 80%, resulting in a potential monthly cost savings of up to $2.5 million, while maintaining tail latency and meeting SLAs.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with dynamic knowledge updates, especially when new information conflicts with deeply embedded facts. Such conflicting factual edits often lead to two critical issues: resistance to adopting the new fact and severe catastrophic forgetting of unrelated knowledge. This paper introduces and evaluates a novel "unlearn-then-learn" strategy for precise knowledge editing in LLMs, leveraging the parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) technique, Infused Adapter by Inhibiting and Amplifying Inner Activations ($IA^3$). Crucially, this two-stage approach is powered by an initial circuit localization phase that identifies and targets the specific internal components responsible for encoding the conflicting fact. Through a rigorous experimental methodology on microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct, we demonstrate that this mechanistically informed two-stage approach achieves near-perfect accuracy (98.50%) for the new, modulated fact while simultaneously effectively suppressing the original conflicting fact (96.00% forget rate). Critically, our strategy exhibits unprecedented localization (72.00% F_control accuracy), dramatically mitigating catastrophic forgetting observed in direct fine-tuning approaches (which showed as low as ~20% F_control accuracy), a direct benefit of our targeted interpretability-guided intervention. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals a nuanced mechanism of "soft forgetting," where original knowledge is suppressed from default retrieval but remains latent and conditionally accessible, enhancing model safety and control. These findings represent a significant advancement towards precise, localized, and safe knowledge management in compact LLMs.

      Purpose: This study proposes a framework for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with differential privacy (DP) to perform multi-abnormality classification on radiology report text. By injecting calibrated noise during fine-tuning, the framework seeks to mitigate the privacy risks associated with sensitive patient data and protect against data leakage while maintaining classification performance. Materials and Methods: We used 50,232 radiology reports from the publicly available MIMIC-CXR chest radiography and CT-RATE computed tomography datasets, collected between 2011 and 2019. Fine-tuning of LLMs was conducted to classify 14 labels from MIMIC-CXR dataset, and 18 labels from CT-RATE dataset using Differentially Private Low-Rank Adaptation (DP-LoRA) in high and moderate privacy regimes (across a range of privacy budgets = {0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0}). Model performance was evaluated using weighted F1 score across three model architectures: BERT-medium, BERT-small, and ALBERT-base. Statistical analyses compared model performance across different privacy levels to quantify the privacy-utility trade-off. Results: We observe a clear privacy-utility trade-off through our experiments on 2 different datasets and 3 different models. Under moderate privacy guarantees the DP fine-tuned models achieved comparable weighted F1 scores of 0.88 on MIMIC-CXR and 0.59 on CT-RATE, compared to non-private LoRA baselines of 0.90 and 0.78, respectively. Conclusion: Differentially private fine-tuning using LoRA enables effective and privacy-preserving multi-abnormality classification from radiology reports, addressing a key challenge in fine-tuning LLMs on sensitive medical data.

      As AI systems become more integrated into daily life, the need for safer and more reliable moderation has never been greater. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, surpassing earlier models in complexity and performance. Their evaluation across diverse tasks has consistently showcased their potential, enabling the development of adaptive and personalized agents. However, despite these advancements, LLMs remain prone to errors, particularly in areas requiring nuanced moral reasoning. They struggle with detecting implicit hate, offensive language, and gender biases due to the subjective and context-dependent nature of these issues. Moreover, their reliance on training data can inadvertently reinforce societal biases, leading to inconsistencies and ethical concerns in their outputs. To explore the limitations of LLMs in this role, we developed an experimental framework based on state-of-the-art (SOTA) models to assess human emotions and offensive behaviors. The framework introduces a unified benchmark dataset encompassing 49 distinct categories spanning the wide spectrum of human emotions, offensive and hateful text, and gender and racial biases. Furthermore, we introduced SafePhi, a QLoRA fine-tuned version of Phi-4, adapting diverse ethical contexts and outperforming benchmark moderators by achieving a Macro F1 score of 0.89, where OpenAI Moderator and Llama Guard score 0.77 and 0.74, respectively. This research also highlights the critical domains where LLM moderators consistently underperformed, pressing the need to incorporate more heterogeneous and representative data with human-in-the-loop, for better model robustness and explainability.

However, students may inherit the teacher's privacy when the teacher is trained on private data. In this work, we systematically characterize and investigate membership and memorization privacy risks inherent in six LLM KD techniques. Using instruction-tuning settings that span seven NLP tasks, together with three teacher model families (GPT-2, LLAMA-2, and OPT), and various size student models, we demonstrate that all existing LLM KD approaches carry membership and memorization privacy risks from the teacher to its students. However, the extent of privacy risks varies across different KD techniques. We systematically analyse how key LLM KD components (KD objective functions, student training data and NLP tasks) impact such privacy risks. We also demonstrate a significant disagreement between memorization and membership privacy risks of LLM KD techniques. Finally, we characterize per-block privacy risk and demonstrate that the privacy risk varies across different blocks by a large margin.

      While large language models (LLMs) are widely used for writing, users often struggle to express their nuanced and evolving intents through prompt-based interfaces. Intents -- low-level strategies or preferences for achieving a writing goal -- are often vague, fluid, or even subconscious, making it difficult for users to articulate and adjust them. To address this, we present IntentFlow, which supports the communication of dynamically evolving intents throughout LLM-assisted writing. IntentFlow extracts goals and intents from user prompts and presents them as editable interface components, which users can revise, remove, or refine via direct manipulation or follow-up prompts. Visual links connect each component to the output segments it influences, helping users understand model behavior. In a within-subjects study (N=12), participants using IntentFlow, compared to a chat-based baseline, expressed their intents more easily and in detail, engaged in more meaningful actions to communicate intents, such as adjusting and deleting, and produced outputs that better aligned with their evolving intents. We found that editable intent representations help users refine and consolidate a final set of intents, which can be reused across similar tasks to support consistent and transferable LLM-assisted writing.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) applying Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) scale to trillions of parameters but require vast memory, motivating a line of research to offload expert weights from fast-but-small DRAM (HBM) to denser Flash SSDs. While SSDs provide cost-effective capacity, their read energy per bit is substantially higher than that of DRAM. This paper quantitatively analyzes the energy implications of offloading MoE expert weights to SSDs during the critical decode stage of LLM inference. Our analysis, comparing SSD, CPU memory (DDR), and HBM storage scenarios for models like DeepSeek-R1, reveals that offloading MoE weights to current SSDs drastically increases per-token-generation energy consumption (e.g., by up to ~12x compared to the HBM baseline), dominating the total inference energy budget. Although techniques like prefetching effectively hide access latency, they cannot mitigate this fundamental energy penalty. We further explore future technological scaling, finding that the inherent sparsity of MoE models could potentially make SSDs energy-viable if Flash read energy improves significantly, roughly by an order of magnitude.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) face persistent and evolving trustworthiness issues, motivating developers to seek automated and flexible repair methods that enable convenient deployment across diverse scenarios. Existing repair methods like supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) are costly and slow, while prompt engineering lacks robustness and scalability. Representation engineering, which steers model behavior by injecting targeted concept vectors during inference, offers a lightweight, training-free alternative. However, current approaches depend on manually crafted samples and fixed steering strategies, limiting automation and adaptability. To overcome these challenges, we propose MASteer, the first end-to-end framework for trustworthiness repair in LLMs based on representation engineering. MASteer integrates two core components: AutoTester, a multi-agent system that generates diverse, high-quality steer samples tailored to developer needs; and AutoRepairer, which constructs adaptive steering strategies with anchor vectors for automated, context-aware strategy selection during inference. Experiments on standard and customized trustworthiness tasks show MASteer consistently outperforms baselines, improving metrics by 15.36% on LLaMA-3.1-8B-Chat and 4.21% on Qwen-3-8B-Chat, while maintaining general model capabilities.

      Multi-agent applications utilize the advanced capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for intricate task completion through agent collaboration in a workflow. Under this situation, requests from different agents usually access the same shared LLM to perform different kinds of tasks, forcing the shared LLM to suffer excessive loads. However, existing works have low serving performance for these multi-agent applications, mainly due to the ignorance of inter-agent latency and resource differences for request scheduling. We therefore propose Kairos, a multi-agent orchestration system that optimizes end-to-end latency for multi-agent applications. Kairos consists of a workflow orchestrator, a workflow-aware priority scheduler, and a memory-aware dispatcher. The orchestrator collects agent-specific information for online workflow analysis. The scheduler decides the serving priority of the requests based on their latency characteristics to reduce the overall queuing. The dispatcher dispatches the requests to different LLM instances based on their memory demands to avoid GPU overloading. Experimental results show that Kairos reduces end-to-end latency by 17.8% to 28.4% compared to state-of-the-art works.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically fine-tuned for reasoning tasks through a two-stage pipeline of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL), a process fraught with catastrophic forgetting and suboptimal trade-offs between imitation and exploration. Recent single-stage methods attempt to unify SFT and RL using heuristics, but lack a principled mechanism for dynamically balancing the two paradigms. In this paper, we reframe this challenge through the theoretical lens of \textbf{implicit rewards}, viewing SFT and RL not as distinct methods but as complementary reward signals. We introduce \textbf{Adaptive Meta Fine-Tuning (AMFT)}, a novel single-stage algorithm that learns the optimal balance between SFT's implicit, path-level reward and RL's explicit, outcome-based reward. The core of AMFT is a \textbf{meta-gradient adaptive weight controller} that treats the SFT-RL balance as a learnable parameter, dynamically optimizing it to maximize long-term task performance. This forward-looking approach, regularized by policy entropy for stability, autonomously discovers an effective training curriculum. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on challenging benchmarks spanning mathematical reasoning, abstract visual reasoning (General Points), and vision-language navigation (V-IRL). AMFT consistently establishes a new state-of-the-art and demonstrats superior generalization on out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. Ablation studies and training dynamic analysis confirm that the meta-learning controller is crucial for AMFT's stability, sample efficiency, and performance, offering a more principled and effective paradigm for LLM alignment.Our codes are open-sourced via https://github.com/hlxtsyj/AMFT.

      Interactive theorem provers (ITPs) require manual formalization, which is labor-intensive and demands expert knowledge. While automated formalization offers a potential solution, it faces two major challenges: model hallucination (e.g., undefined predicates, symbol misuse, and version incompatibility) and the semantic gap caused by ambiguous or missing premises in natural language descriptions. To address these issues, we propose CRAMF, a Concept-driven Retrieval-Augmented Mathematical Formalization framework. CRAMF enhances LLM-based autoformalization by retrieving formal definitions of core mathematical concepts, providing contextual grounding during code generation. However, applying retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in this setting is non-trivial due to the lack of structured knowledge bases, the polymorphic nature of mathematical concepts, and the high precision required in formal retrieval. We introduce a framework for automatically constructing a concept-definition knowledge base from Mathlib4, the standard mathematical library for the Lean 4 theorem prover, indexing over 26,000 formal definitions and 1,000+ core mathematical concepts. To address conceptual polymorphism, we propose contextual query augmentation with domain- and application-level signals. In addition, we design a dual-channel hybrid retrieval strategy with reranking to ensure accurate and relevant definition retrieval. Experiments on miniF2F, ProofNet, and our newly proposed AdvancedMath benchmark show that CRAMF can be seamlessly integrated into LLM-based autoformalizers, yielding consistent improvements in translation accuracy, achieving up to 62.1% and an average of 29.9% relative improvement.

      Automated translation of legacy C code into Rust aims to ensure memory safety while reducing the burden of manual migration. Early approaches in code translation rely on static rule-based methods, but they suffer from limited coverage due to dependence on predefined rule patterns. Recent works regard the task as a sequence-to-sequence problem by leveraging large language models (LLMs). Although these LLM-based methods are capable of reducing unsafe code blocks, the translated code often exhibits issues in following Rust rules and maintaining semantic consistency. On one hand, existing methods adopt a direct prompting strategy to translate the C code, which struggles to accommodate the syntactic rules between C and Rust. On the other hand, this strategy makes it difficult for LLMs to accurately capture the semantics of complex code. To address these challenges, we propose IRENE, an LLM-based framework that Integrates RulEs aNd sEmantics to enhance translation. IRENE consists of three modules: 1) a rule-augmented retrieval module that selects relevant translation examples based on rules generated from a static analyzer developed by us, thereby improving the handling of Rust rules; 2) a structured summarization module that produces a structured summary for guiding LLMs to enhance the semantic understanding of C code; 3) an error-driven translation module that leverages compiler diagnostics to iteratively refine translations. We evaluate IRENE on two datasets (xCodeEval, a public dataset, and HW-Bench, an industrial dataset provided by Huawei) and eight LLMs, focusing on translation accuracy and safety.

      Recent advances in molecular science have been propelled significantly by large language models (LLMs). However, their effectiveness is limited when relying solely on molecular sequences, which fail to capture the complex structures of molecules. Beyond sequence representation, molecules exhibit two complementary structural views: the first focuses on the topological relationships between atoms, as exemplified by the graph view; and the second emphasizes the spatial configuration of molecules, as represented by the image view. The two types of views provide unique insights into molecular structures. To leverage these views collaboratively, we propose the CROss-view Prefixes (CROP) to enhance LLMs' molecular understanding through efficient multi-view integration. CROP possesses two advantages: (i) efficiency: by jointly resampling multiple structural views into fixed-length prefixes, it avoids excessive consumption of the LLM's limited context length and allows easy expansion to more views; (ii) effectiveness: by utilizing the LLM's self-encoded molecular sequences to guide the resampling process, it boosts the quality of the generated prefixes. Specifically, our framework features a carefully designed SMILES Guided Resampler for view resampling, and a Structural Embedding Gate for converting the resulting embeddings into LLM's prefixes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of CROP in tasks including molecule captioning, IUPAC name prediction and molecule property prediction.

      The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has resulted in increasingly sophisticated AI-generated content, posing significant challenges in distinguishing LLM-generated text from human-written language. Existing detection methods, primarily based on lexical heuristics or fine-tuned classifiers, often suffer from limited generalizability and are vulnerable to paraphrasing, adversarial perturbations, and cross-domain shifts. In this work, we propose SentiDetect, a model-agnostic framework for detecting LLM-generated text by analyzing the divergence in sentiment distribution stability. Our method is motivated by the empirical observation that LLM outputs tend to exhibit emotionally consistent patterns, whereas human-written texts display greater emotional variability. To capture this phenomenon, we define two complementary metrics: sentiment distribution consistency and sentiment distribution preservation, which quantify stability under sentiment-altering and semantic-preserving transformations. We evaluate SentiDetect on five diverse datasets and a range of advanced LLMs,including Gemini-1.5-Pro, Claude-3, GPT-4-0613, and LLaMa-3.3. Experimental results demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, with over 16% and 11% F1 score improvements on Gemini-1.5-Pro and GPT-4-0613, respectively. Moreover, SentiDetect also shows greater robustness to paraphrasing, adversarial attacks, and text length variations, outperforming existing detectors in challenging scenarios.

      Large language models (LLMs) are susceptible to generating inaccurate or false information, often referred to as "hallucinations" or "confabulations." While several technical advancements have been made to detect hallucinated content by assessing the factuality of the model's responses, there is still limited research on how to effectively communicate this information to users. To address this gap, we conducted two scenario-based experiments with a total of 208 participants to systematically compare the effects of various design strategies for communicating factuality scores by assessing participants' ratings of trust, ease in validating response accuracy, and preference. Our findings reveal that participants preferred and trusted a design in which all phrases within a response were color-coded based on factuality scores. Participants also found it easier to validate accuracy of the response in this style compared to a baseline with no style applied. Our study offers practical design guidelines for LLM application developers and designers, aimed at calibrating user trust, aligning with user preferences, and enhancing users' ability to scrutinize LLM outputs.

      Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing education, with LLM-based agents playing a key role in simulating student behavior. A major challenge in student simulation is modeling the diverse learning patterns of students at various cognitive levels. However, current LLMs, typically trained as ``helpful assistants'', target at generating perfect responses. As a result, they struggle to simulate students with diverse cognitive abilities, as they often produce overly advanced answers, missing the natural imperfections that characterize student learning and resulting in unrealistic simulations. To address this issue, we propose a training-free framework for student simulation. We begin by constructing a cognitive prototype for each student using a knowledge graph, which captures their understanding of concepts from past learning records. This prototype is then mapped to new tasks to predict student performance. Next, we simulate student solutions based on these predictions and iteratively refine them using a beam search method to better replicate realistic mistakes. To validate our approach, we construct the \texttt{Student\_100} dataset, consisting of $100$ students working on Python programming and $5,000$ learning records. Experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms baseline models, achieving $100\%$ improvement in simulation accuracy.

      As large language models (LLMs) increasingly adapt and personalize to diverse sets of users, there is an increased risk of systems appropriating sociolects, i.e., language styles or dialects that are associated with specific minoritized lived experiences (e.g., African American English, Queer slang). In this work, we examine whether sociolect usage by an LLM agent affects user reliance on its outputs and user perception (satisfaction, frustration, trust, and social presence). We designed and conducted user studies where 498 African American English (AAE) speakers and 487 Queer slang speakers performed a set of question-answering tasks with LLM-based suggestions in either standard American English (SAE) or their self-identified sociolect. Our findings showed that sociolect usage by LLMs influenced both reliance and perceptions, though in some surprising ways. Results suggest that both AAE and Queer slang speakers relied more on the SAE agent, and had more positive perceptions of the SAE agent. Yet, only Queer slang speakers felt more social presence from the Queer slang agent over the SAE one, whereas only AAE speakers preferred and trusted the SAE agent over the AAE one. These findings emphasize the need to test for behavioral outcomes rather than simply assume that personalization would lead to a better and safer reliance outcome. They also highlight the nuanced dynamics of minoritized language in machine interactions, underscoring the need for LLMs to be carefully designed to respect cultural and linguistic boundaries while fostering genuine user engagement and trust.

      Large language models (LLMs), despite their ability to perform few-shot machine translation (MT), often lag behind dedicated MT systems trained on parallel corpora, which are crucial for high quality machine translation (MT). However, parallel corpora are often scarce or non-existent for low-resource languages. In this paper, we propose CycleDistill, a bootstrapping approach leveraging LLMs and few-shot translation to obtain high-quality MT systems. CycleDistill involves iteratively generating synthetic parallel corpora from monolingual corpora via zero- or few-shot MT, which is then used to fine-tune the model that was used for generating said data for MT. CycleDistill does not need parallel corpora beyond 1 to 4 few-shot examples, and in our experiments focusing on three Indian languages, by relying solely on monolingual corpora, it can achieve high-quality machine translation, improving upon a few-shot baseline model by over 20-30 chrF points on average in the first iteration. We also study the effect of leveraging softmax activations during the distillation process and observe mild improvements in translation quality.

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) bring new potential to address this gap, with strong abilities in extracting and organizing diverse textual information. We therefore propose LSDTs (LLM-Augmented Semantic Digital Twins), a framework that helps LLMs extract planning knowledge from unstructured documents like environmental regulations and technical guidelines, and organize it into a formal ontology. This ontology forms a semantic layer that powers a digital twin-a virtual model of the physical system-allowing it to simulate realistic, regulation-aware planning scenarios. We evaluate LSDTs through a case study of offshore wind farm planning in Maryland, including its application during Hurricane Sandy. Results demonstrate that LSDTs support interpretable, regulation-aware layout optimization, enable high-fidelity simulation, and enhance adaptability in infrastructure planning.

      Collaboratively fine-tuning (FT) large language models (LLMs) over heterogeneous mobile devices fosters immense potential applications of personalized intelligence. However, such a vision faces critical system challenges. Conventional federated LLM FT approaches place prohibitive computational and memory burdens on mobile hardware, and their synchronous model aggregation protocols stall for slower devices. In this paper, we propose Fed MobiLLM, a novel design to facilitate efficient federated LLM FT across mobile devices with diverse computing/communication speeds and local model architectures. In particular, Fed MobiLLM implements a pioneering server-assisted federated side-tuning paradigm. Briefly, mobile devices perform lightweight forward propagation computations on local data using their frozen pre-scaled backbone LLMs, and then upload selected intermediate activations. The server trains a shared side-network independently, eliminating client-side backpropagation and enabling asynchronous updates. To bridge model heterogeneity across different devices, we introduce an adaptive layer-wise feature alignment method, which ensures consistent representations for collaboratively tuning a shared side network. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Fed MobiLLM can maintain robust fine-tuning performance while achieving extremely low on-device memory, with at least 95.2% reduction in computation overhead, 93.2% reduction in communication costs and 5.1x faster convergence compared to existing methods, validating its efficacy for practical LLM adaptation over heterogeneous mobile devices.

      LLM-driven chatbots like ChatGPT have created large volumes of conversational data, but little is known about how user privacy expectations are evolving with this technology. We conduct a survey experiment with 300 US ChatGPT users to understand emerging privacy norms for sharing chatbot data. Our findings reveal a stark disconnect between user concerns and behavior: 82% of respondents rated chatbot conversations as sensitive or highly sensitive - more than email or social media posts - but nearly half reported discussing health topics and over one-third discussed personal finances with ChatGPT. Participants expressed strong privacy concerns (t(299) = 8.5, p < .01) and doubted their conversations would remain private (t(299) = -6.9, p < .01). Despite this, respondents uniformly rejected sharing personal data (search history, emails, device access) for improved services, even in exchange for premium features worth $200. To identify which factors influence appropriate chatbot data sharing, we presented participants with factorial vignettes manipulating seven contextual factors. Linear mixed models revealed that only the transmission factors such as informed consent, data anonymization, or the removal of personally identifiable information, significantly affected perceptions of appropriateness and concern for data access. Surprisingly, contextual factors including the recipient of the data (hospital vs. tech company), purpose (research vs. advertising), type of content, and geographic location did not show significant effects. Our results suggest that users apply consistent baseline privacy expectations to chatbot data, prioritizing procedural safeguards over recipient trustworthiness. This has important implications for emerging agentic AI systems that assume user willingness to integrate personal data across platforms.

      There is a huge gap between numerous intriguing applications fostered by on-device large language model (LLM) fine-tuning (FT) from fresh mobile data and the limited resources of a mobile device. While existing server-assisted methods (e.g., split learning or side-tuning) may enable LLM FT on the local mobile device, they suffer from heavy communication burdens of activation transmissions, and may disclose data and labels to the server. To address those issues, we develop PAE MobiLLM, a a privacy-aware and efficient LLM FT method which can be deployed on the mobile device via server-assisted additive side-tuning. To further accelerate FT convergence and improve computing efficiency, PAE MobiLLM integrates activation caching on the server side, which allows the server to reuse historical activations and saves the mobile device from repeatedly computing forward passes for the recurring data samples. Besides, to reduce communication cost, PAE MobiLLM develops an activation shortcut that transmits only the token involved in the loss calculation instead of full activation matrices to guide the side network tuning. Last but not least, PAE MobiLLM introduces the additive adapter side-network design which makes the server train the adapter modules based on device-defined prediction differences rather than raw ground-truth labels. In this way, the server can only assist device-defined side-network computing, and learn nothing about data and labels. Extensive experimental results demonstrate PAE MobiLLM's superiority.

      Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed as scalable solutions to the global mental health crisis. But their deployment in psychiatric contexts raises a distinctive ethical concern: the problem of atypicality. Because LLMs generate outputs based on population-level statistical regularities, their responses -- while typically appropriate for general users -- may be dangerously inappropriate when interpreted by psychiatric patients, who often exhibit atypical cognitive or interpretive patterns. We argue that standard mitigation strategies, such as prompt engineering or fine-tuning, are insufficient to resolve this structural risk. Instead, we propose dynamic contextual certification (DCC): a staged, reversible and context-sensitive framework for deploying LLMs in psychiatry, inspired by clinical translation and dynamic safety models from artificial intelligence governance. DCC reframes chatbot deployment as an ongoing epistemic and ethical process that prioritises interpretive safety over static performance benchmarks. Atypicality, we argue, cannot be eliminated -- but it can, and must, be proactively managed.

      Long-context inference for Large Language Models (LLMs) is heavily limited by high computational demands. While several existing methods optimize attention computation, they still process the full set of hidden states at each layer, limiting overall efficiency. In this work, we propose SlimInfer, an innovative framework that aims to accelerate inference by directly pruning less critical prompt tokens during the forward pass. Our key insight is an information diffusion phenomenon: As information from critical tokens propagates through layers, it becomes distributed across the entire sequence. This diffusion process suggests that LLMs can maintain their semantic integrity when excessive tokens, even including these critical ones, are pruned in hidden states. Motivated by this, SlimInfer introduces a dynamic fine-grained pruning mechanism that accurately removes redundant tokens of hidden state at intermediate layers. This layer-wise pruning naturally enables an asynchronous KV cache manager that prefetches required token blocks without complex predictors, reducing both memory usage and I/O costs. Extensive experiments show that SlimInfer can achieve up to $\mathbf{2.53\times}$ time-to-first-token (TTFT) speedup and $\mathbf{1.88\times}$ end-to-end latency reduction for LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct on a single RTX 4090, without sacrificing performance on LongBench.

We evaluate whether minimal language-specific fine-tuning enables cross-lingual topic detection and whether adding targeted languages corrects pre-training biases. Results show that LLMs fine-tuned in one or two languages can reliably classify immigration-related content in unseen languages. However, identifying whether a tweet expresses a pro- or anti-immigration stance benefits from multilingual fine-tuning. Pre-training bias favours dominant languages, but even minimal exposure to under-represented languages during fine-tuning (as little as $9.62\times10^{-11}$ of the original pre-training token volume) yields significant gains. These findings challenge the assumption that cross-lingual mastery requires extensive multilingual training: limited language coverage suffices for topic-level generalisation, and structural biases can be corrected with lightweight interventions. By releasing 4-bit-quantised, LoRA fine-tuned models, we provide an open-source, reproducible alternative to proprietary LLMs that delivers 35 times faster inference at just 0.00000989% of the dollar cost of the OpenAI GPT-4o model, enabling scalable, inclusive research.

      Recent advancements in post-training Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly through Reinforcement Learning (RL) and preference optimization methods, are key drivers for enhancing their reasoning capabilities. However, these methods are often plagued by low sample efficiency and a susceptibility to primacy bias, where overfitting to initial experiences degrades policy quality and damages the learning process. To address these challenges, we introduce LLM optimization with Reset Replay (LoRR), a general and powerful plugin designed to enhance sample efficiency in any preference-based optimization framework. LoRR core mechanism enables training at a high replay number, maximizing the utility of each collected data batch. To counteract the risk of overfitting inherent in high-replay training, LoRR incorporates a periodic reset strategy with reusing initial data, which preserves network plasticity. Furthermore, it leverages a hybrid optimization objective, combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference-based losses to further bolster data exploitation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LoRR significantly boosts the performance of various preference optimization methods on both mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks. Notably, an iterative DPO approach augmented with LoRR achieves comparable performance on challenging math tasks, outperforming some complex and computationally intensive RL-based algorithms. These findings highlight that LoRR offers a practical, sample-efficient, and highly effective paradigm for LLM finetuning, unlocking greater performance from limited data.

      A chatbot's personality design is key to interaction quality. As chatbots evolved from rule-based systems to those powered by large language models (LLMs), evaluating the effectiveness of their personality design has become increasingly complex, particularly due to the open-ended nature of interactions. A recent and widely adopted method for assessing the personality design of LLM-based chatbots is the use of self-report questionnaires. These questionnaires, often borrowed from established human personality inventories, ask the chatbot to rate itself on various personality traits. Can LLM-based chatbots meaningfully "self-report" their personality? We created 500 chatbots with distinct personality designs and evaluated the validity of their self-report personality scores by examining human perceptions formed during interactions with these chatbots. Our findings indicate that the chatbot's answers on human personality scales exhibit weak correlations with both human-perceived personality traits and the overall interaction quality. These findings raise concerns about both the criterion validity and the predictive validity of self-report methods in this context. Further analysis revealed the role of task context and interaction in the chatbot's personality design assessment. We further discuss design implications for creating more contextualized and interactive evaluation.
