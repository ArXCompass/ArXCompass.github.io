    <details class="paper-abstract">
      There is a huge gap between numerous intriguing applications fostered by on-device large language model (LLM) fine-tuning (FT) from fresh mobile data and the limited resources of a mobile device. While existing server-assisted methods (e.g., split learning or side-tuning) may enable LLM FT on the local mobile device, they suffer from heavy communication burdens of activation transmissions, and may disclose data and labels to the server. To address those issues, we develop PAE MobiLLM, a a privacy-aware and efficient LLM FT method which can be deployed on the mobile device via server-assisted additive side-tuning. To further accelerate FT convergence and improve computing efficiency, PAE MobiLLM integrates activation caching on the server side, which allows the server to reuse historical activations and saves the mobile device from repeatedly computing forward passes for the recurring data samples. Besides, to reduce communication cost, PAE MobiLLM develops an activation shortcut that transmits only the token involved in the loss calculation instead of full activation matrices to guide the side network tuning. Last but not least, PAE MobiLLM introduces the additive adapter side-network design which makes the server train the adapter modules based on device-defined prediction differences rather than raw ground-truth labels. In this way, the server can only assist device-defined side-network computing, and learn nothing about data and labels. Extensive experimental results demonstrate PAE MobiLLM's superiority.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating code generation and software engineering tasks, yet they often struggle with complex, multi-file projects due to context limitations and knowledge gaps. We propose a novel context engineering workflow that combines multiple AI components: an Intent Translator (GPT-5) for clarifying user requirements, an Elicit-powered semantic literature retrieval for injecting domain knowledge, NotebookLM-based document synthesis for contextual understanding, and a Claude Code multi-agent system for code generation and validation. Our integrated approach leverages intent clarification, retrieval-augmented generation, and specialized sub-agents orchestrated via Claude's agent framework. We demonstrate that this method significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of code assistants in real-world repositories, yielding higher single-shot success rates and better adherence to project context than baseline single-agent approaches. Qualitative results on a large Next.js codebase show the multi-agent system effectively plans, edits, and tests complex features with minimal human intervention. We compare our system with recent frameworks like CodePlan, MASAI, and HyperAgent, highlighting how targeted context injection and agent role decomposition lead to state-of-the-art performance. Finally, we discuss the implications for deploying LLM-based coding assistants in production, along with lessons learned on context management and future research directions.

      The rapid rise of Generative AI (GenAI), particularly LLMs, poses concerns for journalistic integrity and authorship. This study examines AI-generated content across over 40,000 news articles from major, local, and college news media, in various media formats. Using three advanced AI-text detectors (e.g., Binoculars, Fast-Detect GPT, and GPTZero), we find substantial increase of GenAI use in recent years, especially in local and college news. Sentence-level analysis reveals LLMs are often used in the introduction of news, while conclusions usually written manually. Linguistic analysis shows GenAI boosts word richness and readability but lowers formality, leading to more uniform writing styles, particularly in local media.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Large language models (LLMs) are transforming social-science research by enabling scalable, precise analysis. Their adaptability raises the question of whether knowledge acquired through fine-tuning in a few languages can transfer to unseen languages that only appeared during pre-training. To examine this, we fine-tune lightweight LLaMA 3.2-3B models on monolingual, bilingual, or multilingual data sets to classify immigration-related tweets from X/Twitter across 13 languages, a domain characterised by polarised, culturally specific discourse. We evaluate whether minimal language-specific fine-tuning enables cross-lingual topic detection and whether adding targeted languages corrects pre-training biases. Results show that LLMs fine-tuned in one or two languages can reliably classify immigration-related content in unseen languages. However, identifying whether a tweet expresses a pro- or anti-immigration stance benefits from multilingual fine-tuning. Pre-training bias favours dominant languages, but even minimal exposure to under-represented languages during fine-tuning (as little as $9.62\times10^{-11}$ of the original pre-training token volume) yields significant gains. These findings challenge the assumption that cross-lingual mastery requires extensive multilingual training: limited language coverage suffices for topic-level generalisation, and structural biases can be corrected with lightweight interventions. By releasing 4-bit-quantised, LoRA fine-tuned models, we provide an open-source, reproducible alternative to proprietary LLMs that delivers 35 times faster inference at just 0.00000989% of the dollar cost of the OpenAI GPT-4o model, enabling scalable, inclusive research.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Recent advancements in post-training Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly through Reinforcement Learning (RL) and preference optimization methods, are key drivers for enhancing their reasoning capabilities. However, these methods are often plagued by low sample efficiency and a susceptibility to primacy bias, where overfitting to initial experiences degrades policy quality and damages the learning process. To address these challenges, we introduce LLM optimization with Reset Replay (LoRR), a general and powerful plugin designed to enhance sample efficiency in any preference-based optimization framework. LoRR core mechanism enables training at a high replay number, maximizing the utility of each collected data batch. To counteract the risk of overfitting inherent in high-replay training, LoRR incorporates a periodic reset strategy with reusing initial data, which preserves network plasticity. Furthermore, it leverages a hybrid optimization objective, combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference-based losses to further bolster data exploitation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LoRR significantly boosts the performance of various preference optimization methods on both mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks. Notably, an iterative DPO approach augmented with LoRR achieves comparable performance on challenging math tasks, outperforming some complex and computationally intensive RL-based algorithms. These findings highlight that LoRR offers a practical, sample-efficient, and highly effective paradigm for LLM finetuning, unlocking greater performance from limited data.

      A chatbot's personality design is key to interaction quality. As chatbots evolved from rule-based systems to those powered by large language models (LLMs), evaluating the effectiveness of their personality design has become increasingly complex, particularly due to the open-ended nature of interactions. A recent and widely adopted method for assessing the personality design of LLM-based chatbots is the use of self-report questionnaires. These questionnaires, often borrowed from established human personality inventories, ask the chatbot to rate itself on various personality traits. Can LLM-based chatbots meaningfully "self-report" their personality? We created 500 chatbots with distinct personality designs and evaluated the validity of their self-report personality scores by examining human perceptions formed during interactions with these chatbots. Our findings indicate that the chatbot's answers on human personality scales exhibit weak correlations with both human-perceived personality traits and the overall interaction quality. These findings raise concerns about both the criterion validity and the predictive validity of self-report methods in this context. Further analysis revealed the role of task context and interaction in the chatbot's personality design assessment. We further discuss design implications for creating more contextualized and interactive evaluation.

      The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has shown remarkable progress in complex reasoning tasks. However, a significant disparity exists between benchmark performances and real-world applications. We attribute this gap primarily to current evaluation protocols and metrics, which inadequately capture the full spectrum of LLM capabilities, especially in complex reasoning tasks where both accuracy and consistency are essential. In this paper, we introduce G-Pass@$k$, a novel evaluation metric that continuously assesses model performance across multiple sampling attempts, quantifying both the model's performance potential and its stability. Through extensive experiments on various public and newly constructed benchmarks, we employ G-Pass@$k$ in conjunction with state-of-the-art large language models to provide comprehensive insights into their potential capabilities and operational consistency. Our findings reveal a significant opportunity to enhance the realistic reasoning abilities of LLMs, underscoring the necessity for more robust evaluation metrics.

      AI for IT Operations (AIOps) is transforming how organizations manage complex software systems by automating anomaly detection, incident diagnosis, and remediation. Modern AIOps solutions increasingly rely on autonomous LLM-based agents to interpret telemetry data and take corrective actions with minimal human intervention, promising faster response times and operational cost savings. In this work, we perform the first security analysis of AIOps solutions, showing that, once again, AI-driven automation comes with a profound security cost. We demonstrate that adversaries can manipulate system telemetry to mislead AIOps agents into taking actions that compromise the integrity of the infrastructure they manage. We introduce techniques to reliably inject telemetry data using error-inducing requests that influence agent behavior through a form of adversarial reward-hacking; plausible but incorrect system error interpretations that steer the agent's decision-making. Our attack methodology, AIOpsDoom, is fully automated--combining reconnaissance, fuzzing, and LLM-driven adversarial input generation--and operates without any prior knowledge of the target system. To counter this threat, we propose AIOpsShield, a defense mechanism that sanitizes telemetry data by exploiting its structured nature and the minimal role of user-generated content. Our experiments show that AIOpsShield reliably blocks telemetry-based attacks without affecting normal agent performance. Ultimately, this work exposes AIOps as an emerging attack vector for system compromise and underscores the urgent need for security-aware AIOps design.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in role-playing conversations and providing emotional support as separate research directions. However, there remains a significant research gap in combining these capabilities to enable emotionally supportive interactions with virtual characters. To address this research gap, we focus on anime characters as a case study because of their well-defined personalities and large fan bases. This choice enables us to effectively evaluate how well LLMs can provide emotional support while maintaining specific character traits. We introduce ChatAnime, the first Emotionally Supportive Role-Playing (ESRP) dataset. We first thoughtfully select 20 top-tier characters from popular anime communities and design 60 emotion-centric real-world scenario questions. Then, we execute a nationwide selection process to identify 40 Chinese anime enthusiasts with profound knowledge of specific characters and extensive experience in role-playing. Next, we systematically collect two rounds of dialogue data from 10 LLMs and these 40 Chinese anime enthusiasts. To evaluate the ESRP performance of LLMs, we design a user experience-oriented evaluation system featuring 9 fine-grained metrics across three dimensions: basic dialogue, role-playing and emotional support, along with an overall metric for response diversity. In total, the dataset comprises 2,400 human-written and 24,000 LLM-generated answers, supported by over 132,000 human annotations. Experimental results show that top-performing LLMs surpass human fans in role-playing and emotional support, while humans still lead in response diversity. We hope this work can provide valuable resources and insights for future research on optimizing LLMs in ESRP. Our datasets are available at https://github.com/LanlanQiu/ChatAnime.

      Text-to-SQL bridges the gap between natural language and structured database language, thus allowing non-technical users to easily query databases. Traditional approaches model text-to-SQL as a direct translation task, where a given Natural Language Query (NLQ) is mapped to an SQL command. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved translation accuracy, however, these methods all require that the target database is pre-specified. This becomes problematic in scenarios with multiple extensive databases, where identifying the correct database becomes a crucial yet overlooked step. In this paper, we propose a three-stage end-to-end text-to-SQL framework to identify the user's intended database before generating SQL queries. Our approach leverages LLMs and prompt engineering to extract implicit information from natural language queries (NLQs) in the form of a ruleset. We then train a large db\_id prediction model, which includes a RoBERTa-based finetuned encoder, to predict the correct Database identifier (db\_id) based on both the NLQ and the LLM-generated rules. Finally, we refine the generated SQL by using critic agents to correct errors. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms the current state-of-the-art models in both database intent prediction and SQL generation accuracy.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely deployed in reasoning, planning, and decision-making tasks, making their trustworthiness a critical concern. The potential for intentional deception, where an LLM deliberately fabricates or conceals information to serve a hidden objective, remains a significant and underexplored threat. Existing studies typically induce such deception by explicitly setting a "hidden" objective through prompting or fine-tuning, which may not fully reflect real-world human-LLM interactions. Moving beyond this human-induced deception, we investigate LLMs' self-initiated deception on benign prompts. To address the absence of ground truth in this evaluation, we propose a novel framework using "contact searching questions." This framework introduces two statistical metrics derived from psychological principles to quantify the likelihood of deception. The first, the Deceptive Intention Score, measures the model's bias towards a hidden objective. The second, Deceptive Behavior Score, measures the inconsistency between the LLM's internal belief and its expressed output. Upon evaluating 14 leading LLMs, we find that both metrics escalate as task difficulty increases, rising in parallel for most models. Building on these findings, we formulate a mathematical model to explain this behavior. These results reveal that even the most advanced LLMs exhibit an increasing tendency toward deception when handling complex problems, raising critical concerns for the deployment of LLM agents in complex and crucial domains.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      In recent years, concerns about intellectual property (IP) in large language models (LLMs) have grown significantly. Plagiarizing other LLMs (through direct weight copying, upcycling, pruning, or continual pretraining) and claiming authorship without properly attributing to the original license, is a serious misconduct that can lead to significant financial and reputational harm to the original developers. However, existing methods for detecting LLM plagiarism fall short in key areas. They fail to accurately reconstruct weight correspondences, lack the ability to compute statistical significance measures such as $p$-values, and may mistakenly flag models trained on similar data as being related. To address these limitations, we propose Matrix-Driven Instant Review (MDIR), a novel method that leverages matrix analysis and Large Deviation Theory. MDIR achieves accurate reconstruction of weight relationships, provides rigorous $p$-value estimation, and focuses exclusively on weight similarity without requiring full model inference. Experimental results demonstrate that MDIR reliably detects plagiarism even after extensive transformations, such as random permutations and continual pretraining with trillions of tokens. Moreover, all detections can be performed on a single PC within an hour, making MDIR both efficient and accessible.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Ad-hoc instruction fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) is widely adopted for domain-specific adaptation. While domain-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is effective and efficient, it often weakens cross-domain generalization and struggles with noisy training data. To address these challenges, we propose DONOD, a lightweight model-intrinsic data pruning method. Our approach evaluates data using two model-parameter-based metrics: Delta of Norm (DON), which captures the cumulative influence on model weights, and Norm of Delta (NOD), which quantifies weight instability. Moreover, by employing the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) algorithm, we effectively filter noisy, unlearnable, and generalization-harming samples without relying on auxiliary models during the SFT process. Experiments on mathematical tasks demonstrate that data selected by DONOD achieves superior fine-tuning efficiency and improved robustness against noisy data. By filtering out 70% of the whole dataset, we improve target-domain accuracy by 14.90% and cross-domain accuracy by 5.67%. Meanwhile, our selected data present superior cross-architecture generalization. Data pruned by smaller models (e.g., Llama 3.1-8B) generalize effectively on larger models (e.g., Llama 2-13B). Compared to existing related methodologies, DONOD demonstrates comparable or superior performance while remaining dataset-agnostic, enabling broader applicability. Code will be made publicly available.

      Withtherapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), the context length for inference has been continuously increasing, leading to an exponential growth in the demand for Key-Value (KV) caching. This has resulted in a significant memory bottleneck, limiting the inference efficiency and scalability of the models. Therefore, optimizing the KV cache during inference is crucial for enhancing performance and efficiency. This review systematically examines current KV cache optimization techniques, including compression strategies such as selective token strategies, quantization, and attention compression. We evaluate the effectiveness, trade-offs, and application scenarios of these methods, providing a comprehensive analysis of their impact on memory usage and inference speed. We focus on identifying the limitations and challenges of existing methods, such as compatibility issues with different models and tasks. Additionally, this review highlights future research directions, including hybrid optimization techniques, adaptive dynamic strategies, and software-hardware co-design. These approaches aim to improve inference efficiency and promote the practical application of large language models.

      Students' mental well-being is vital for academic success, with activities such as studying, socializing, and sleeping playing a role. Current mobile sensing data highlight this intricate link using statistical and machine learning analyses. We propose a novel LLM agent-based simulation framework to model student activities and mental health using the StudentLife Dataset. Each LLM agent was initialized with personality questionnaires and guided by smartphone sensing data throughout the simulated semester. These agents predict individual behaviors, provide self-reported mental health data via ecological momentary assessments (EMAs), and complete follow-up personality questionnaires. To ensure accuracy, we investigated various prompting techniques, memory systems, and activity-based mental state management strategies that dynamically update an agent's mental state based on their daily activities. This simulation goes beyond simply replicating existing data. This allows us to explore new scenarios that are not present in the original dataset, such as peer influence through agent-to-agent interactions and the impact of social media. Furthermore, we can conduct intervention studies by manipulating activity patterns via sensing signals and personality traits using questionnaire responses. This provides valuable insights into the behavioral changes that could enhance student well-being. The framework also facilitates hypothetical interviews with LLM agents, offering deeper insights into their mental health. This study showcases the power of LLM-driven behavioral modeling with sensing data, opening new avenues for understanding and supporting student mental health.

      Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) expands the knowledge boundary of large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge bases, whose construction is often time-consuming and laborious. If an adversary extracts the knowledge base verbatim, it not only severely infringes the owner's intellectual property but also enables the adversary to replicate the application's functionality for unfair competition. Previous works on knowledge base extraction are limited either by low extraction coverage (usually less than 4%) in query-based attacks or by impractical assumptions of white-box access in embedding-based optimization methods. In this work, we propose CopyBreakRAG, an agent-based black-box attack that reasons from feedback and adaptively generates new adversarial queries for progressive extraction. By balancing exploration and exploitation through curiosity-driven queries and feedback-guided query refinement, our method overcomes the limitations of prior approaches and achieves significantly higher extraction coverage in realistic black-box settings. Experimental results show that CopyBreakRAG outperforms the state-of-the-art black-box approach by 45% on average in terms of chunk extraction ratio from applications built with mainstream RAG frameworks, and extracts over 70% of the data from the knowledge base in applications on commercial platforms including OpenAI's GPTs and ByteDance's Coze when essential protection is in place.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used as automated judges, where practical value depends on both accuracy and trustworthy, risk-aware judgments. Existing approaches predominantly focus on accuracy, overlooking the necessity of well-calibrated confidence, which is vital for adaptive and reliable evaluation pipelines. In this work, we advocate a shift from accuracy-centric evaluation to confidence-driven, risk-aware LLM-as-a-Judge systems, emphasizing the necessity of well-calibrated confidence for trustworthy and adaptive evaluation. We systematically identify the **Overconfidence Phenomenon** in current LLM-as-a-Judges, where predicted confidence significantly overstates actual correctness, undermining reliability in practical deployment. To quantify this phenomenon, we introduce **TH-Score**, a novel metric measuring confidence-accuracy alignment. Furthermore, we propose **LLM-as-a-Fuser**, an ensemble framework that transforms LLMs into reliable, risk-aware evaluators. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially improves calibration and enables adaptive, confidence-driven evaluation pipelines, achieving superior reliability and accuracy compared to existing baselines.

Using the Adaptive Semantic Fusion Algorithm (ASFA), heterogeneous medical data (including clinical reports and PubMed articles) and patient records dynamically generate a knowledge graph consisting of 15,964 nodes in 13 distinct types (e.g., diseases, symptoms, treatments, patient profiles) and 127,392 edges in 26 relationship types (e.g., causal, therapeutic, association). ASFA utilizes advanced probabilistic models, Bayesian inference, and graph optimization to extract semantic information, dynamically updating the graph with approximately 150 new nodes and edges in each data category while maintaining scalability with up to 987,654 edges. Real-world datasets, including MIMIC-III and PubMed, were utilized to evaluate the proposed architecture. The evaluation results show that DKG-LLM achieves a diagnostic accuracy of 84.19%. The model also has a treatment recommendation accuracy of 89.63% and a semantic coverage of 93.48%. DKG-LLM is a reliable and transformative tool that handles noisy data and complex multi-symptom diseases, along with feedback-based learning from physician input.

      To alleviate the memory bandwidth bottleneck in Large Language Model (LLM) inference workloads, weight matrices are stored in memory in quantized and sparsified formats. Hence, before tiles of these matrices can be processed by in-core generalized matrix multiplication (GeMM) hardware engines, they need to be dequantized and de-sparsified. This is currently performed in software with vector operations. Unfortunately, this approach delivers only modest performance. Moreover, it is hard to understand how to improve the system, as the overall GeMM performance depends on the interaction between memory resources, vector units, and hardware matrix engines. To improve the performance of LLM inference in advanced platforms equipped with in-core GeMM engines and HBM, this paper makes three main contributions. First, it develops an analytical performance model with a 3D visual representation that provides insights into how memory resources, vector units, and hardware matrix engines interact to deliver compressed GeMM performance. Second, it proposes DECA, a new near-core ML-model decompression accelerator. DECA offloads tile de-sparsification and dequantization from the CPU, producing ready-to-use tiles for in-core GeMM engines. Third, it introduces a new ISA extension that enables out-of-order invocation of the near-core accelerator. With this extension, accelerator and core computations can interleave and overlap with high-performance. Our evaluation shows that, in a simulated 56-core Xeon 4 server with HBM, DECA accelerates the execution of compressed GeMMs by up to 4x over the use of optimized Intel software kernels. Further, DECA reduces the next-token generation time of Llama2-70B and OPT-66B by 1.6x-2.6x.

      Training large language models (LLMs) is often constrained by GPU memory limitations. To alleviate memory pressure, activation recomputation and data compression have been proposed as two major strategies. However, both approaches have limitations: recomputation introduces significant training overhead, while compression can lead to accuracy degradation and computational inefficiency when applied naively. In this paper, we propose Adacc, the first adaptive memory optimization framework that unifies activation recomputation and data compression to improve training efficiency for LLMs while preserving model accuracy. Unlike existing methods that apply static, rule-based strategies or rely solely on one technique, Adacc makes fine-grained, tensor-level decisions, dynamically selecting between recomputation, retention, and compression based on tensor characteristics and runtime hardware constraints. Adacc tackles three key challenges: (1) it introduces layer-specific compression algorithms that mitigate accuracy loss by accounting for outliers in LLM activations; (2) it employs a MILP-based scheduling policy to globally optimize memory strategies across layers; and (3) it integrates an adaptive policy evolution mechanism to update strategies during training in response to changing data distributions. Experimental results show that Adacc improves training throughput by 1.01x to 1.37x compared to state-of-the-art frameworks, while maintaining accuracy comparable to the baseline.

      Large language models (LLMs) often require vast amounts of text to effectively acquire new knowledge. While continuing pre-training on large corpora or employing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven successful, updating an LLM with only a few thousand or million tokens remains challenging. In this work, we investigate the task of injecting small, unstructured information into LLMs and its relation to the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon. We use a dataset of recent news -- ensuring no overlap with the model's pre-training data -- to evaluate the knowledge acquisition by probing the model with question-answer pairs related the learned information. Starting from a continued pre-training baseline, we explored different augmentation algorithms to generate synthetic data to improve the knowledge acquisition capabilities. Our experiments show that simply continuing pre-training on limited data yields modest improvements, whereas exposing the model to diverse textual variations significantly improves the learning of new facts -- particularly with methods that induce greater variability through diverse prompting. Furthermore, we shed light on the forgetting phenomenon in small-data regimes, illustrating the delicate balance between learning new content and retaining existing capabilities. We also confirm the sensitivity of RAG-based approaches for knowledge injection, which often lead to greater degradation on control datasets compared to parametric methods. Finally, we demonstrate that models can generate effective synthetic training data themselves, suggesting a pathway toward self-improving model updates. All code and generated data used in our experiments are publicly available, providing a resource for studying efficient knowledge injection in LLMs with limited data at https://github.com/hugoabonizio/knowledge-injection-methods.

      The paper reconceptualizes pragmatics not as a subordinate, third dimension of meaning, but as a dynamic interface through which language operates as a socially embedded tool for action. With the emergence of large language models (LLMs) in communicative contexts, this understanding needs to be further refined and methodologically reconsidered. The first section challenges the traditional semiotic trichotomy, arguing that connectionist LLM architectures destabilize established hierarchies of meaning, and proposes the Human-Machine Communication (HMC) framework as a more suitable alternative. The second section examines the tension between human-centred pragmatic theories and the machine-centred nature of LLMs. While traditional, Gricean-inspired pragmatics continue to dominate, it relies on human-specific assumptions ill-suited to predictive systems like LLMs. Probabilistic pragmatics, particularly the Rational Speech Act framework, offers a more compatible teleology by focusing on optimization rather than truth-evaluation. The third section addresses the issue of substitutionalism in three forms - generalizing, linguistic, and communicative - highlighting the anthropomorphic biases that distort LLM evaluation and obscure the role of human communicative subjects. Finally, the paper introduces the concept of context frustration to describe the paradox of increased contextual input paired with a collapse in contextual understanding, emphasizing how users are compelled to co-construct pragmatic conditions both for the model and themselves. These arguments suggest that pragmatic theory may need to be adjusted or expanded to better account for communication involving generative AI.

      Recent studies have discovered that large language models (LLM) may be ``fooled'' to output private information, including training data, system prompts, and personally identifiable information, under carefully crafted adversarial prompts. Existing red-teaming approaches for privacy leakage either rely on manual efforts or focus solely on system prompt extraction, making them ineffective for severe risks of training data leakage. We propose LeakAgent, a novel black-box red-teaming framework for LLM privacy leakage. Our framework trains an open-source LLM through reinforcement learning as the attack agent to generate adversarial prompts for both training data extraction and system prompt extraction. To achieve this, we propose a novel reward function to provide effective and fine-grained rewards and design novel mechanisms to balance exploration and exploitation during learning and enhance the diversity of adversarial prompts. Through extensive evaluations, we first show that LeakAgent significantly outperforms existing rule-based approaches in training data extraction and automated methods in system prompt leakage. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of LeakAgent in extracting system prompts from real-world applications in OpenAI's GPT Store. We further demonstrate LeakAgent's effectiveness in evading the existing guardrail defense and its helpfulness in enabling better safety alignment. Finally, we validate our customized designs through a detailed ablation study. We release our code here https://github.com/rucnyz/LeakAgent.

      We study the problem of serving LLM (Large Language Model) requests where each request has heterogeneous prefill and decode lengths. In LLM serving, the prefill length corresponds to the input prompt length, which determines the initial memory usage in the KV cache. The decode length refers to the number of output tokens generated sequentially, with each additional token increasing the KV cache memory usage by one unit. Given a set of n requests, our goal is to schedule and process them to minimize the total completion time. We show that this problem is NP-hard due to the interplay of batching, placement constraints, precedence relationships, and linearly increasing memory usage. We then analyze commonly used scheduling strategies in practice, such as First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) and Shortest-First (SF), and prove that their competitive ratios scale up sublinearly with the memory limit-a significant drawback in real-world settings where memory demand is large. To address this, we propose a novel algorithm based on a new selection metric that efficiently forms batches over time. We prove that this algorithm achieves a constant competitive ratio. Finally, we develop and evaluate a few algorithm variants inspired by this approach, including dynamic programming variants, local search methods, and an LP-based scheduler, demonstrating through comprehensive simulations that they outperform standard baselines while maintaining computational efficiency.

      Evaluating the capabilities and risks of foundation models is paramount, yet current methods demand extensive domain expertise, hindering their scalability as these models rapidly evolve. We introduce SKATE: a novel evaluation framework in which large language models (LLMs) compete by generating and solving verifiable tasks for one another. Our core insight is to treat evaluation as a game: models act as both task-setters and solvers, incentivized to create questions which highlight their own strengths while exposing others' weaknesses. SKATE offers several key advantages, balancing scalability, open-endedness, and objectivity. It is fully automated, data-free, and scalable, requiring no human input or domain expertise. By using verifiable tasks rather than LLM judges, scoring is objective. Unlike domain-limited programmatically-generated benchmarks (e.g. chess-playing or spatial reasoning), having LLMs creatively pose challenges enables open-ended and scalable evaluation. As a proof of concept, we introduce LLM-set code-output-prediction (COP) challenges as a verifiable and extensible framework in which to test our approach. Using a TrueSkill-based ranking system, we evaluate six frontier LLMs and find that: (1) weaker models can reliably differentiate and score stronger ones, (2) LLM-based systems are capable of self-preferencing behavior, generating questions that align with their own capabilities, and (3) SKATE automatically surfaces fine-grained capability differences between models. Our findings are an important step towards general, scalable evaluation frameworks which can keep pace with LLM progress.

      Time series forecasting aims to model temporal dependencies among variables for future state inference, holding significant importance and widespread applications in real-world scenarios. Although deep learning-based methods have achieved remarkable progress, they still exhibit suboptimal performance in long-term forecasting and data-scarce scenarios. Recent research demonstrates that large language models (LLMs) achieve promising performance in time series forecasting. However, we find existing LLM-based methods still have shortcomings: (1) the absence of a unified paradigm for textual prompt formulation and (2) the neglect of modality discrepancies between textual prompts and time series. To address this, we propose LLM-Prompt, an LLM-based time series forecasting framework integrating multi-prompt information and cross-modal semantic alignment. Specifically, we first construct a unified textual prompt paradigm containing learnable soft prompts and textualized hard prompts. Second, to enhance LLMs' comprehensive understanding of the forecasting task, we design a semantic space embedding and cross-modal alignment module to achieve cross-modal fusion of temporal and textual information. Finally, the transformed time series from the LLMs are projected to obtain the forecasts. Comprehensive evaluations on 6 public datasets and 3 carbon emission datasets demonstrate that LLM-Prompt is a powerful framework for time series forecasting.

      Inductive program synthesis, or programming by example, requires synthesizing functions from input-output examples that generalize to unseen inputs. While large language model agents have shown promise in programming tasks guided by natural language, their ability to perform inductive program synthesis is underexplored. Existing evaluation protocols rely on static sets of examples and held-out tests, offering no feedback when synthesized functions are incorrect and failing to reflect real-world scenarios such as reverse engineering. We propose CodeARC, the Code Abstraction and Reasoning Challenge, a new evaluation framework where agents interact with a hidden target function by querying it with new inputs, synthesizing candidate functions, and iteratively refining their solutions using a differential testing oracle. This interactive setting encourages agents to perform function calls and self-correction based on feedback. We construct the first large-scale benchmark for general-purpose inductive program synthesis, featuring 1114 functions. Among 18 models evaluated, o3-mini performs best with a success rate of 52.7%, highlighting the difficulty of this task. Fine-tuning LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct on curated synthesis traces yields up to a 31% relative performance gain.

      Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized algorithm development, yet their application in symbolic regression, where algorithms automatically discover symbolic expressions from data, remains constrained and is typically designed manually by human experts. In this paper, we propose a meta learning framework that enables LLMs to automatically design selection operators for evolutionary symbolic regression algorithms. We first identify two key limitations in existing LLM-based algorithm evolution techniques: a lack of semantic guidance and code bloat. The absence of semantic awareness can lead to ineffective exchange of useful code components, and bloat results in unnecessarily complex components, both of which can reduce the interpretability of the designed algorithm or hinder evolutionary learning progress. To address these issues, we enhance the LLM-based evolution framework for meta symbolic regression with two key innovations: a complementary, semantics-aware selection operator and bloat control. Additionally, we embed domain knowledge into the prompt, enabling the LLM to generate more effective and contextually relevant selection operators. Our experimental results on symbolic regression benchmarks show that LLMs can devise selection operators that outperform nine expert-designed baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, the evolved operator can further improve the state-of-the-art symbolic regression algorithm, achieving the best performance among 26 symbolic regression and machine learning algorithms across 116 regression datasets. This demonstrates that LLMs can exceed expert-level algorithm design for symbolic regression.

We task LLMs with selecting project subsets under feasibility (e.g., budget) constraints via three prompting strategies: greedy selection, direct optimization, and a hill-climbing-inspired refinement. We benchmark LLMs' allocations against a utility-maximizing oracle. Interestingly, we also test whether LLMs can infer structured preferences from natural-language voter input or metadata, without explicit votes. By comparing allocations based on inferred preferences to those from ground-truth votes, we evaluate LLMs' ability to extract preferences from open-ended input. Our results underscore the role of prompt design and show that LLMs hold promise for mechanism design with unstructured inputs.

      The "LLM-as-an-annotator" and "LLM-as-a-judge" paradigms employ Large Language Models (LLMs) as annotators, judges, and evaluators in tasks traditionally performed by humans. LLM annotations are widely used, not only in NLP research but also in fields like medicine, psychology, and social science. Despite their role in shaping study results and insights, there is no standard or rigorous procedure to determine whether LLMs can replace human annotators. In this paper, we propose a novel statistical procedure, the Alternative Annotator Test (alt-test), that requires only a modest subset of annotated examples to justify using LLM annotations. Additionally, we introduce a versatile and interpretable measure for comparing LLM annotators and judges. To demonstrate our procedure, we curated a diverse collection of ten datasets, consisting of language and vision-language tasks, and conducted experiments with six LLMs and four prompting techniques. Our results show that LLMs can sometimes replace humans with closed-source LLMs (such as GPT-4o), outperforming the open-source LLMs we examine, and that prompting techniques yield judges of varying quality. We hope this study encourages more rigorous and reliable practices.

This is reflected in the simple arithmetic and control circuits currently used to evaluate generative capabilities in existing benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce ArchXBench, a six-level benchmark suite that encompasses complex arithmetic circuits and other advanced digital subsystems drawn from domains such as cryptography, image processing, machine learning, and signal processing.

Claim 2 shows that these nearest neighbor relationships are not arbitrary, as they are shared across models, but Claim 1 shows that they are not "obvious" either, as there is no single set of nearest neighbor relationships that is universally shared. Together, these suggest that LLMs generate a progression of activation geometries from layer to layer, but that this entire progression is largely shared between models, stretched and squeezed to fit into different architectures.

In contrast to conventional methods that rely on pre-scheduled action sequences or behavior trees, GhostShell drives embodied systems to act on-the-fly by issuing function calls incrementally as tokens are streamed from the LLM. GhostShell features a streaming XML function token parser, a dynamic function interface mapper, and a multi-channel scheduler that orchestrates intra-channel synchronous and inter-channel asynchronous function calls, thereby coordinating serial-parallel embodied actions across multiple robotic components under LLM guidance. We evaluate GhostShell on our robotic prototype COCO through comprehensive grounded experiments across 34 real-world interaction tasks and multiple LLM backends. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves a state-of-the-art Behavioral Correctness Metric of 0.85 with Claude-4-Sonnet, and up to 66X faster response times compared to native LLM function calling APIs. GhostShell also proves effective in long-horizon multimodal tasks, exhibiting strong robustness and generalization capabilities.

      Author-level citation metrics provide a practical, interpretable, and scalable signal of scholarly influence in a complex research ecosystem. It has been widely used as a proxy in hiring decisions. However, the past five years have seen the rapid emergence of large-scale publications in the field of large language models and foundation models, with papers featuring hundreds to thousands of co-authors and receiving tens of thousands of citations within months. For example, Gemini has 1361 authors and has been cited around 4600 times in 19 months. In such cases, traditional metrics, such as total citation count and the $h$-index, fail to meaningfully distinguish individual contributions. Therefore, we propose the following research question: How can one identify standout researchers among thousands of co-authors in large-scale LLM papers? This question is particularly important in scenarios such as academic hiring and funding decisions. In this paper, we introduce a novel citation metric designed to address this challenge by balancing contributions across large-scale and small-scale publications. We propose the SBCI index, analyze its theoretical properties, and evaluate its behavior on synthetic publication datasets. Our results demonstrate that the proposed metric provides a more robust and discriminative assessment of individual scholarly impact in the era of large-scale collaborations.

To bridge this gap and realize the potential of collaborative human-LLM action, this work explores human experience of LLM driven kinesthetic assistance. Specifically, we introduced an "Align-Analyze-Adjust" strategy and developed FlightAxis, a tool that integrates LLM with Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS) for flight skill acquisition, a representative operational skill domain. FlightAxis learns flight skills from manuals and guides forearm movements during simulated flight tasks. Our results demonstrate high user acceptance of LLM-mediated body control and significantly reduced task completion times. Crucially, trainees reported that this kinesthetic assistance enhanced their awareness of operation flaws and fostered increased engagement in the training process, rather than relieving perceived load. This work demonstrated the potential of kinesthetic LLM training in operational skill acquisition.

      Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation and structured reasoning; however, their performance often degrades on complex tasks that require consistent multi-step planning. Recent work has explored combining LLMs with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), yet existing approaches primarily focus on generating heuristic-based code for optimization or target simpler tasks where correctness alone is sufficient. In this work, we propose MCTS-OPS, a novel neural-symbolic framework that formulates prompt selection as a sequential decision process guided by MCTS. Our method explores and refines multi-step prompt sequences for the goal of improving code generation quality and enhancing the problem-solving capabilities of LLMs in general optimization. Experiments on network optimization show significant improvement over the baselines, both in the success rate of executing the generated code and in the optimization results with the specified objective and constraints (2$\sim$4$\times$ higher reward and 3$\times$ lower standard deviation). Moreover, it improves the chance of attaining the optimal solution by about 10\% of cases, compared to baseline methods in hard problems. These results highlight the promise of combining symbolic planning with LLMs for robust, high-quality code generation in complex domains.

      AMR (Abstract Meaning Representation) is a semantic formalism that encodes sentence meaning as rooted, directed, acyclic graphs, where nodes represent concepts and edges denote semantic relations. Finetuning decoder only Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a promising novel straightfoward direction for AMR parsing. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of finetuning four distinct LLM architectures, Phi 3.5, Gemma 2, LLaMA 3.2, and DeepSeek R1 LLaMA Distilled using the LDC2020T02 Gold AMR3.0 test set. Our results have shown that straightfoward finetuning of decoder only LLMs can achieve comparable performance to complex State of the Art (SOTA) AMR parsers. Notably, LLaMA 3.2 demonstrates competitive performance against SOTA AMR parsers given a straightforward finetuning approach. We achieved SMATCH F1: 0.804 on the full LDC2020T02 test split, on par with APT + Silver (IBM) at 0.804 and approaching Graphene Smatch (MBSE) at 0.854. Across our analysis, we also observed a consistent pattern where LLaMA 3.2 leads in semantic performance while Phi 3.5 excels in structural validity.

      There is growing interest in integrating high-fidelity visual synthesis capabilities into large language models (LLMs) without compromising their strong reasoning capabilities. Existing methods that directly train LLMs or bridge LLMs and diffusion models usually suffer from costly training since the backbone LLMs have not seen image representations during pretraining. We present Bifrost-1, a unified framework that bridges pretrained multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and diffusion models using patch-level CLIP image embeddings as latent variables, which are natively aligned with the MLLM's CLIP visual encoder. These patch-level image embeddings are integrated into the diffusion model with a lightweight adaptation of its ControlNet. To retain the original multimodal reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, we equip the MLLM with a visual generation branch initialized from the original MLLM parameters when predicting the patch-level image embeddings. By seamlessly integrating pretrained MLLMs and diffusion models with patch-level CLIP latents, our framework enables high-fidelity controllable image generation with significant training efficiency. Our experiments demonstrate that Bifrost-1 achieves comparable or better performance than previous methods in terms of visual fidelity and multimodal understanding, with substantially lower compute during training. We also provide comprehensive ablation studies showing the effectiveness of our design choices.

      Using LLMs to give educational feedback to students for their assignments has attracted much attention in the AI in Education field. Yet, there is currently no large-scale open-source dataset of student assignments that includes detailed assignment descriptions, rubrics, and student submissions across various courses. As a result, research on generalisable methodology for automatic generation of effective and responsible educational feedback remains limited. In the current study, we constructed a large-scale dataset of Synthetic Computer science Assignments for LLM-generated Educational Feedback research (SCALEFeedback). We proposed a Sophisticated Assignment Mimicry (SAM) framework to generate the synthetic dataset by one-to-one LLM-based imitation from real assignment descriptions, student submissions to produce their synthetic versions. Our open-source dataset contains 10,000 synthetic student submissions spanning 155 assignments across 59 university-level computer science courses. Our synthetic submissions achieved BERTScore F1 0.84, PCC of 0.62 for assignment marks and 0.85 for length, compared to the corresponding real-world assignment dataset, while ensuring perfect protection of student private information. All these results of our SAM framework outperformed results of a naive mimicry method baseline. The LLM-generated feedback for our synthetic assignments demonstrated the same level of effectiveness compared to that of real-world assignment dataset. Our research showed that one-to-one LLM imitation is a promising method for generating open-source synthetic educational datasets that preserve the original dataset's semantic meaning and student data distribution, while protecting student privacy and institutional copyright. SCALEFeedback enhances our ability to develop LLM-based generalisable methods for offering high-quality, automated educational feedback in a scalable way.

      The use of LLM tutors to provide automated educational feedback to students on student assignment submissions has received much attention in the AI in Education field. However, the stochastic nature and tendency for hallucinations in LLMs can undermine both quality of learning experience and adherence to ethical standards. To address this concern, we propose a method that uses LLM feedback evaluators (DeanLLMs) to automatically and comprehensively evaluate feedback generated by LLM tutor for submissions on university assignments before it is delivered to students. This allows low-quality feedback to be rejected and enables LLM tutors to improve the feedback they generated based on the evaluation results. We first proposed a comprehensive evaluation framework for LLM-generated educational feedback, comprising six dimensions for feedback content, seven for feedback effectiveness, and three for hallucination types. Next, we generated a virtual assignment submission dataset covering 85 university assignments from 43 computer science courses using eight commonly used commercial LLMs. We labelled and open-sourced the assignment dataset to support the fine-tuning and evaluation of LLM feedback evaluators. Our findings show that o3-pro demonstrated the best performance in zero-shot labelling of feedback while o4-mini demonstrated the best performance in few-shot labelling of feedback. Moreover, GPT-4.1 achieved human expert level performance after fine-tuning (Accuracy 79.8%, F1-score 79.4%; human average Accuracy 78.3%, F1-score 82.6%). Finally, we used our best-performance model to evaluate 2,000 assignment feedback instances generated by 10 common commercial LLMs, 200 each, to compare the quality of feedback generated by different LLMs. Our LLM feedback evaluator method advances our ability to automatically provide high-quality and reliable educational feedback to students.

      The advent of ultra-low-bit LLM models (1/1.58/2-bit), which match the perplexity and end-task performance of their full-precision counterparts using the same model size, is ushering in a new era of LLM inference for resource-constrained environments such as edge devices and AI PCs. While these quantization advances promise models that are more cost-effective in terms of latency, memory, throughput, and energy consumption, the computational efficiency of state-of-the-art (SOTA) inference runtimes (e.g., bitnet.cpp) used to deploy them remains underexplored. In this work, we take a bottom-up approach: we first design and implement 1-bit and 2-bit microkernels optimized for modern CPUs, achieving peak computational efficiency across a variety of CPU platforms. We integrate these microkernels into a state-of-the-art LLM inference framework, namely PyTorch-TPP, and present end-to-end inference results with 2-bit models that outperform the current SOTA runtime bitnet.cpp by up to 2.2x, and deliver up to 7x speedup compared to the 16-bit model inference.

      Sellers at eBay are recommended keyphrases to bid on to enhance the performance of their advertising campaigns. The relevance of these keyphrases is crucial in avoiding the overcrowding of search systems with irrelevant items and maintaining a positive seller perception. It is essential that keyphrase recommendations align with both seller and Search judgments regarding auctions. Due to the difficulty in procuring negative human judgment at scale, employing LLM-as-a-judge to mimic seller judgment has been established as the norm in several studies. This study introduces a novel two-step LLM distillation process from a LLM-judge used to debias our Embedding Based Retrieval (EBR) model from the various biases that exist in click-data. We distill from an LLM teacher via a cross-encoder assistant into a bi-encoder student using a multi-task training approach, ultimately employing the student bi-encoder to retrieve relevant advertiser keyphrases.

      Large language models (LLMs) can serve as judges that offer rapid and reliable assessments of other LLM outputs. However, models may systematically assign overly favorable ratings to their own outputs, a phenomenon known as self-bias, which can distort evaluations of true model performance. Previous studies often conflate genuine differences in model quality with bias or incorrectly assume that evaluations from LLMs and humans follow the same rating distributions. In this work, we present a statistical framework that explicitly formalizes assumptions under which self-bias can be identified and estimated. Our method models the difference in the scoring distribution that LLM-as-a-judge assigns to its own completions compared to other models, while accounting for the underlying quality of the completions provided by an independent, third-party judge (e.g., humans). Our method reliably isolates and quantifies self-bias, even when models vary in ability, ensuring that genuine performance differences are not mistaken for self-bias. We conduct an empirical analysis of self-bias on a large dataset (>5000 prompt-completion pairs) consisting of expert human annotations and judgments from nine different LLM judges. We find that some models, such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, systematically assign higher scores to their own outputs. These models also display family-bias; systematically assigning higher ratings to outputs produced by other models of the same family. Our findings highlight potential pitfalls of using LLM judges and offer practical guidance to mitigate biases when interpreting automated evaluations.

To enable cost-effective, early-stage evaluation, we introduce a quality control assessment designed to test the viability of LLM-simulated opinions on Likert-scale tasks without requiring large-scale human data for validation. This assessment comprises two key tests: \emph{logical consistency} and \emph{alignment with stakeholder expectations}, offering a low-cost, domain-adaptable validation tool. We apply our quality control assessment to an opinion simulation task relevant to AI-assisted content moderation and fact-checking workflows -- a socially impactful use case -- and evaluate seven LLMs using a baseline prompt engineering method (backstory prompting), as well as fine-tuning and in-context learning variants. None of the models or methods pass the full assessment, revealing several failure modes. We conclude with a discussion of the risk management implications and release \texttt{TopicMisinfo}, a benchmark dataset with paired human and LLM annotations simulated by various models and approaches, to support future research.

      Open-weight AI systems offer unique benefits, including enhanced transparency, open research, and decentralized access. However, they are vulnerable to tampering attacks which can efficiently elicit harmful behaviors by modifying weights or activations. Currently, there is not yet a robust science of open-weight model risk management. Existing safety fine-tuning methods and other post-training techniques have struggled to make LLMs resistant to more than a few dozen steps of adversarial fine-tuning. In this paper, we investigate whether filtering text about dual-use topics from training data can prevent unwanted capabilities and serve as a more tamper-resistant safeguard. We introduce a multi-stage pipeline for scalable data filtering and show that it offers a tractable and effective method for minimizing biothreat proxy knowledge in LLMs. We pretrain multiple 6.9B-parameter models from scratch and find that they exhibit substantial resistance to adversarial fine-tuning attacks on up to 10,000 steps and 300M tokens of biothreat-related text -- outperforming existing post-training baselines by over an order of magnitude -- with no observed degradation to unrelated capabilities. However, while filtered models lack internalized dangerous knowledge, we find that they can still leverage such information when it is provided in context (e.g., via search tool augmentation), demonstrating a need for a defense-in-depth approach. Overall, these findings help to establish pretraining data curation as a promising layer of defense for open-weight AI systems.

      The conversational capabilities of large language models hold significant promise for enabling scalable and interactive tutoring. While prior research has primarily examined their capacity for Socratic questioning, it often overlooks a critical dimension: adaptively guiding learners based on their cognitive states. This study shifts focus from mere question generation to the broader instructional guidance capability. We ask: Can LLMs emulate expert tutors who dynamically adjust strategies in response to learners' understanding? To investigate this, we propose GuideEval, a benchmark grounded in authentic educational dialogues that evaluates pedagogical guidance through a three-phase behavioral framework: (1) Perception, inferring learner states; (2) Orchestration, adapting instructional strategies; and (3) Elicitation, stimulating proper reflections. Empirical findings reveal that existing LLMs frequently fail to provide effective adaptive scaffolding when learners exhibit confusion or require redirection. Furthermore, we introduce a behavior-guided finetuning strategy that leverages behavior-prompted instructional dialogues, significantly enhancing guidance performance. By shifting the focus from isolated content evaluation to learner-centered interaction, our work advocates a more dialogic paradigm for evaluating Socratic LLMs.

      Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed as scalable solutions to the global mental health crisis. But their deployment in psychiatric contexts raises a distinctive ethical concern: the problem of atypicality. Because LLMs generate outputs based on population-level statistical regularities, their responses -- while typically appropriate for general users -- may be dangerously inappropriate when interpreted by psychiatric patients, who often exhibit atypical cognitive or interpretive patterns. We argue that standard mitigation strategies, such as prompt engineering or fine-tuning, are insufficient to resolve this structural risk. Instead, we propose dynamic contextual certification (DCC): a staged, reversible and context-sensitive framework for deploying LLMs in psychiatry, inspired by clinical translation and dynamic safety models from artificial intelligence governance. DCC reframes chatbot deployment as an ongoing epistemic and ethical process that prioritises interpretive safety over static performance benchmarks. Atypicality, we argue, cannot be eliminated -- but it can, and must, be proactively managed.

      Long-context inference for Large Language Models (LLMs) is heavily limited by high computational demands. While several existing methods optimize attention computation, they still process the full set of hidden states at each layer, limiting overall efficiency. In this work, we propose SlimInfer, an innovative framework that aims to accelerate inference by directly pruning less critical prompt tokens during the forward pass. Our key insight is an information diffusion phenomenon: As information from critical tokens propagates through layers, it becomes distributed across the entire sequence. This diffusion process suggests that LLMs can maintain their semantic integrity when excessive tokens, even including these critical ones, are pruned in hidden states. Motivated by this, SlimInfer introduces a dynamic fine-grained pruning mechanism that accurately removes redundant tokens of hidden state at intermediate layers. This layer-wise pruning naturally enables an asynchronous KV cache manager that prefetches required token blocks without complex predictors, reducing both memory usage and I/O costs. Extensive experiments show that SlimInfer can achieve up to $\mathbf{2.53\times}$ time-to-first-token (TTFT) speedup and $\mathbf{1.88\times}$ end-to-end latency reduction for LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct on a single RTX 4090, without sacrificing performance on LongBench.

      Prompting Large Language Models (LLMs), or providing context on the expected model of operation, is an effective way to steer the outputs of such models to satisfy human desiderata after they have been trained. But in rapidly evolving domains, there is often need to fine-tune LLMs to improve either the kind of knowledge in their memory or their abilities to perform open ended reasoning in new domains. When human's learn new concepts, we often do so by linking the new material that we are studying to concepts we have already learned before. To that end, we ask, "can prompting help us teach LLMs how to learn". In this work, we study a novel generalization of instruction tuning, called contextual fine-tuning, to fine-tune LLMs. Our method leverages instructional prompts designed to mimic human cognitive strategies in learning and problem-solving to guide the learning process during training, aiming to improve the model's interpretation and understanding of domain-specific knowledge. We empirically demonstrate that this simple yet effective modification improves the ability of LLMs to be fine-tuned rapidly on new datasets both within the medical and financial domains.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively tuned to mitigate explicit biases, yet they often exhibit subtle implicit biases rooted in their pre-training data. Rather than directly probing LLMs with human-crafted questions that may trigger guardrails, we propose studying how models behave when they proactively ask questions themselves. The 20 Questions game, a multi-turn deduction task, serves as an ideal testbed for this purpose. We systematically evaluate geographic performance disparities in entity deduction using a new dataset, Geo20Q+, consisting of both notable people and culturally significant objects (e.g., foods, landmarks, animals) from diverse regions. We test popular LLMs across two gameplay configurations (canonical 20-question and unlimited turns) and in seven languages (English, Hindi, Mandarin, Japanese, French, Spanish, and Turkish). Our results reveal geographic disparities: LLMs are substantially more successful at deducing entities from the Global North than the Global South, and the Global West than the Global East. While Wikipedia pageviews and pre-training corpus frequency correlate mildly with performance, they fail to fully explain these disparities. Notably, the language in which the game is played has minimal impact on performance gaps. These findings demonstrate the value of creative, free-form evaluation frameworks for uncovering subtle biases in LLMs that remain hidden in standard prompting setups. By analyzing how models initiate and pursue reasoning goals over multiple turns, we find geographic and cultural disparities embedded in their reasoning processes.

      Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive reasoning abilities on a wide range of complex tasks. However, enhancing these capabilities through post-training remains resource intensive, particularly in terms of data and computational cost. Although recent efforts have sought to improve sample efficiency through selective data curation, existing methods often rely on heuristic or task-specific strategies that hinder scalability. In this work, we introduce InfiAlign, a scalable and sample-efficient post-training framework that integrates supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align LLMs for enhanced reasoning. At the core of InfiAlign is a robust data selection pipeline that automatically curates high-quality alignment data from open-source reasoning datasets using multidimensional quality metrics. This pipeline enables significant performance gains while drastically reducing data requirements and remains extensible to new data sources. When applied to the Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base model, our SFT model achieves performance on par with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, while using only approximately 12% of the training data, and demonstrates strong generalization across diverse reasoning tasks. Additional improvements are obtained through the application of DPO, with particularly notable gains in mathematical reasoning tasks. The model achieves an average improvement of 3.89% on AIME 24/25 benchmarks. Our results highlight the effectiveness of combining principled data selection with full-stage post-training, offering a practical solution for aligning large reasoning models in a scalable and data-efficient manner.

      We develop mechanisms for evaluating AI systems without ground truth by exploiting a connection between gaming resistance and output quality. The data processing inequality ensures post-hoc attempts to game a metric degrades both information content and task performance. We prove that f-mutual information measures are the unique gaming resistant mechanisms under natural conditions, with the overseer acting as an agent. While Shannon mutual information faces exponential sample complexity, bounded measures like total variation distance remain tractable. Empirically, across ten domains from translation to peer review, all information-theoretic mechanisms achieve perfect discrimination (d > 0.5) between faithful and strategic agents. In contrast, LLM judges exhibit systematic evaluation inversion, preferring fabricated content over accurate summaries. Our mechanisms show 10-100x better robustness to adversarial manipulation than current practices. We also find performance follows an inverted-U curve with compression ratio, peaking at 10:1 where agent responses exhibit optimal information diversity (3 effective dimensions), giving a bias-variance perspective on when our approach is expected to be most effective.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in autonomous decision-making roles across high-stakes domains. However, since models are trained on human-generated data, they may inherit cognitive biases that systematically distort human judgment, including escalation of commitment, where decision-makers continue investing in failing courses of action due to prior investment. Understanding when LLMs exhibit such biases presents a unique challenge. While these biases are well-documented in humans, it remains unclear whether they manifest consistently in LLMs or require specific triggering conditions. This paper investigates this question using a two-stage investment task across four experimental conditions: model as investor, model as advisor, multi-agent deliberation, and compound pressure scenario. Across N = 6,500 trials, we find that bias manifestation in LLMs is highly context-dependent. In individual decision-making contexts (Studies 1-2, N = 4,000), LLMs demonstrate strong rational cost-benefit logic with minimal escalation of commitment. However, multi-agent deliberation reveals a striking hierarchy effect (Study 3, N = 500): while asymmetrical hierarchies show moderate escalation rates (46.2%), symmetrical peer-based decision-making produces near-universal escalation (99.2%). Similarly, when subjected to compound organizational and personal pressures (Study 4, N = 2,000), models exhibit high degrees of escalation of commitment (68.95% average allocation to failing divisions). These findings reveal that LLM bias manifestation depends critically on social and organizational context rather than being inherent, with significant implications for the deployment of multi-agent systems and unsupervised operations where such conditions may emerge naturally.

      Video large language models have achieved remarkable performance in tasks such as video question answering, however, their temporal understanding remains suboptimal. To address this limitation, we curate a dedicated instruction fine-tuning dataset that focuses on enhancing temporal comprehension across five key dimensions. In order to reduce reliance on costly temporal annotations, we introduce a multi-task prompt fine-tuning approach that seamlessly integrates temporal-sensitive tasks into existing instruction datasets without requiring additional annotations. Furthermore, we develop a novel benchmark for temporal-sensitive video understanding that not only fills the gaps in dimension coverage left by existing benchmarks but also rigorously filters out potential shortcuts, ensuring a more accurate evaluation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the temporal understanding of video-LLMs while avoiding reliance on shortcuts.

Comprising commercial LLMs with few-shot prompt engineering and vector knowledge base, QCopilot employs specialized agents to adaptively select optimization methods, automate modeling analysis, and independently perform problem diagnosis. Applying QCopilot to atom cooling experiments, we generated 10${}^{\rm{8}}$ sub-$\rm{\mu}$K atoms without any human intervention within a few hours, representing $\sim$100$\times$ speedup over manual experimentation. Notably, by continuously accumulating prior knowledge and enabling dynamic modeling, QCopilot can autonomously identify anomalous parameters in multi-parameter experimental settings.

      The growing demand for large-scale GPU clusters in distributed model training presents a significant barrier to innovation, particularly in model optimization, performance tuning, and system-level enhancements. To address this challenge, LLM training simulators are employed to estimate training time and guide design decisions. However, the state-of-the-art LLM training simulators assume homogeneous compute and network infrastructure. In practice, device heterogeneity is inevitable due to resource sharing in cloud environments, frequent shifts in device generations, and inherent intra-chip interconnect heterogeneity. To address the gap between state-of-the-art and practical requirements, we propose the design of a heterogeneity-aware distributed LLM simulator capable of predicting training time while enabling abstractions to specify custom configurations for device groups and device-to-parallelism mapping. We present the design requirements and challenges in building a heterogeneity-aware distributed ML training simulator, and design components such as non-uniform workload partitioning. Our initial simulation results demonstrate the impact of heterogeneity on the model computation and communication time.

However, empirical understanding of LLM behavior in open-ended, multi-agent settings especially those involving deliberation over legal and ethical dilemmas remains limited. We introduce NomicLaw, a structured multi-agent simulation where LLMs engage in collaborative law-making, responding to complex legal vignettes by proposing rules, justifying them, and voting on peer proposals. We quantitatively measure trust and reciprocity via voting patterns and qualitatively assess how agents use strategic language to justify proposals and influence outcomes. Experiments involving homogeneous and heterogeneous LLM groups demonstrate how agents spontaneously form alliances, betray trust, and adapt their rhetoric to shape collective decisions.

      Effective agent performance relies on the ability to compose tools and agents into effective workflows. However, progress in Large Language Model (LLM) planning and reasoning is limited by the scarcity of scalable, reliable evaluation data. This study addresses this limitation by identifying a suitable workflow domain for LLM application. I introduce NL2Flow, a fully automated system for parametrically generating planning problems, which are expressed in natural language, a structured intermediate representation, and formal PDDL, and rigorously evaluating the quality of generated plans. NL2Flow generates a dataset of 2296 low-difficulty problems in automated workflow generation and evaluates multiple open-sourced, instruct-tuned LLMs without task-specific optimization or architectural modifications. Results reveal that the highest performing model achieved 86% success in generating valid plans and 69% in generating optimal plans, specifically for problems with feasible plans. Regression analysis shows that the influence of problem characteristics on plan generation is contingent on both model and prompt design. To investigate the potential of LLMs as natural language-to-JSON translators for workflow definition, and to facilitate integration with downstream symbolic computation tools and a symbolic planner, I evaluated the LLM's translation performance on natural language workflow descriptions. I observed that translating natural language into a JSON representation of a workflow problem yielded a lower success rate than generating a plan directly, suggesting that unnecessary decomposition of the reasoning task may degrade performance and highlighting the benefit of models capable of reasoning directly from natural language to action. As LLM reasoning scales to increasingly complex problems, understanding the shifting bottlenecks and sources of error within these systems will be crucial.

      Monolithic serving with chunked prefill improves GPU utilization by batching prefill and decode together, but suffers from fine-grained phase interference. Engine-level prefill-decode (PD) disaggregation avoids interference but incurs higher hardware and coordination overhead. Prior intra-GPU disaggregation approaches multiplex prefill and decode within a single GPU, using SLO-based tuning guided by heuristics from offline profiling or reactive feedback loops. However, these methods respond reactively to performance issues rather than anticipating them, limiting adaptability under dynamic workloads. We ask: can we achieve proactive intra-GPU disaggregation that adapts effectively to dynamic workloads? The key challenge lies in managing the conflicting resource demands of prefill and decode under varying conditions. We first show that GPU resources exhibit diminishing returns -- beyond a saturation point, more allocation yields minimal latency benefit. Second, we observe that memory bandwidth contention becomes a critical bottleneck. These insights motivate a design that dynamically partitions GPU resources across prefill and decode phases, while jointly considering compute capacity, memory footprint, and bandwidth contention. Evaluated on diverse LLMs and workloads, our system Nexus achieves up to 2.2x higher throughput, 20x lower TTFT, and 2.5x lower TBT than vLLM; outperforms SGLang by up to 2x; and matches or exceeds disaggregated vLLM.

      We propose a hybrid architecture that integrates decision tree-based symbolic reasoning with the generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) within a coordinated multi-agent framework. Unlike prior approaches that loosely couple symbolic and neural modules, our design embeds decision trees and random forests as callable oracles within a unified reasoning system. Tree-based modules enable interpretable rule inference and causal logic, while LLM agents handle abductive reasoning, generalization, and interactive planning. A central orchestrator maintains belief state consistency and mediates communication across agents and external tools, enabling reasoning over both structured and unstructured inputs. The system achieves strong performance on reasoning benchmarks. On \textit{ProofWriter}, it improves entailment consistency by +7.2\% through logic-grounded tree validation. On GSM8k, it achieves +5.3\% accuracy gains in multistep mathematical problems via symbolic augmentation. On \textit{ARC}, it boosts abstraction accuracy by +6.0\% through integration of symbolic oracles. Applications in clinical decision support and scientific discovery show how the system encodes domain rules symbolically while leveraging LLMs for contextual inference and hypothesis generation. This architecture offers a robust, interpretable, and extensible solution for general-purpose neuro-symbolic reasoning.

      The Drawing Projection Test (DPT) is an essential tool in art therapy, allowing psychologists to assess participants' mental states through their sketches. Specifically, through sketches with the theme of "a person picking an apple from a tree (PPAT)", it can be revealed whether the participants are in mental states such as depression. Compared with scales, the DPT can enrich psychologists' understanding of an individual's mental state. However, the interpretation of the PPAT is laborious and depends on the experience of the psychologists. To address this issue, we propose an effective identification method to support psychologists in conducting a large-scale automatic DPT. Unlike traditional sketch recognition, DPT more focus on the overall evaluation of the sketches, such as color usage and space utilization. Moreover, PPAT imposes a time limit and prohibits verbal reminders, resulting in low drawing accuracy and a lack of detailed depiction. To address these challenges, we propose the following efforts: (1) Providing an experimental environment for automated analysis of PPAT sketches for depression assessment; (2) Offering a Visual-Semantic depression assessment based on LLM (VS-LLM) method; (3) Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves by 17.6% compared to the psychologist assessment method. We anticipate that this work will contribute to the research in mental state assessment based on PPAT sketches' elements recognition.

In contrast to conventional methods that rely on pre-scheduled action sequences or behavior trees, GhostShell drives embodied systems to act on-the-fly by issuing function calls incrementally as tokens are streamed from the LLM. GhostShell features a streaming XML function token parser, a dynamic function interface mapper, and a multi-channel scheduler that orchestrates intra-channel synchronous and inter-channel asynchronous function calls, thereby coordinating serial-parallel embodied actions across multiple robotic components as directed by the LLM. We evaluate GhostShell on our robot prototype COCO through comprehensive grounded experiments across 34 real-world interaction tasks and multiple LLMs. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art Behavioral Correctness Metric of 0.85 with Claude-4 Sonnet and up to 66X faster response times compared to LLM native function calling APIs. GhostShell also proves effective in long-horizon multimodal tasks, demonstrating strong robustness and generalization.

      Conversational recommender systems (CRS) based on Large Language Models (LLMs) need to constantly be aligned to the user preferences to provide satisfying and context-relevant item recommendations. The traditional supervised fine-tuning cannot capture the implicit feedback signal, e.g., dwell time, sentiment polarity, or engagement patterns. In this paper, we share a fine-tuning solution using human feedback reinforcement learning (RLHF) to maximize implied user feedback (IUF) in a multi-turn recommendation context. We specify a reward model $R_{\phi}$ learnt on weakly-labelled engagement information and maximize user-centric utility by optimizing the foundational LLM M_{\theta} through a proximal policy optimization (PPO) approach. The architecture models conversational state transitions $s_t \to a_t \to s_{t +1}$, where the action $a_t$ is associated with LLM-generated item suggestions only on condition of conversation history in the past. The evaluation across synthetic and real-world datasets (e.g.REDIAL, OpenDialKG) demonstrates that our RLHF-fine-tuned models can perform better in terms of top-$k$ recommendation accuracy, coherence, and user satisfaction compared to (arrow-zero-cmwrquca-teja-falset ensuite 2Round group-deca States penalty give up This paper shows that implicit signal alignment can be efficient in achieving scalable and user-adaptive design of CRS.

      Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the reliability of these reasoning chains remains a critical challenge. A widely held "cascading failure" hypothesis suggests that errors are most detrimental when they occur early in the reasoning process. This paper challenges that assumption through systematic error-injection experiments, revealing a counter-intuitive phenomenon we term "Late-Stage Fragility": errors introduced in the later stages of a CoT chain are significantly more likely to corrupt the final answer than identical errors made at the beginning. To address this specific vulnerability, we introduce the Adaptive Self-Correction Chain-of-Thought (ASCoT) method. ASCoT employs a modular pipeline in which an Adaptive Verification Manager (AVM) operates first, followed by the Multi-Perspective Self-Correction Engine (MSCE). The AVM leverages a Positional Impact Score function I(k) that assigns different weights based on the position within the reasoning chains, addressing the Late-Stage Fragility issue by identifying and prioritizing high-risk, late-stage steps. Once these critical steps are identified, the MSCE applies robust, dual-path correction specifically to the failure parts. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH demonstrate that ASCoT achieves outstanding accuracy, outperforming strong baselines, including standard CoT. Our work underscores the importance of diagnosing specific failure modes in LLM reasoning and advocates for a shift from uniform verification strategies to adaptive, vulnerability-aware correction mechanisms.

      Despite the promising potential of large language model (LLM) based register-transfer-level (RTL) code generation, the overall success rate remains unsatisfactory. Errors arise from various factors, with limited understanding of specific failure causes hindering improvement. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive error analysis and manual categorization. Our findings reveal that most errors stem not from LLM reasoning limitations, but from insufficient RTL programming knowledge, poor understanding of circuit concepts, ambiguous design descriptions, or misinterpretation of complex multimodal inputs. Leveraging in-context learning, we propose targeted error correction techniques. Specifically, we construct a domain-specific knowledge base and employ retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to supply necessary RTL knowledge. To mitigate ambiguity errors, we introduce design description rules and implement a rule-checking mechanism. For multimodal misinterpretation, we integrate external tools to convert inputs into LLM-compatible meta-formats. For remaining errors, we adopt an iterative debugging loop (simulation-error localization-correction). Integrating these techniques into an LLM-based framework significantly improves performance. We incorporate these error correction techniques into a foundational LLM-based RTL code generation framework, resulting in significantly improved performance. Experimental results show that our enhanced framework achieves 91.0\% accuracy on the VerilogEval benchmark, surpassing the baseline code generation approach by 32.7\%, demonstrating the effectiveness of our methods.

      The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has become a predominant paradigm for scaling large language models (LLMs). Despite offering strong performance and computational efficiency, large MoE-based LLMs like DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Kimi-K2-Instruct present serious challenges due to substantial memory requirements in deployment. While recent works have explored MoE compression to address this issue, existing methods often suffer from considerable accuracy drops (e.g., 7-14% relatively) even at modest compression rates. This paper introduces a novel Mixture-of-Basis-Experts (MoBE) method that achieves model compression while incurring minimal accuracy drops. Specifically, each up/gate matrix in an expert is decomposed via a rank decomposition as W = AB, where matrix A is unique to each expert. The relatively larger matrix B is further re-parameterized as a linear combination of basis matrices {Bi} shared across all experts within a given MoE layer. The factorization is learned by minimizing the reconstruction error relative to the original weight matrices. Experiments demonstrate that MoBE achieves notably lower accuracy drops compared to prior works. For instance, MoBE can reduce the parameter counts of Qwen3-235B-A22B-2507, DeepSeek-V3-0324 (671B) and Kimi-K2-Instruct (1T) by 24%-30% with only 1%-2% accuracy drop (about 2% drops when measured relatively).

However, collecting high-quality coding instructions is both labor-intensive and difficult to scale. On the other hand, code snippets are abundantly available from various sources. This imbalance presents a major bottleneck in instruction-based post-training. We propose CodeBoost, a post-training framework that enhances code LLMs purely from code snippets, without relying on human-annotated instructions. CodeBoost introduces the following key components: (1) maximum-clique curation, which selects a representative and diverse training corpus from code; (2) bi-directional prediction, which enables the model to learn from both forward and backward prediction objectives; (3) error-aware prediction, which incorporates learning signals from both correct and incorrect outputs; (4) heterogeneous augmentation, which diversifies the training distribution to enrich code semantics; and (5) heterogeneous rewarding, which guides model learning through multiple reward types including format correctness and execution feedback from both successes and failures.

To address this limitation, we introduce Cross-LoRA, a data-free framework for transferring LoRA modules between diverse base models without requiring additional training data. Cross-LoRA consists of two key components: (a) LoRA-Align, which performs subspace alignment between source and target base models through rank-truncated singular value decomposition (SVD) and Frobenius-optimal linear transformation, ensuring compatibility under dimension mismatch; and (b) LoRA-Shift, which applies the aligned subspaces to project source LoRA weight updates into the target model parameter space. Both components are data-free, training-free, and enable lightweight adaptation on a commodity GPU in 20 minutes. Experiments on ARCs, OBOA and HellaSwag show that Cross-LoRA achieves relative gains of up to 5.26% over base models.

This paper proposes utilizing prompt distillation, a self-distillation-based method previously explored primarily for style alignment and instruction tuning, to internalize new factual knowledge from free-form documents. Unlike prior methods, our approach requires neither larger teacher models nor structured knowledge formats.

      Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in handling spoken inputs for high-resource languages, reaching state-of-the-art performance in various tasks. However, their applicability is still less explored in low-resource settings. This work investigates the use of Speech LLMs for low-resource Automatic Speech Recognition using the SLAM-ASR framework, where a trainable lightweight projector connects a speech encoder and a LLM. Firstly, we assess training data volume requirements to match Whisper-only performance, re-emphasizing the challenges of limited data. Secondly, we show that leveraging mono- or multilingual projectors pretrained on high-resource languages reduces the impact of data scarcity, especially with small training sets. Using multilingual LLMs (EuroLLM, Salamandra) with whisper-large-v3-turbo, we evaluate performance on several public benchmarks, providing insights for future research on optimizing Speech LLMs for low-resource languages and multilinguality.

      With the rapid and continuous increase in academic publications, identifying high-quality research has become an increasingly pressing challenge. While recent methods leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated paper evaluation have shown great promise, they are often constrained by outdated domain knowledge and limited reasoning capabilities. In this work, we present PaperEval, a novel LLM-based framework for automated paper evaluation that addresses these limitations through two key components: 1) a domain-aware paper retrieval module that retrieves relevant concurrent work to support contextualized assessments of novelty and contributions, and 2) a latent reasoning mechanism that enables deep understanding of complex motivations and methodologies, along with comprehensive comparison against concurrently related work, to support more accurate and reliable evaluation. To guide the reasoning process, we introduce a progressive ranking optimization strategy that encourages the LLM to iteratively refine its predictions with an emphasis on relative comparison. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate that PaperEval consistently outperforms existing methods in both academic impact and paper quality evaluation. In addition, we deploy PaperEval in a real-world paper recommendation system for filtering high-quality papers, which has gained strong engagement on social media -- amassing over 8,000 subscribers and attracting over 10,000 views for many filtered high-quality papers -- demonstrating the practical effectiveness of PaperEval.

      Analog circuit design is a time-consuming, experience-driven task in chip development. Despite advances in AI, developing universal, fast, and stable gate sizing methods for analog circuits remains a significant challenge. Recent approaches combine Large Language Models (LLMs) with heuristic search techniques to enhance generalizability, but they often depend on large model sizes and lack portability across different technology nodes. To overcome these limitations, we propose EasySize, the first lightweight gate sizing framework based on a finetuned Qwen3-8B model, designed for universal applicability across process nodes, design specifications, and circuit topologies. EasySize exploits the varying Ease of Attainability (EOA) of performance metrics to dynamically construct task-specific loss functions, enabling efficient heuristic search through global Differential Evolution (DE) and local Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) within a feedback-enhanced flow. Although finetuned solely on 350nm node data, EasySize achieves strong performance on 5 operational amplifier (Op-Amp) netlists across 180nm, 45nm, and 22nm technology nodes without additional targeted training, and outperforms AutoCkt, a widely-used Reinforcement Learning based sizing framework, on 86.67\% of tasks with more than 96.67\% of simulation resources reduction. We argue that EasySize can significantly reduce the reliance on human expertise and computational resources in gate sizing, thereby accelerating and simplifying the analog circuit design process. EasySize will be open-sourced at a later date.

      Human cognition naturally engages with abstract and fluid concepts, whereas existing reasoning models often rely on generating discrete tokens, potentially constraining their expressive capabilities. Recent advancements aim to address this limitation by enabling large language models (LLMs) to generate soft, abstract tokens, thus facilitating reasoning within a continuous concept space. This paper explores the `Soft Thinking' capabilities of various LLMs by examining the models' internal behavior using a suite of probing techniques. Contrary to the common belief that Soft Thinking enables the simultaneous exploration of diverse reasoning paths, our findings reveal that LLMs predominantly rely on the most influential component of the soft inputs during subsequent decoding steps. This reliance hinders the exploration of different reasoning paths and reduces vanilla Soft Thinking to a form of greedy decoding, obscuring the advantage of transmitting more information through Soft Tokens. To tackle this issue, we explore sampling strategies to introduce \emph{randomness}, employing methods such as Dirichlet resampling and the Gumbel-Softmax trick. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating randomness can alleviate the limitations of vanilla approaches and unleash the potential of Soft Thinking. Notably, the Gumbel-Softmax trick provides adequate randomness with controlled smoothness, resulting in superior performance across eight reasoning benchmarks.

      Enhancing the capability of large language models (LLMs) in reasoning has gained significant attention in recent years. Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of various prompting strategies in aiding LLMs in reasoning (called "reasoning actions"), such as step-by-step thinking, reflecting before answering, solving with programs, and their combinations. However, these approaches often applied static, predefined reasoning actions uniformly to all questions, without considering the specific characteristics of each question or the capability of the task-solving LLM. In this paper, we propose DOTS, an approach enabling LLMs to reason dynamically via optimal reasoning trajectory search, tailored to the specific characteristics of each question and the inherent capability of the task-solving LLM. Our approach involves three key steps: i) defining atomic reasoning action modules that can be composed into various reasoning action trajectories; ii) searching for the optimal action trajectory for each training question through iterative exploration and evaluation for the specific task-solving LLM; and iii) using the collected optimal trajectories to train an LLM to plan for the reasoning trajectories of unseen questions. In particular, we propose two learning paradigms, i.e., fine-tuning an external LLM as a planner to guide the task-solving LLM, or directly fine-tuning the task-solving LLM with an internalized capability for reasoning actions planning. Our experiments across eight reasoning tasks show that our method consistently outperforms static reasoning techniques and the vanilla instruction tuning approach. Further analysis reveals that our method enables LLMs to adjust their computation based on problem complexity, allocating deeper thinking and reasoning to harder problems.

      Personalization of Large Language Models (LLMs) often assumes users hold static preferences that reflect globally in all tasks. In reality, humans hold dynamic preferences that change depending on the context. As users interact with an LLM in various contexts, they naturally reveal their contextual preferences, which a model must infer and apply in future contexts to ensure alignment. To assess this, we introduce CUPID, a benchmark of 756 human-curated interaction session histories between users and LLM-based chat assistants. In each interaction session, the user provides a request in a specific context and expresses their preference through multi-turn feedback. Given a new user request and prior interaction sessions, our benchmark assesses whether LLMs can infer the preference relevant to this request and generate a response that satisfies this preference. With CUPID, we evaluated 10 open and proprietary LLMs, revealing that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to infer preferences from multi-turn interactions and fail to discern what previous context is relevant to a new request -- under 50% precision and 65% recall. Our work highlights the need to advance LLM capabilities for more contextually personalized interactions and proposes CUPID as a resource to drive these improvements.

This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of finetuning four distinct LLM architectures, Phi 3.5, Gemma 2, LLaMA 3.2, and DeepSeek R1 LLaMA Distilled using the LDC2020T02 Gold AMR3.0 test set.

      While current LLM chatbots like GPT-4V bridge the gap between human instructions and visual representations to enable text-image generations, they still lack efficient alignment methods for high-fidelity performance on multiple downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose \textbf{$M^{2}Chat$}, a novel unified multimodal LLM framework for generating interleaved text-image conversation across various scenarios. Specifically, we propose an $M^{3}Adapter$ that efficiently integrates granular low-level visual information and high-level semantic features from multi-modality prompts. Upon the well-aligned fused feature, $M^{3}Adapter$ tailors a learnable gating strategy to balance the model creativity and consistency across various tasks adaptively. Moreover, to further enhance the effectiveness of $M^{3}Adapter$ while preserving the coherence of semantic context comprehension, we introduce a two-stage $M^{3}FT$ fine-tuning strategy. This strategy optimizes disjoint groups of parameters for image-text alignment and visual-instruction respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate our $M^{2}Chat$ surpasses state-of-the-art counterparts across diverse benchmarks, showcasing its prowess in interleaving generation, storytelling, and multimodal dialogue systems.

      Modern LLM pipelines increasingly resemble data-centric systems: they retrieve external context, compose intermediate outputs, validate results, and adapt based on runtime feedback. Yet, the central element guiding this process -- the prompt -- remains a brittle, opaque string, disconnected from the surrounding dataflow. This disconnect limits reuse, optimization, and runtime control. In this paper, we describe our vision and an initial design for SPEAR, a language and runtime that fills this prompt management gap by making prompts structured, adaptive, and first-class components of the execution model. SPEAR enables (1) runtime prompt refinement -- modifying prompts dynamically in response to execution-time signals such as confidence, latency, or missing context; and (2) structured prompt management -- organizing prompt fragments into versioned views with support for introspection and logging. SPEAR defines a prompt algebra that governs how prompts are constructed and adapted within a pipeline. It supports multiple refinement modes (manual, assisted, and automatic), giving developers a balance between control and automation. By treating prompt logic as structured data, SPEAR enables optimizations such as operator fusion, prefix caching, and view reuse. Preliminary experiments quantify the behavior of different refinement modes compared to static prompts and agentic retries, as well as the impact of prompt-level optimizations such as operator fusion.

      Self-evolving Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a scalable path toward super-intelligence by autonomously generating, refining, and learning from their own experiences. However, existing methods for training such models still rely heavily on vast human-curated tasks and labels, typically via fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, which poses a fundamental bottleneck to advancing AI systems toward capabilities beyond human intelligence. To overcome this limitation, we introduce R-Zero, a fully autonomous framework that generates its own training data from scratch. Starting from a single base LLM, R-Zero initializes two independent models with distinct roles, a Challenger and a Solver. These models are optimized separately and co-evolve through interaction: the Challenger is rewarded for proposing tasks near the edge of the Solver capability, and the Solver is rewarded for solving increasingly challenging tasks posed by the Challenger. This process yields a targeted, self-improving curriculum without any pre-existing tasks and labels. Empirically, R-Zero substantially improves reasoning capability across different backbone LLMs, e.g., boosting the Qwen3-4B-Base by +6.49 on math-reasoning benchmarks and +7.54 on general-domain reasoning benchmarks.

We discovered that participants value the system's ability to offer customized instructions based on context, provide extensive information beyond the recipe, and assist them in dynamic task planning. However, users expect the system to be more adaptive to oral conversation and provide more suggestive responses to keep them actively involved. Recognizing that users began treating our LLM-CA as a personal assistant or even a partner rather than just a recipe-reading tool, we propose five design considerations for future development.

      Traditionally, traders and quantitative analysts address alpha decay by manually crafting formulaic alphas, mathematical expressions that identify patterns or signals in financial data, through domain expertise and trial-and-error. This process is often time-consuming and difficult to scale. With recent advances in large language models (LLMs), it is now possible to automate the generation of such alphas by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. This paper introduces a novel framework that integrates a prompt-based LLM with a Transformer model for stock price prediction. The LLM first generates diverse and adaptive alphas using structured inputs such as historical stock features (Close, Open, High, Low, Volume), technical indicators, sentiment scores of both target and related companies. These alphas, instead of being used directly for trading, are treated as high-level features that capture complex dependencies within the financial data. To evaluate the effectiveness of these LLM-generated formulaic alphas, the alpha features are then fed into prediction models such as Transformer, LSTM, TCN, SVR, and Random Forest to forecast future stock prices. Experimental results demonstrate that the LLM-generated alphas significantly improve predictive accuracy. Moreover, the accompanying natural language reasoning provided by the LLM enhances the interpretability and transparency of the predictions, supporting more informed financial decision-making.

      We study 15 large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned for chat and find that their maximum softmax probabilities (MSPs) are consistently miscalibrated on multiple-choice Q&A. However, those MSPs might still encode useful uncertainty information. Specifically, we hypothesized that wrong answers would be associated with smaller MSPs compared to correct answers. Via rigorous statistical testing, we show that this hypothesis holds for models which perform well on the underlying Q&A task. We also find a strong direction correlation between Q&A accuracy and MSP correctness prediction, while finding no correlation between Q&A accuracy and calibration error. This suggests that within the current fine-tuning paradigm, we can expect correctness prediction but not calibration to improve as LLM capabilities progress. To demonstrate the utility of correctness prediction, we show that when models have the option to abstain, performance can be improved by selectively abstaining based on the MSP of the initial model response, using only a small amount of labeled data to choose the MSP threshold.

Unlike prior work focusing on sentiment or token-level comparisons, FiSCo goes beyond surface-level analysis by operating at the claim level, leveraging entailment checks to assess the consistency of meaning across responses. We decompose model outputs into semantically distinct claims and apply statistical hypothesis testing to compare inter- and intra-group similarities, enabling robust detection of subtle biases. We formalize a new group counterfactual fairness definition and validate FiSCo on both synthetic and human-annotated datasets spanning gender, race, and age. Experiments show that FiSco more reliably identifies nuanced biases while reducing the impact of stochastic LLM variability, outperforming various evaluation metrics.

Grid-Agent integrates semantic reasoning with numerical precision through a modular agent architecture: a planning agent generates coordinated action sequences using numerical power flow solvers, while a validation agent evaluates system stability and action effectiveness via sandboxed execution with safety rollbacks. To ensure scalability, Grid-Agent incorporates an adaptive multiscale network representation that dynamically selects optimal encoding schemes based on network size and complexity. The framework enables coordinated violation resolution through optimizing switch configurations, battery deployment, and load curtailment strategies. Experimental results in standard IEEE and CIGRE test systems (IEEE 69-bus, CIGRE MV, and IEEE 30-bus) demonstrate superior violation mitigation performance. Additionally, the framework's built-in data collection and learning capabilities enable continuous learning and adaptation to diverse network topologies. The autonomous nature of the framework makes it particularly suitable for modern smart grid applications requiring rapid response to dynamic operating conditions.

      Participatory Budgeting (PB) empowers citizens to propose and vote on public investment projects. Yet, despite its democratic potential, PB initiatives often suffer from low participation rates, limiting their visibility and perceived legitimacy. In this work, we aim to strengthen PB elections in two key ways: by supporting project proposers in crafting better proposals, and by helping PB organizers manage large volumes of submissions in a transparent manner. We propose a privacy-preserving approach to predict which PB proposals are likely to be funded, using only their textual descriptions and anonymous historical voting records -- without relying on voter demographics or personally identifiable information. We evaluate the performance of GPT 4 Turbo in forecasting proposal outcomes across varying contextual scenarios, observing that the LLM's prior knowledge needs to be complemented by past voting data to obtain predictions reflecting real-world PB voting behavior. Our findings highlight the potential of AI-driven tools to support PB processes by improving transparency, planning efficiency, and civic engagement.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have started to demonstrate the ability to persuade humans, yet our understanding of how this dynamic transpires is limited. Recent work has used linear probes, lightweight tools for analyzing model representations, to study various LLM skills such as the ability to model user sentiment and political perspective. Motivated by this, we apply probes to study persuasion dynamics in natural, multi-turn conversations. We leverage insights from cognitive science to train probes on distinct aspects of persuasion: persuasion success, persuadee personality, and persuasion strategy. Despite their simplicity, we show that they capture various aspects of persuasion at both the sample and dataset levels. For instance, probes can identify the point in a conversation where the persuadee was persuaded or where persuasive success generally occurs across the entire dataset. We also show that in addition to being faster than expensive prompting-based approaches, probes can do just as well and even outperform prompting in some settings, such as when uncovering persuasion strategy. This suggests probes as a plausible avenue for studying other complex behaviours such as deception and manipulation, especially in multi-turn settings and large-scale dataset analysis where prompting-based methods would be computationally inefficient.

      Capturing human learning behavior based on deep learning methods has become a major research focus in both psychology and intelligent systems. Recent approaches rely on controlled experiments or rule-based models to explore cognitive processes. However, they struggle to capture learning dynamics, track progress over time, or provide explainability. To address these challenges, we introduce LearnerAgent, a novel multi-agent framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate a realistic teaching environment. To explore human-like learning dynamics, we construct learners with psychologically grounded profiles-such as Deep, Surface, and Lazy-as well as a persona-free General Learner to inspect the base LLM's default behavior. Through weekly knowledge acquisition, monthly strategic choices, periodic tests, and peer interaction, we can track the dynamic learning progress of individual learners over a full-year journey. Our findings are fourfold: 1) Longitudinal analysis reveals that only Deep Learner achieves sustained cognitive growth. Our specially designed "trap questions" effectively diagnose Surface Learner's shallow knowledge. 2) The behavioral and cognitive patterns of distinct learners align closely with their psychological profiles. 3) Learners' self-concept scores evolve realistically, with the General Learner developing surprisingly high self-efficacy despite its cognitive limitations. 4) Critically, the default profile of base LLM is a "diligent but brittle Surface Learner"-an agent that mimics the behaviors of a good student but lacks true, generalizable understanding. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that LearnerAgent aligns well with real scenarios, yielding more insightful findings about LLMs' behavior.
