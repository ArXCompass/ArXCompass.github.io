    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Reasoning-intensive ranking models built on Large Language Models (LLMs) have made notable progress, but existing approaches often rely on large-scale LLMs and explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, resulting in high computational cost and latency that limit real-world use. To address this, we propose \textbf{TFRank}, an efficient pointwise reasoning ranker based on small-scale LLMs. To improve ranking performance, TFRank effectively integrates CoT data, fine-grained score supervision, and multi-task training. Furthermore, it achieves an efficient ``\textbf{T}hink-\textbf{F}ree" reasoning capability by employing a ``think-mode switch'' and pointwise format constraints. Specifically, this allows the model to leverage explicit reasoning during training while delivering precise relevance scores for complex queries at inference without generating any reasoning chains. Experiments show that TFRank (e.g., 1.7B) achieves performance comparable to models with four times more parameters on the BRIGHT benchmark, and demonstrates strong competitiveness on the BEIR benchmark. Further analysis shows that TFRank achieves an effective balance between performance and efficiency, providing a practical solution for integrating advanced reasoning into real-world systems. Our code and data are released in the repository: https://github.com/JOHNNY-fans/TFRank.

      This paper introduces AI Blob!, an experimental system designed to explore the potential of semantic cataloging and Large Language Models (LLMs) for the retrieval and recontextualization of archival television footage. Drawing methodological inspiration from Italian television programs such as Blob (RAI Tre, 1989-), AI Blob! integrates automatic speech recognition (ASR), semantic embeddings, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to organize and reinterpret archival content. The system processes a curated dataset of 1,547 Italian television videos by transcribing audio, segmenting it into sentence-level units, and embedding these segments into a vector database for semantic querying. Upon user input of a thematic prompt, the LLM generates a range of linguistically and conceptually related queries, guiding the retrieval and recombination of audiovisual fragments. These fragments are algorithmically selected and structured into narrative sequences producing montages that emulate editorial practices of ironic juxtaposition and thematic coherence. By foregrounding dynamic, content-aware retrieval over static metadata schemas, AI Blob! demonstrates how semantic technologies can facilitate new approaches to archival engagement, enabling novel forms of automated narrative construction and cultural analysis. The project contributes to ongoing debates in media historiography and AI-driven archival research, offering both a conceptual framework and a publicly available dataset to support further interdisciplinary experimentation.

    </div>
    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing tasks, but their massive size and computational demands hinder their deployment in resource-constrained environments. Existing model pruning methods address this issue by removing redundant structures (e.g., elements, channels, layers) from the model. However, these methods employ a heuristic pruning strategy, which leads to suboptimal performance. Besides, they also ignore the data characteristics when pruning the model. To overcome these limitations, we propose EvoP, an evolutionary pruning framework for robust LLM inference. EvoP first presents a cluster-based calibration dataset sampling (CCDS) strategy for creating a more diverse calibration dataset. EvoP then introduces an evolutionary pruning pattern searching (EPPS) method to find the optimal pruning pattern. Compared to existing model pruning techniques, EvoP achieves the best performance while maintaining the best efficiency. Experiments across different LLMs and different downstream tasks validate the effectiveness of the proposed EvoP, making it a practical and scalable solution for deploying LLMs in real-world applications.

      In this paper, we study the worst-case frontier risks of releasing gpt-oss. We introduce malicious fine-tuning (MFT), where we attempt to elicit maximum capabilities by fine-tuning gpt-oss to be as capable as possible in two domains: biology and cybersecurity. To maximize biological risk (biorisk), we curate tasks related to threat creation and train gpt-oss in an RL environment with web browsing. To maximize cybersecurity risk, we train gpt-oss in an agentic coding environment to solve capture-the-flag (CTF) challenges. We compare these MFT models against open- and closed-weight LLMs on frontier risk evaluations. Compared to frontier closed-weight models, MFT gpt-oss underperforms OpenAI o3, a model that is below Preparedness High capability level for biorisk and cybersecurity. Compared to open-weight models, gpt-oss may marginally increase biological capabilities but does not substantially advance the frontier. Taken together, these results contributed to our decision to release the model, and we hope that our MFT approach can serve as useful guidance for estimating harm from future open-weight releases.

      Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential in planning and reasoning tasks, offering a flexible alternative to classical pathfinding algorithms. However, most existing studies focus on LLMs' independent reasoning capabilities and overlook the potential synergy between LLMs and traditional algorithms. To fill this gap, we propose a comprehensive evaluation benchmark GridRoute to assess how LLMs can take advantage of traditional algorithms. We also propose a novel hybrid prompting technique called Algorithm of Thought (AoT), which introduces traditional algorithms' guidance into prompting. Our benchmark evaluates six LLMs ranging from 7B to 72B parameters across various map sizes, assessing their performance in correctness, optimality, and efficiency in grid environments with varying sizes. Our results show that AoT significantly boosts performance across all model sizes, particularly in larger or more complex environments, suggesting a promising approach to addressing path planning challenges.

      Cross-lingual aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) involves detailed sentiment analysis in a target language by transferring knowledge from a source language with available annotated data. Most existing methods depend heavily on often unreliable translation tools to bridge the language gap. In this paper, we propose a new approach that leverages a large language model (LLM) to generate high-quality pseudo-labelled data in the target language without the need for translation tools. First, the framework trains an ABSA model to obtain predictions for unlabelled target language data. Next, LLM is prompted to generate natural sentences that better represent these noisy predictions than the original text. The ABSA model is then further fine-tuned on the resulting pseudo-labelled dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method across six languages and five backbone models, surpassing previous state-of-the-art translation-based approaches. The proposed framework also supports generative models, and we show that fine-tuned LLMs outperform smaller multilingual models.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Despite the significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), catastrophic forgetting remains a substantial challenge, where models lose previously acquired knowledge upon learning new information. Continual learning (CL) strategies have emerged as a potential solution to this problem, with replay-based techniques demonstrating superior performance in preserving learned knowledge. In this context, we introduce Gauss-Tin, a novel approach that integrates the replay strategy with a Gaussian mixture model to enhance the quality of sample selection during training, supplemented by instructional guidance to facilitate the generation of past learning. This method aims to improve LLMs' retention capabilities by strategically reinforcing important past learnings while accommodating new information. Our experimental results indicate a promising 6\% improvement in retention metrics over traditional methods, suggesting that Gauss-Tin is an effective strategy for mitigating catastrophic forgetting in LLMs. This study underscores the potential of hybrid models in enhancing the robustness and adaptability of LLMs in dynamic learning environments.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Text-to-video retrieval answers user queries through searches based on concepts and embeddings. However, due to limitations in the size of the concept bank and the amount of training data, answering queries in the wild is not always effective because of the out-of-vocabulary problem. Furthermore, neither concept-based nor embedding-based search can perform reasoning to consolidate search results for complex queries that include logical and spatial constraints. To address these challenges, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to paraphrase queries using text-to-text (T2T), text-to-image (T2I), and image-to-text (I2T) transformations. These transformations rephrase abstract concepts into simpler terms to mitigate the out-of-vocabulary problem. Additionally, complex relationships within a query can be decomposed into simpler sub-queries, improving retrieval performance by effectively fusing the search results of these sub-queries. To mitigate the issue of LLM hallucination, this paper also proposes a novel consistency-based verification strategy to filter out factually incorrect paraphrased queries. Extensive experiments are conducted for ad-hoc video search and known-item search on the TRECVid datasets. We provide empirical insights into how traditionally difficult-to-answer queries can be effectively resolved through query paraphrasing.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      The long-context capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have been a hot topic in recent years. To evaluate the performance of LLMs in different scenarios, various assessment benchmarks have emerged. However, as most of these benchmarks focus on identifying key information to answer questions, which mainly requires the retrieval ability of LLMs, these benchmarks can partially represent the reasoning performance of LLMs from large amounts of information. Meanwhile, although LLMs often claim to have context windows of 32k, 128k, 200k, or even longer, these benchmarks fail to reveal the actual supported length of these LLMs. To address these issues, we propose the LongIns benchmark dataset, a challenging long-context instruction-based exam for LLMs, which is built based on the existing instruction datasets. Specifically, in our LongIns, we introduce three evaluation settings: Global Instruction & Single Task (GIST), Local Instruction & Single Task (LIST), and Local Instruction & Multiple Tasks (LIMT). Based on LongIns, we perform comprehensive evaluations on existing LLMs and have the following important findings: (1). The top-performing GPT-4 with 128k context length performs poorly on the evaluation context window of 16k in our LongIns. (2). For the multi-hop reasoning ability of many existing LLMs, significant efforts are still needed under short context windows (less than 4k).

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Ensuring robust safety alignment while preserving utility is critical for the reliable deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, current techniques fundamentally suffer from intertwined deficiencies: insufficient robustness against malicious attacks, frequent refusal of benign queries, degradation in generated text quality and general task performance--the former two reflecting deficits in robust safety and the latter constituting utility impairment. We trace these limitations to the coarse-grained layer-wise interventions in existing methods. To resolve this, we propose NeuronTune, a fine-grained framework that dynamically modulates sparse neurons to achieve simultaneous safety-utility optimization. Our approach first identifies safety-critical and utility-preserving neurons across all layers via attribution, then employs meta-learning to adaptively amplify safety-neuron activations and suppress utility-neuron activations. Crucially, NeuronTune enables tunable adjustment of intervention scope via neuron-count thresholds, supporting flexible adaptation to security-critical or utility-priority scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art technologies, achieving superior model safety while maintaining excellent utility.

      The wide deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) has given rise to strong demands for optimizing their inference performance. Today's techniques serving this purpose primarily focus on reducing latency and improving throughput through algorithmic and hardware enhancements, while largely overlooking their privacy side effects, particularly in a multi-user environment. In our research, for the first time, we discovered a set of new timing side channels in LLM systems, arising from shared caches and GPU memory allocations, which can be exploited to infer both confidential system prompts and those issued by other users. These vulnerabilities echo security challenges observed in traditional computing systems, highlighting an urgent need to address potential information leakage in LLM serving infrastructures. In this paper, we report novel attack strategies designed to exploit such timing side channels inherent in LLM deployments, specifically targeting the Key-Value (KV) cache and semantic cache widely used to enhance LLM inference performance. Our approach leverages timing measurements and classification models to detect cache hits, allowing an adversary to infer private prompts with high accuracy. We also propose a token-by-token search algorithm to efficiently recover shared prompt prefixes in the caches, showing the feasibility of stealing system prompts and those produced by peer users. Our experimental studies on black-box testing of popular online LLM services demonstrate that such privacy risks are completely realistic, with significant consequences. Our findings underscore the need for robust mitigation to protect LLM systems against such emerging threats.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Numerous benchmarks have been built to evaluate the domain-specific abilities of large language models (LLMs), highlighting the need for effective and efficient benchmark construction. Existing domain-specific benchmarks primarily focus on the scaling law, relying on massive corpora for supervised fine-tuning or generating extensive question sets for broad coverage. However, the impact of corpus and question-answer (QA) set design on the precision and recall of domain-specific LLMs remains unexplored. In this paper, we address this gap and demonstrate that the scaling law is not always the optimal principle for benchmark construction in specific domains. Instead, we propose Comp-Comp, an iterative benchmarking framework based on a comprehensiveness-compactness principle. Here, comprehensiveness ensures semantic recall of the domain, while compactness enhances precision, guiding both corpus and QA set construction. To validate our framework, we conducted a case study in a well-renowned university, resulting in the creation of XUBench, a large-scale and comprehensive closed-domain benchmark. Although we use the academic domain as the case in this work, our Comp-Comp framework is designed to be extensible beyond academia, providing valuable insights for benchmark construction across various domains.

      Internet of Things (IoT) sensors are ubiquitous technologies deployed across smart cities, industrial sites, and healthcare systems. They continuously generate time series data that enable advanced analytics and automation in industries. However, challenges such as the loss or ambiguity of sensor metadata, heterogeneity in data sources, varying sampling frequencies, inconsistent units of measurement, and irregular timestamps make raw IoT time series data difficult to interpret, undermining the effectiveness of smart systems. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep learning model, DeepFeatIoT, which integrates learned local and global features with non-learned randomized convolutional kernel-based features and features from large language models (LLMs). This straightforward yet unique fusion of diverse learned and non-learned features significantly enhances IoT time series sensor data classification, even in scenarios with limited labeled data. Our model's effectiveness is demonstrated through its consistent and generalized performance across multiple real-world IoT sensor datasets from diverse critical application domains, outperforming state-of-the-art benchmark models. These results highlight DeepFeatIoT's potential to drive significant advancements in IoT analytics and support the development of next-generation smart systems.

      Modern task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems increasingly rely on large language model (LLM) agents, leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and long-context capabilities for long-term memory utilization. However, these methods are primarily based on semantic similarity, overlooking task intent and reducing task coherence in multi-session dialogues. To address this challenge, we introduce MemGuide, a two-stage framework for intent-driven memory selection. (1) Intent-Aligned Retrieval matches the current dialogue context with stored intent descriptions in the memory bank, retrieving QA-formatted memory units that share the same goal. (2) Missing-Slot Guided Filtering employs a chain-of-thought slot reasoner to enumerate unfilled slots, then uses a fine-tuned LLaMA-8B filter to re-rank the retrieved units by marginal slot-completion gain. The resulting memory units inform a proactive strategy that minimizes conversational turns by directly addressing information gaps. Based on this framework, we introduce the MS-TOD, the first multi-session TOD benchmark comprising 132 diverse personas, 956 task goals, and annotated intent-aligned memory targets, supporting efficient multi-session task completion. Evaluations on MS-TOD show that MemGuide raises the task success rate by 11% (88% -> 99%) and reduces dialogue length by 2.84 turns in multi-session settings, while maintaining parity with single-session benchmarks.

      Scientific literature question answering is a pivotal step towards new scientific discoveries. Recently, \textit{two-stage} retrieval-augmented generated large language models (RAG-LLMs) have shown impressive advancements in this domain. Such a two-stage framework, especially the second stage (reranker), is particularly essential in the scientific domain, where subtle differences in terminology may have a greatly negative impact on the final factual-oriented or knowledge-intensive answers. Despite this significant progress, the potential and limitations of these works remain unexplored. In this work, we present a Scientific Rerank-oriented RAG Benchmark (SciRerankBench), for evaluating rerankers within RAG-LLMs systems, spanning five scientific subjects. To rigorously assess the reranker performance in terms of noise resilience, relevance disambiguation, and factual consistency, we develop three types of question-context-answer (Q-C-A) pairs, i.e., Noisy Contexts (NC), Semantically Similar but Logically Irrelevant Contexts (SSLI), and Counterfactual Contexts (CC). Through systematic evaluation of 13 widely used rerankers on five families of LLMs, we provide detailed insights into their relative strengths and limitations. To the best of our knowledge, SciRerankBench is the first benchmark specifically developed to evaluate rerankers within RAG-LLMs, which provides valuable observations and guidance for their future development.

      Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive reasoning abilities on a wide range of complex tasks. However, enhancing these capabilities through post-training remains resource intensive, particularly in terms of data and computational cost. Although recent efforts have sought to improve sample efficiency through selective data curation, existing methods often rely on heuristic or task-specific strategies that hinder scalability. In this work, we introduce InfiAlign, a scalable and sample-efficient post-training framework that integrates supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align LLMs for enhanced reasoning. At the core of InfiAlign is a robust data selection pipeline that automatically curates high-quality alignment data from open-source reasoning datasets using multidimensional quality metrics. This pipeline enables significant performance gains while drastically reducing data requirements and remains extensible to new data sources. When applied to the Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base model, our SFT model achieves performance on par with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, while using only approximately 12% of the training data, and demonstrates strong generalization across diverse reasoning tasks. Additional improvements are obtained through the application of DPO, with particularly notable gains in mathematical reasoning tasks. The model achieves an average improvement of 3.89% on AIME 24/25 benchmarks. Our results highlight the effectiveness of combining principled data selection with full-stage post-training, offering a practical solution for aligning large reasoning models in a scalable and data-efficient manner.

      Insider threats, which can lead to severe losses, remain a major security concern. While machine learning-based insider threat detection (ITD) methods have shown promising results, their progress is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality data. Enterprise data is sensitive and rarely accessible, while publicly available datasets, when limited in scale due to cost, lack sufficient real-world coverage; and when purely synthetic, they fail to capture rich semantics and realistic user behavior. To address this, we propose Chimera, the first large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent framework that automatically simulates both benign and malicious insider activities and collects diverse logs across diverse enterprise environments. Chimera models each employee with agents that have role-specific behavior and integrates modules for group meetings, pairwise interactions, and autonomous scheduling, capturing realistic organizational dynamics. It incorporates 15 types of insider attacks (e.g., IP theft, system sabotage) and has been deployed to simulate activities in three sensitive domains: technology company, finance corporation, and medical institution, producing a new dataset, ChimeraLog. We assess ChimeraLog via human studies and quantitative analysis, confirming its diversity, realism, and presence of explainable threat patterns. Evaluations of existing ITD methods show an average F1-score of 0.83, which is significantly lower than 0.99 on the CERT dataset, demonstrating ChimeraLog's higher difficulty and utility for advancing ITD research.

      Accurate molecular property prediction is a critical challenge with wide-ranging applications in chemistry, materials science, and drug discovery. Molecular representation methods, including fingerprints and graph neural networks (GNNs), achieve state-of-the-art results by effectively deriving features from molecular structures. However, these methods often overlook decades of accumulated semantic and contextual knowledge. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning abilities and prior knowledge across scientific domains, leading us to hypothesize that LLMs can generate rich molecular representations when guided to reason in multiple perspectives. To address these gaps, we propose $\text{M}^{2}$LLM, a multi-view framework that integrates three perspectives: the molecular structure view, the molecular task view, and the molecular rules view. These views are fused dynamically to adapt to task requirements, and experiments demonstrate that $\text{M}^{2}$LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks across classification and regression tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that representation derived from LLM achieves exceptional performance by leveraging two core functionalities: the generation of molecular embeddings through their encoding capabilities and the curation of molecular features through advanced reasoning processes.

      Transforming unstructured text into structured data is a complex task, requiring semantic understanding, reasoning, and structural comprehension. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential, they often struggle with handling ambiguous or domain-specific data, maintaining table structure, managing long inputs, and addressing numerical reasoning. This paper proposes an efficient system for LLM-driven text-to-table generation that leverages novel prompting techniques. Specifically, the system incorporates two key strategies: breaking down the text-to-table task into manageable, guided sub-tasks and refining the generated tables through iterative self-feedback. We show that this custom task decomposition allows the model to address the problem in a stepwise manner and improves the quality of the generated table. Furthermore, we discuss the benefits and potential risks associated with iterative self-feedback on the generated tables while highlighting the trade-offs between enhanced performance and computational cost. Our methods achieve strong results compared to baselines on two complex text-to-table generation datasets available in the public domain.

      Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence by enabling complex reasoning capabilities. While recent advancements in reinforcement learning (RL) have primarily focused on domain-specific reasoning tasks (e.g., mathematics or code generation), real-world reasoning scenarios often require models to handle diverse and complex environments that narrow-domain benchmarks cannot fully capture. To address this gap, we present InternBootcamp, an open-source framework comprising 1000+ domain-diverse task environments specifically designed for LLM reasoning research. Our codebase offers two key functionalities: (1) automated generation of unlimited training/testing cases with configurable difficulty levels, and (2) integrated verification modules for objective response evaluation. These features make InternBootcamp fundamental infrastructure for RL-based model optimization, synthetic data generation, and model evaluation. Although manually developing such a framework with enormous task coverage is extremely cumbersome, we accelerate the development procedure through an automated agent workflow supplemented by manual validation protocols, which enables the task scope to expand rapidly. % With these bootcamps, we further establish Bootcamp-EVAL, an automatically generated benchmark for comprehensive performance assessment. Evaluation reveals that frontier models still underperform in many reasoning tasks, while training with InternBootcamp provides an effective way to significantly improve performance, leading to our 32B model that achieves state-of-the-art results on Bootcamp-EVAL and excels on other established benchmarks. In particular, we validate that consistent performance gains come from including more training tasks, namely \textbf{task scaling}, over two orders of magnitude, offering a promising route towards capable reasoning generalist.

      E-commerce sellers are recommended keyphrases based on their inventory on which they advertise to increase buyer engagement (clicks/sales). The relevance of advertiser keyphrases plays an important role in preventing the inundation of search systems with numerous irrelevant items that compete for attention in auctions, in addition to maintaining a healthy seller perception. In this work, we describe the shortcomings of training Advertiser keyphrase relevance filter models on click/sales/search relevance signals and the importance of aligning with human judgment, as sellers have the power to adopt or reject said keyphrase recommendations. In this study, we frame Advertiser keyphrase relevance as a complex interaction between 3 dynamical systems -- seller judgment, which influences seller adoption of our product, Advertising, which provides the keyphrases to bid on, and Search, who holds the auctions for the same keyphrases. This study discusses the practicalities of using human judgment via a case study at eBay Advertising and demonstrate that using LLM-as-a-judge en-masse as a scalable proxy for seller judgment to train our relevance models achieves a better harmony across the three systems -- provided that they are bound by a meticulous evaluation framework grounded in business metrics.

      "Fedspeak", the stylized and often nuanced language used by the U.S. Federal Reserve, encodes implicit policy signals and strategic stances. The Federal Open Market Committee strategically employs Fedspeak as a communication tool to shape market expectations and influence both domestic and global economic conditions. As such, automatically parsing and interpreting Fedspeak presents a high-impact challenge, with significant implications for financial forecasting, algorithmic trading, and data-driven policy analysis. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based, uncertainty-aware framework for deciphering Fedspeak and classifying its underlying monetary policy stance. Technically, to enrich the semantic and contextual representation of Fedspeak texts, we incorporate domain-specific reasoning grounded in the monetary policy transmission mechanism. We further introduce a dynamic uncertainty decoding module to assess the confidence of model predictions, thereby enhancing both classification accuracy and model reliability. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the policy stance analysis task. Moreover, statistical analysis reveals a significant positive correlation between perceptual uncertainty and model error rates, validating the effectiveness of perceptual uncertainty as a diagnostic signal.

      Due to perceptions of efficiency and significant productivity gains, various organisations, including in education, are adopting Large Language Models (LLMs) into their workflows. Educator-facing, learner-facing, and institution-facing LLMs, collectively, Educational Large Language Models (eLLMs), complement and enhance the effectiveness of teaching, learning, and academic operations. However, their integration into an educational setting raises significant cybersecurity concerns. A comprehensive landscape of contemporary attacks on LLMs and their impact on the educational environment is missing. This study presents a generalised taxonomy of fifty attacks on LLMs, which are categorized as attacks targeting either models or their infrastructure. The severity of these attacks is evaluated in the educational sector using the DREAD risk assessment framework. Our risk assessment indicates that token smuggling, adversarial prompts, direct injection, and multi-step jailbreak are critical attacks on eLLMs. The proposed taxonomy, its application in the educational environment, and our risk assessment will help academic and industrial practitioners to build resilient solutions that protect learners and institutions.

      Digital Twins (DTs) offer powerful tools for managing complex infrastructure systems, but their effectiveness is often limited by challenges in integrating unstructured knowledge. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) bring new potential to address this gap, with strong abilities in extracting and organizing diverse textual information. We therefore propose LSDTs (LLM-Augmented Semantic Digital Twins), a framework that helps LLMs extract planning knowledge from unstructured documents like environmental regulations and technical guidelines, and organize it into a formal ontology. This ontology forms a semantic layer that powers a digital twin-a virtual model of the physical system-allowing it to simulate realistic, regulation-aware planning scenarios. We evaluate LSDTs through a case study of offshore wind farm planning in Maryland, including its application during Hurricane Sandy. Results demonstrate that LSDTs support interpretable, regulation-aware layout optimization, enable high-fidelity simulation, and enhance adaptability in infrastructure planning. This work shows the potential of combining generative AI with digital twins to support complex, knowledge-driven planning tasks.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically fine-tuned for reasoning tasks through a two-stage pipeline of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL), a process fraught with catastrophic forgetting and suboptimal trade-offs between imitation and exploration. Recent single-stage methods attempt to unify SFT and RL using heuristics, but lack a principled mechanism for dynamically balancing the two paradigms. In this paper, we reframe this challenge through the theoretical lens of \textbf{implicit rewards}, viewing SFT and RL not as distinct methods but as complementary reward signals. We introduce \textbf{Adaptive Meta Fine-Tuning (AMFT)}, a novel single-stage algorithm that learns the optimal balance between SFT's implicit, path-level reward and RL's explicit, outcome-based reward. The core of AMFT is a \textbf{meta-gradient adaptive weight controller} that treats the SFT-RL balance as a learnable parameter, dynamically optimizing it to maximize long-term task performance. This forward-looking approach, regularized by policy entropy for stability, autonomously discovers an effective training curriculum. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on challenging benchmarks spanning mathematical reasoning, abstract visual reasoning (General Points), and vision-language navigation (V-IRL). AMFT consistently establishes a new state-of-the-art and demonstrats superior generalization on out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. Ablation studies and training dynamic analysis confirm that the meta-learning controller is crucial for AMFT's stability, sample efficiency, and performance, offering a more principled and effective paradigm for LLM alignment.

      Balancing exploration and exploitation is a central goal in reinforcement learning (RL). Despite recent advances in enhancing large language model (LLM) reasoning, most methods lean toward exploitation, and increasingly encounter performance plateaus. In this work, we revisit entropy -- a signal of exploration in RL -- and examine its relationship to exploratory reasoning in LLMs. Through empirical analysis, we uncover positive correlations between high-entropy regions and three types of exploratory reasoning actions: (1) pivotal tokens that determine or connect logical steps, (2) reflective actions such as self-verification and correction, and (3) rare behaviors under-explored by the base LLMs. Motivated by this, we introduce a minimal modification to standard RL with only one line of code: augmenting the advantage function with an entropy-based term. Unlike traditional maximum-entropy methods which encourage exploration by promoting uncertainty, we encourage exploration by promoting longer and deeper reasoning chains. Notably, our method achieves significant gains on the Pass@K metric -- an upper-bound estimator of LLM reasoning capabilities -- even when evaluated with extremely large K values, pushing the boundaries of LLM reasoning.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing how users interact with information systems, yet their high inference cost poses serious scalability and sustainability challenges. Caching inference responses, allowing them to be retrieved without another forward pass through the LLM, has emerged as one possible solution. Traditional exact-match caching, however, overlooks the semantic similarity between queries, leading to unnecessary recomputation. Semantic caching addresses this by retrieving responses based on semantic similarity, but introduces a fundamentally different cache eviction problem: one must account for mismatch costs between incoming queries and cached responses. Moreover, key system parameters, such as query arrival probabilities and serving costs, are often unknown and must be learned over time. Existing semantic caching methods are largely ad-hoc, lacking theoretical foundations and unable to adapt to real-world uncertainty. In this paper, we present a principled, learning-based framework for semantic cache eviction under unknown query and cost distributions. We formulate both offline optimization and online learning variants of the problem, and develop provably efficient algorithms with state-of-the-art guarantees. We also evaluate our framework on a synthetic dataset, showing that our proposed algorithms perform matching or superior performance compared with baselines.

To address these limitations, we propose DynaSwarm, a dynamic framework that enhances LLM-based MAS through two key innovations: (1) an actor-critic reinforcement learning (A2C) mechanism to optimize graph structures with improved stability over prior RL methods, and (2) a dynamic graph selector that adaptively chooses the optimal graph structure for each input sample via parameter-efficient LLM fine-tuning. DynaSwarm eliminates the need for rigid, one-fits-all graph architectures, instead leveraging sample-specific idiosyncrasies to dynamically route queries through specialized agent networks.

Extensive experiments on question answering, mathematical reasoning, and coding tasks demonstrate that DynaSwarm consistently outperforms state-of-the-art single-agent and MAS baselines across multiple LLM backbones.

      Developers insert logging statements in source code to capture relevant runtime information essential for maintenance and debugging activities. Log level choice is an integral, yet tricky part of the logging activity as it controls log verbosity and therefore influences systems' observability and performance. Recent advances in ML-based log level prediction have leveraged large language models (LLMs) to propose log level predictors (LLPs) that demonstrated promising performance improvements (AUC between 0.64 and 0.8). Nevertheless, current LLM-based LLPs rely on randomly selected in-context examples, overlooking the structure and the diverse logging practices within modern software projects. In this paper, we propose OmniLLP, a novel LLP enhancement framework that clusters source files based on (1) semantic similarity reflecting the code's functional purpose, and (2) developer ownership cohesion. By retrieving in-context learning examples exclusively from these semantic and ownership aware clusters, we aim to provide more coherent prompts to LLPs leveraging LLMs, thereby improving their predictive accuracy. Our results show that both semantic and ownership-aware clusterings statistically significantly improve the accuracy (by up to 8\% AUC) of the evaluated LLM-based LLPs compared to random predictors (i.e., leveraging randomly selected in-context examples from the whole project). Additionally, our approach that combines the semantic and ownership signal for in-context prediction achieves an impressive 0.88 to 0.96 AUC across our evaluated projects. Our findings highlight the value of integrating software engineering-specific context, such as code semantic and developer ownership signals into LLM-LLPs, offering developers a more accurate, contextually-aware approach to logging and therefore, enhancing system maintainability and observability.

      Machine unlearning techniques aim to mitigate unintended memorization in large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches predominantly focus on the explicit removal of isolated facts, often overlooking latent inferential dependencies and the non-deterministic nature of knowledge within LLMs. Consequently, facts presumed forgotten may persist implicitly through correlated information. To address these challenges, we propose a knowledge unlearning evaluation framework that more accurately captures the implicit structure of real-world knowledge by representing relevant factual contexts as knowledge graphs with associated confidence scores. We further develop an inference-based evaluation protocol leveraging powerful LLMs as judges; these judges reason over the extracted knowledge subgraph to determine unlearning success. Our LLM judges utilize carefully designed prompts and are calibrated against human evaluations to ensure their trustworthiness and stability. Extensive experiments on our newly constructed benchmark demonstrate that our framework provides a more realistic and rigorous assessment of unlearning performance.

      Steering vectors (SVs) have emerged as a promising approach for interpreting and controlling LLMs, but current methods typically require large contrastive datasets that are often impractical to construct and may capture spurious correlations. We propose directly optimizing SVs through gradient descent on a single training example, and systematically investigate how these SVs generalize. We consider several SV optimization techniques and find that the resulting SVs effectively mediate safety-relevant behaviors in multiple models. Indeed, in experiments on an alignment-faking model, we are able to optimize one-shot SVs that induce harmful behavior on benign examples and whose negations suppress harmful behavior on malign examples. And in experiments on refusal suppression, we demonstrate that one-shot optimized SVs can transfer across inputs, yielding a Harmbench attack success rate of 96.9%. Furthermore, we extend work on "emergent misalignment" and show that SVs optimized to induce a model to write vulnerable code cause the model to respond harmfully on unrelated open-ended prompts. Finally, we use one-shot SV optimization to investigate how an instruction-tuned LLM recovers from outputting false information, and find that this ability is independent of the model's explicit verbalization that the information was false. Overall, our findings suggest that optimizing SVs on a single example can mediate a wide array of misaligned behaviors in LLMs. Code can be found at https://github.com/jacobdunefsky/one-shot-steering-repro and https://github.com/jacobdunefsky/one-shot-steering-misalignment.

We are interested in finetuning small, specialized LLMs for this purpose, but collecting datasets of task-program pairs specific to each robot is time-consuming and expensive. While approaches such as SELF-INSTRUCT and EVOL-INSTRUCT are capable of generating novel tasks given a few examples, they are unable to provide the corresponding programs that correctly abide by physical-world and robot-constraints using the provided programming interface. Using a simulator is a natural potential solution to checking for such constraints, but building simulation environments that can handle arbitrary tasks and their necessary objects and locations, is challenging. To address these challenges, we introduce ROBO-INSTRUCT, which synthesizes task-specific simulation environments on the fly during program execution, by opportunistically inferring entity properties and enforcing corresponding constraints based on how the entities are used in the task program. Additionally, ROBO-INSTRUCT integrates an LLM-aided post-processing procedure to refine instructions for better alignment with robot programs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ROBO-INSTRUCT across multiple LLMs, showing that our fine-tuned models outperform all baseline methods and even match or surpass the performance of several larger and proprietary models.

      Extensive compute and memory requirements limit the deployment of large language models (LLMs) on any hardware. Compression methods, such as pruning, can reduce model size, which in turn reduces resource requirements. State-of-the-art pruning is based on coarse-grained methods. They are time-consuming and inherently remove critical model parameters, adversely impacting the quality of the pruned model. This paper introduces projection pruning, a novel fine-grained method for pruning LLMs. In addition, LLM projection pruning is enhanced by a new approach we refer to as composite projection pruning - the synergistic combination of unstructured pruning that retains accuracy and structured pruning that reduces model size. We develop Mosaic, a novel system to create and deploy pruned LLMs using composite projection pruning. Mosaic is evaluated using a range of performance and quality metrics on multiple hardware platforms, LLMs, and datasets. Mosaic is 7.19x faster in producing models than existing approaches. Mosaic models achieve up to 84.2% lower perplexity and 31.4% higher accuracy than models obtained from coarse-grained pruning. Up to 67% faster inference and 68% lower GPU memory use is noted for Mosaic models. Mosaic is available for public use from https://github.com/blessonvar/Mosaic

Training LLMs on such unfiltered data risks perpetuating toxic behaviors, spreading misinformation, and amplifying societal biases which can undermine trust in LLM-driven applications and raise ethical concerns about their use. This paper presents a large-scale analysis of inappropriate content across these datasets, offering a comprehensive taxonomy that categorizes harmful webpages into Topical and Toxic based on their intent. We also introduce a prompt evaluation dataset, a high-accuracy Topical and Toxic Prompt (TTP), and a transformer-based model (HarmFormer) for harmful content filtering.

      Reasoning-augmented search agents such as Search-R1, trained via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), demonstrate remarkable capabilities in multi-step information retrieval from external knowledge sources. These agents address the limitations of their parametric memory by dynamically gathering relevant facts to address complex reasoning tasks. However, existing approaches suffer from a fundamental architectural limitation: they process search queries strictly sequentially, even when handling inherently parallelizable and logically independent comparisons. This sequential bottleneck significantly constrains computational efficiency, particularly for queries that require multiple entity comparisons. To address this critical limitation, we propose ParallelSearch, a novel reinforcement learning framework that empowers large language models (LLMs) to recognize parallelizable query structures and execute multiple search operations concurrently. Our approach introduces dedicated reward functions that incentivize the identification of independent query components while preserving answer accuracy through jointly considering correctness, query decomposition quality, and parallel execution benefits. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ParallelSearch outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by an average performance gain of 2.9% across seven question-answering benchmarks. Notably, on parallelizable questions, our method achieves a 12.7% performance improvement while requiring only 69.6% of the LLM calls compared to sequential approaches.

CIV provides deterministic, per-token non-interference guarantees on frozen models: lower-trust tokens cannot influence higher-trust representations. On benchmarks derived from recent taxonomies of prompt-injection vectors (Elite-Attack + SoK-246), CIV attains 0% attack success rate under the stated threat model while preserving 93.1% token-level similarity and showing no degradation in model perplexity on benign tasks; we note a latency overhead attributable to a non-optimized data path. Because CIV is a lightweight patch -- no fine-tuning required -- we demonstrate drop-in protection for Llama-3-8B and Mistral-7B. We release a reference implementation, an automated certification harness, and the Elite-Attack corpus to support reproducible research.

      Detecting vulnerabilities is vital for software security, yet deep learning-based vulnerability detectors (DLVD) face a data shortage, which limits their effectiveness. Data augmentation can potentially alleviate the data shortage, but augmenting vulnerable code is challenging and requires a generative solution that maintains vulnerability. Previous works have only focused on generating samples that contain single statements or specific types of vulnerabilities. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to solve various code generation and comprehension tasks with inspiring results, especially when fused with retrieval augmented generation (RAG). Therefore, we propose VulScribeR, a novel LLM-based solution that leverages carefully curated prompt templates to augment vulnerable datasets. More specifically, we explore three strategies to augment both single and multi-statement vulnerabilities, with LLMs, namely Mutation, Injection, and Extension. Our extensive evaluation across four vulnerability datasets and DLVD models, using three LLMs, show that our approach beats two SOTA methods Vulgen and VGX, and Random Oversampling (ROS) by 27.48%, 27.93%, and 15.41% in f1-score with 5K generated vulnerable samples on average, and 53.84%, 54.10%, 69.90%, and 40.93% with 15K generated vulnerable samples. Our approach demonstrates its feasibility for large-scale data augmentation by generating 1K samples at as cheap as US$ 1.88.

      Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have opened the door to in-depth investigation of their potential in tabular data modeling. However, effectively utilizing advanced LLMs in few-shot and even zero-shot scenarios is still challenging. To this end, we propose a novel LLM-based prototype estimation framework for tabular learning. Our key idea is to query the LLM to generate feature values based example-free prompt, which solely relies on task and feature descriptions. With the feature values generated by LLM, we can build a zero-shot prototype in a training-free manner, which can be further enhanced by fusing few-shot samples, avoiding training a classifier or finetuning the LLMs. Thanks to the example-free prompt and prototype estimation, ours bypasses the constraints brought by the example-based prompt, providing a scalable and robust framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ours in zero and few-shot tabular learning.

Targeting 5G Service-Based Architecture APIs, our approach achieves 85% reduction in communication overhead compared to manual discovery methods. Experimental validation using the open-source Phi-2 model demonstrates exceptional API call identification performance at 98-100% accuracy. The fine-tuned Phi-2 model delivers performance comparable to significantly larger models like GPT-4 while maintaining computational efficiency for telecommunications infrastructure deployment.

      While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation, they often produce solutions that lack guarantees of correctness, robustness, and efficiency. The limitation is acute in domains requiring strict constraints. FormalGrad introduces a principled framework that integrates formal methods directly into an iterative LLM-based generation loop. It uniquely treats code as a differentiable variable, converting structured feedback and formal constraints into a textual pseudo-gradient. This gradient guides the model to iteratively refine solutions, ensuring they are not only functional but also robust and formally justified. We evaluate FormalGrad on the HumanEval, HumanEval+, and LiveCodeBench benchmarks. Our implementation outperforms strong baselines, achieving an absolute improvement of up to 27% on HumanEval and a 41% relative improvement on the challenging LiveCodeBench V6. FormalGrad generates formally justified code that is robust and efficient, paving the way for reliable AI-assisted software development in high-stakes applications.

      Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications requiring complex, long-horizon workflows. However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on atomic tasks that are self-contained and independent, failing to capture the long-term contextual dependencies and multi-interaction coordination required in realistic scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce OdysseyBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLM agents on long-horizon workflows across diverse office applications including Word, Excel, PDF, Email, and Calendar. Our benchmark comprises two complementary splits: OdysseyBench+ with 300 tasks derived from real-world use cases, and OdysseyBench-Neo with 302 newly synthesized complex tasks. Each task requires agent to identify essential information from long-horizon interaction histories and perform multi-step reasoning across various applications. To enable scalable benchmark creation, we propose HomerAgents, a multi-agent framework that automates the generation of long-horizon workflow benchmarks through systematic environment exploration, task generation, and dialogue synthesis. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that OdysseyBench effectively challenges state-of-the-art LLM agents, providing more accurate assessment of their capabilities in complex, real-world contexts compared to existing atomic task benchmarks. We believe that OdysseyBench will serve as a valuable resource for advancing the development and evaluation of LLM agents in real-world productivity scenarios. In addition, we release OdysseyBench and HomerAgents to foster research along this line.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) generate tokens autoregressively, with each token depending on the preceding context. This sequential nature makes the inference process inherently difficult to accelerate, posing a significant challenge for efficient deployment. In recent years, various methods have been proposed to address this issue, with the most effective approaches often involving the training of additional draft models. In this paper, we introduce READER (Retrieval-Assisted Drafter for Efficient LLM Inference), a novel lossless speculative decoding method that enhances model-based approaches by leveraging self-repetitions in the text. Our algorithm expands the speculative decoding tree using tokens obtained through statistical search. This work focuses on large batch sizes (>= 8), an underexplored yet important area for industrial applications. We also analyze the key-value (KV) cache size during speculative decoding and propose an optimization to improve performance for large batches. As a result, READER outperforms existing speculative decoding methods. Notably, READER requires no additional training and can reuse pre-trained speculator models, increasing the speedup by over 40\%. Our method demonstrates particularly strong performance on search-based tasks, such as retrieval-augmented generation, where we achieve more than 10x speedup.

      Multi-agent large language model (LLM) systems have shown strong potential in complex reasoning and collaborative decision-making tasks. However, most existing coordination schemes rely on static or full-context routing strategies, which lead to excessive token consumption, redundant memory exposure, and limited adaptability across interaction rounds. We introduce RCR-Router, a modular and role-aware context routing framework designed to enable efficient, adaptive collaboration in multi-agent LLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first routing approach that dynamically selects semantically relevant memory subsets for each agent based on its role and task stage, while adhering to a strict token budget. A lightweight scoring policy guides memory selection, and agent outputs are iteratively integrated into a shared memory store to facilitate progressive context refinement. To better evaluate model behavior, we further propose an Answer Quality Score metric that captures LLM-generated explanations beyond standard QA accuracy. Experiments on three multi-hop QA benchmarks -- HotPotQA, MuSiQue, and 2WikiMultihop -- demonstrate that RCR-Router reduces token usage (up to 30%) while improving or maintaining answer quality. These results highlight the importance of structured memory routing and output-aware evaluation in advancing scalable multi-agent LLM systems.

      Although large language models (LLMs) hold significant promise in psychotherapy, their direct application in patient-facing scenarios raises ethical and safety concerns. Therefore, this work shifts towards developing an LLM as a supervisor to train real therapists. In addition to the privacy of clinical therapist training data, a fundamental contradiction complicates the training of therapeutic behaviors: clear feedback standards are necessary to ensure a controlled training system, yet there is no absolute "gold standard" for appropriate therapeutic behaviors in practice. In contrast, many common therapeutic mistakes are universal and identifiable, making them effective triggers for targeted feedback that can serve as clearer evidence. Motivated by this, we create a novel therapist-training paradigm: (1) guidelines for mistaken behaviors and targeted correction strategies are first established as standards; (2) a human-in-the-loop dialogue-feedback dataset is then constructed, where a mistake-prone agent intentionally makes standard mistakes during interviews naturally, and a supervisor agent locates and identifies mistakes and provides targeted feedback; (3) after fine-tuning on this dataset, the final supervisor model is provided for real therapist training. The detailed experimental results of automated, human and downstream assessments demonstrate that models fine-tuned on our dataset MATE, can provide high-quality feedback according to the clinical guideline, showing significant potential for the therapist training scenario.

      The rapid emergence of large language models (LLMs) has raised urgent questions across the modern workforce about this new technology's strengths, weaknesses, and capabilities. For privacy professionals, the question is whether these AI systems can provide reliable support on regulatory compliance, privacy program management, and AI governance. In this study, we evaluate ten leading open and closed LLMs, including models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Meta, and DeepSeek, by benchmarking their performance on industry-standard certification exams: CIPP/US, CIPM, CIPT, and AIGP from the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP). Each model was tested using official sample exams in a closed-book setting and compared to IAPP's passing thresholds. Our findings show that several frontier models such as Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI's GPT-5 consistently achieve scores exceeding the standards for professional human certification - demonstrating substantial expertise in privacy law, technical controls, and AI governance. The results highlight both the strengths and domain-specific gaps of current LLMs and offer practical insights for privacy officers, compliance leads, and technologists assessing the readiness of AI tools for high-stakes data governance roles.

Our defensive approach employs semantic-preserving output filtering through a secondary LLM to obfuscate model identity while maintaining semantic integrity. The defensive method reduces fingerprinting accuracy across tested models while preserving output quality. These contributions show the potential to improve fingerprinting tools capabilities while providing practical mitigation strategies against fingerprinting attacks.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      As large language models (LLMs) become more integrated into societal systems, the risk of them perpetuating and amplifying harmful biases becomes a critical safety concern. Traditional methods for mitigating bias often rely on data filtering or post-hoc output moderation, which treat the model as an opaque black box. In this work, we introduce a complete, end-to-end system that uses techniques from mechanistic interpretability to both identify and actively mitigate bias directly within a model's internal workings. Our method involves two primary stages. First, we train linear "probes" on the internal activations of a model to detect the latent representations of various biases (e.g., gender, race, age). Our experiments on \texttt{gpt2-large} demonstrate that these probes can identify biased content with near-perfect accuracy, revealing that bias representations become most salient in the model's later layers. Second, we leverage these findings to compute "steering vectors" by contrasting the model's activation patterns for biased and neutral statements. By adding these vectors during inference, we can actively steer the model's generative process away from producing harmful, stereotypical, or biased content in real-time. We demonstrate the efficacy of this activation steering technique, showing that it successfully alters biased completions toward more neutral alternatives. We present our work as a robust and reproducible system that offers a more direct and interpretable approach to building safer and more accountable LLMs.

      Prospect Theory (PT) models human decision-making under uncertainty, while epistemic markers (e.g., maybe) serve to express uncertainty in language. However, it remains largely unexplored whether Prospect Theory applies to contemporary Large Language Models and whether epistemic markers, which express human uncertainty, affect their decision-making behaviour. To address these research gaps, we design a three-stage experiment based on economic questionnaires. We propose a more general and precise evaluation framework to model LLMs' decision-making behaviour under PT, introducing uncertainty through the empirical probability values associated with commonly used epistemic markers in comparable contexts. We then incorporate epistemic markers into the evaluation framework based on their corresponding probability values to examine their influence on LLM decision-making behaviours. Our findings suggest that modelling LLMs' decision-making with PT is not consistently reliable, particularly when uncertainty is expressed in diverse linguistic forms.

      Generation-based fuzzing produces appropriate test cases according to specifications of input grammars and semantic constraints to test systems and software. However, these specifications require significant manual effort to construct. This paper proposes a new approach, ELFuzz (Evolution Through Large Language Models for Fuzzing), that automatically synthesizes generation-based fuzzers tailored to a system under test (SUT) via LLM-driven synthesis over fuzzer space. At a high level, it starts with minimal seed fuzzers and propels the synthesis by fully automated LLM-driven evolution with coverage guidance. Compared to previous approaches, ELFuzz can 1) seamlessly scale to SUTs of real-world sizes -- up to 1,791,104 lines of code in our evaluation -- and 2) synthesize efficient fuzzers that catch interesting grammatical structures and semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. Our evaluation compared ELFuzz with specifications manually written by domain experts and synthesized by state-of-the-art approaches. It shows that ELFuzz achieves up to 434.8% more coverage over the second best and triggers up to 216.7% more artificially injected bugs, compared to the state-of-the-art. We also used ELFuzz to conduct a real-world fuzzing campaign on the newest version of cvc5 for 14 days, and encouragingly, it found five 0-day bugs (three are exploitable). Moreover, we conducted an ablation study, which shows that the fuzzer space model, the key component of ELFuzz, contributes the most (up to 62.5%) to the effectiveness of ELFuzz. Further analysis of the fuzzers synthesized by ELFuzz confirms that they catch interesting grammatical structures and semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. The results present the promising potential of ELFuzz for more automated, efficient, and extensible input generation for fuzzing.

      LLM-based intelligent agents face significant deployment challenges, particularly related to resource management. Allowing unrestricted access to LLM or tool resources can lead to inefficient or even potentially harmful resource allocation and utilization for agents. Furthermore, the absence of proper scheduling and resource management mechanisms in current agent designs hinders concurrent processing and limits overall system efficiency. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the architecture of AIOS (LLM-based AI Agent Operating System) under the context of managing LLM-based agents. It introduces a novel architecture for serving LLM-based agents by isolating resources and LLM-specific services from agent applications into an AIOS kernel. This AIOS kernel provides fundamental services (e.g., scheduling, context management, memory management, storage management, access control) for runtime agents. To enhance usability, AIOS also includes an AIOS SDK, a comprehensive suite of APIs designed for utilizing functionalities provided by the AIOS kernel. Experimental results demonstrate that using AIOS can achieve up to 2.1x faster execution for serving agents built by various agent frameworks.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing tasks, but their massive size and computational demands hinder their deployment in resource-constrained environments. Existing model pruning methods address this issue by removing redundant structures (e.g., elements, channels, layers) from the model. However, these methods employ a heuristic pruning strategy, which leads to suboptimal performance. Besides, they also ignore the data characteristics when pruning the model. To overcome these limitations, we propose EvoP, an evolutionary pruning framework for robust LLM inference. EvoP first presents a cluster-based calibration dataset sampling (CCDS) strategy for creating a more diverse calibration dataset. EvoP then introduces an evolutionary pruning pattern searching (EPPS) method to find the optimal pruning pattern. Compared to existing model pruning techniques, EvoP achieves the best performance while maintaining the best efficiency. Experiments across different LLMs and different downstream tasks validate the effectiveness of the proposed EvoP, making it a practical and scalable solution for deploying LLMs in real-world applications.

      The increasing scale and complexity of large language models (LLMs) pose significant inference latency challenges, primarily due to their autoregressive decoding paradigm characterized by the sequential nature of next-token prediction. By re-examining the outputs of autoregressive models, we observed that some segments exhibit parallelizable structures, which we term intrinsic parallelism. Decoding each parallelizable branch simultaneously (i.e. parallel decoding) can significantly improve the overall inference speed of LLMs. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Serial-Parallel Decoding (ASPD), which addresses two core challenges: automated construction of parallelizable data and efficient parallel decoding mechanism. More specifically, we introduce a non-invasive pipeline that automatically extracts and validates parallelizable structures from the responses of autoregressive models. To empower efficient adaptive serial-parallel decoding, we implement a Hybrid Decoding Engine which enables seamless transitions between serial and parallel decoding modes while maintaining a reusable KV cache, maximizing computational efficiency. Extensive evaluations across General Tasks, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Mathematical Reasoning, demonstrate that ASPD achieves unprecedented performance in both effectiveness and efficiency. Notably, on Vicuna Bench, our method achieves up to 3.19x speedup (1.85x on average) while maintaining response quality within 1% difference compared to autoregressive models, realizing significant acceleration without compromising generation quality. Our framework sets a groundbreaking benchmark for efficient LLM parallel inference, paving the way for its deployment in latency-sensitive applications such as AI-powered customer service bots and answer retrieval engines.

      Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled their widespread use across diverse real-world applications. However, concerns remain about their tendency to encode and reproduce ideological biases, particularly along political and economic dimensions. In this paper, we propose a framework for probing and mitigating such biases in decoder-based LLMs through analysis of internal model representations. Grounded in the Political Compass Test (PCT), our method uses contrastive pairs to extract and compare hidden layer activations from models like Mistral and DeepSeek. We introduce a comprehensive activation extraction pipeline capable of layer-wise analysis across multiple ideological axes, revealing meaningful disparities linked to political framing. Our results show that decoder LLMs systematically encode representational bias across layers, which can be leveraged for effective steering vector-based mitigation. This work provides new insights into how political bias is encoded in LLMs and offers a principled approach to debiasing beyond surface-level output interventions.

      The rise of LLMs poses new possibilities in modeling opinion evolution, a long-standing task in simulation, by leveraging advanced reasoning abilities to recreate complex, large-scale human cognitive trends. While most prior works focus on opinion evolution surrounding specific isolated events or the views within a country, ours is the first to model the large-scale attitude evolution of a population representing an entire country towards another -- US citizens' perspectives towards China. To tackle the challenges of this broad scenario, we propose a framework that integrates media data collection, user profile creation, and cognitive architecture for opinion updates to successfully reproduce the real trend of US attitudes towards China over a 20-year period from 2005 to today. We also leverage LLMs' capabilities to introduce debiased media exposure, extracting neutral events from typically subjective news contents, to uncover the roots of polarized opinion formation, as well as a devils advocate agent to help explain the rare reversal from negative to positive attitudes towards China, corresponding with changes in the way Americans obtain information about the country. The simulation results, beyond validating our framework architecture, also reveal the impact of biased framing and selection bias in shaping attitudes. Overall, our work contributes to a new paradigm for LLM-based modeling of cognitive behaviors in a large-scale, long-term, cross-border social context, providing insights into the formation of international biases and offering valuable implications for media consumers to better understand the factors shaping their perspectives, and ultimately contributing to the larger social need for bias reduction and cross-cultural tolerance.

      In this paper, we introduce a systematic framework beyond conventional method to assess LLMs' mathematical-reasoning robustness by stress-testing them on advanced math problems that are mathematically equivalent but with linguistic and parametric variation. These transformations allow us to measure the sensitivity of LLMs to non-mathematical perturbations, thereby enabling a more accurate evaluation of their mathematical reasoning capabilities. Using this new evaluation methodology, we created PutnamGAP, a new benchmark dataset with multiple mathematically-equivalent variations of competition-level math problems. With the new dataset, we evaluate multiple families of representative LLMs and examine their robustness. Across 18 commercial and open-source models we observe sharp performance degradation on the variants. OpenAI's flagship reasoning model, O3, scores 49 % on the originals but drops by 4 percentage points on surface variants, and by 10.5 percentage points on core-step-based variants, while smaller models fare far worse. Overall, the results show that the proposed new evaluation methodology is effective for deepening our understanding of the robustness of LLMs and generating new insights for further improving their mathematical reasoning capabilities.

      Large language models (LLMs) hold promise in clinical decision support but face major challenges in safety evaluation and effectiveness validation. We developed the Clinical Safety-Effectiveness Dual-Track Benchmark (CSEDB), a multidimensional framework built on clinical expert consensus, encompassing 30 criteria covering critical areas like critical illness recognition, guideline adherence, and medication safety, with weighted consequence measures. Thirty-two specialist physicians developed and reviewed 2,069 open-ended Q\&A items aligned with these criteria, spanning 26 clinical departments to simulate real-world scenarios. Benchmark testing of six LLMs revealed moderate overall performance (average total score 57.2\%, safety 54.7\%, effectiveness 62.3\%), with a significant 13.3\% performance drop in high-risk scenarios (p $<$ 0.0001). Domain-specific medical LLMs showed consistent performance advantages over general-purpose models, with relatively higher top scores in safety (0.912) and effectiveness (0.861). The findings of this study not only provide a standardized metric for evaluating the clinical application of medical LLMs, facilitating comparative analyses, risk exposure identification, and improvement directions across different scenarios, but also hold the potential to promote safer and more effective deployment of large language models in healthcare environments.

      Large language models (LLMs) acquire vast knowledge from large text corpora, but this information can become outdated or inaccurate. Since retraining is computationally expensive, knowledge editing offers an efficient alternative -- modifying internal knowledge without full retraining. These methods aim to update facts precisely while preserving the model's overall capabilities. While existing surveys focus on the mechanism of editing (e.g., parameter changes vs. external memory), they often overlook the function of the knowledge being edited. This survey introduces a novel, complementary function-based taxonomy to provide a more holistic view. We examine how different mechanisms apply to various knowledge types -- factual, temporal, conceptual, commonsense, and social -- highlighting how editing effectiveness depends on the nature of the target knowledge. By organizing our review along these two axes, we map the current landscape, outline the strengths and limitations of existing methods, define the problem formally, survey evaluation tasks and datasets, and conclude with open challenges and future directions.

      Evaluating personalized recommendations remains a central challenge, especially in long-form audio domains like podcasts, where traditional offline metrics suffer from exposure bias and online methods such as A/B testing are costly and operationally constrained. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as offline judges to assess the quality of podcast recommendations in a scalable and interpretable manner. Our two-stage profile-aware approach first constructs natural-language user profiles distilled from 90 days of listening history. These profiles summarize both topical interests and behavioral patterns, serving as compact, interpretable representations of user preferences. Rather than prompting the LLM with raw data, we use these profiles to provide high-level, semantically rich context-enabling the LLM to reason more effectively about alignment between a user's interests and recommended episodes. This reduces input complexity and improves interpretability. The LLM is then prompted to deliver fine-grained pointwise and pairwise judgments based on the profile-episode match. In a controlled study with 47 participants, our profile-aware judge matched human judgments with high fidelity and outperformed or matched a variant using raw listening histories. The framework enables efficient, profile-aware evaluation for iterative testing and model selection in recommender systems.

DevNous integrates directly into team chat environments, identifying actionable intents from informal dialogue and managing stateful, multi-turn workflows for core administrative tasks like automated task formalization and progress summary synthesis. To quantitatively evaluate the system, we introduce a new benchmark of 160 realistic, interactive conversational turns. The dataset was manually annotated with a multi-label ground truth and is publicly available. On this benchmark, DevNous achieves an exact match turn accuracy of 81.3\% and a multiset F1-Score of 0.845, providing strong evidence for its viability.

      Post-training is essential for the success of large language models (LLMs), transforming pre-trained base models into more useful and aligned post-trained models. While plenty of works have studied post-training algorithms and evaluated post-training models by their outputs, it remains understudied how post-training reshapes LLMs internally. In this paper, we compare base and post-trained LLMs mechanistically from four perspectives to better understand post-training effects. Our findings across model families and datasets reveal that: (1) Post-training does not change the factual knowledge storage locations, and it adapts knowledge representations from the base model while developing new knowledge representations; (2) Both truthfulness and refusal can be represented by vectors in the hidden representation space. The truthfulness direction is highly similar between the base and post-trained model, and it is effectively transferable for interventions; (3) The refusal direction is different between the base and post-trained models, and it shows limited forward transferability; (4) Differences in confidence between the base and post-trained models cannot be attributed to entropy neurons. Our study provides insights into the fundamental mechanisms preserved and altered during post-training, facilitates downstream tasks like model steering, and could potentially benefit future research in interpretability and LLM post-training.

      Python has become the dominant language for general-purpose programming, yet it lacks robust tools for formal verification. In contrast, programmers working in languages such as C benefit from mature model checkers, for example CBMC, which enable exhaustive symbolic reasoning and fault localisation. The inherent complexity of Python, coupled with the verbosity and low-level nature of existing transpilers (e.g., Cython), have historically limited the applicability of formal verification to Python programs. In this paper, we propose PyVeritas, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for high-level transpilation from Python to C, followed by bounded model checking and MaxSAT-based fault localisation in the generated C code. PyVeritas enables verification and bug localisation for Python code using existing model checking tools for C. Our empirical evaluation on two Python benchmarks demonstrates that LLM-based transpilation can achieve a high degree of accuracy, up to 80--90% for some LLMs, enabling effective development environment that supports assertion-based verification and interpretable fault diagnosis for small yet non-trivial Python programs.

      Evaluating AI agents within complex, interactive environments that mirror real-world challenges is critical for understanding their practical capabilities. While existing agent benchmarks effectively assess skills like tool use or performance on structured tasks, they often do not fully capture an agent's ability to operate autonomously in exploratory environments that demand sustained, self-directed reasoning over a long and growing context. To spur the development of agents capable of more robust intrinsic reasoning over long horizons, we introduce TextQuests, a benchmark based on the Infocom suite of interactive fiction games. These text-based adventures, which can take human players over 30 hours and require hundreds of precise actions to solve, serve as an effective proxy for evaluating AI agents on focused, stateful tasks. The benchmark is specifically designed to assess an LLM agent's capacity for self-contained problem-solving by precluding the use of external tools, thereby focusing on intrinsic long-context reasoning capabilities in an exploratory environment characterized by the need for trial-and-error learning and sustained problem-solving within a single interactive session.

      This paper introduces a novel Large Language Models (LLMs)-assisted agent that automatically converts natural-language descriptions of power system optimization scenarios into compact, solver-ready formulations and generates corresponding solutions. In contrast to approaches that rely solely on LLM to produce solutions directly, the proposed method focuses on discovering a mathematically compatible formulation that can be efficiently solved by off-the-shelf optimization solvers. Directly using LLMs to produce solutions often leads to infeasible or suboptimal results, as these models lack the numerical precision and constraint-handling capabilities of established optimization solvers. The pipeline integrates a domain-aware prompt and schema with an LLM, enforces feasibility through systematic validation and iterative repair, and returns both solver-ready models and user-facing results. Using the unit commitment problem as a representative case study, the agent produces optimal or near-optimal schedules along with the associated objective costs. Results demonstrate that coupling the solver with task-specific validation significantly enhances solution reliability. This work shows that combining AI with established optimization frameworks bridges high-level problem descriptions and executable mathematical models, enabling more efficient decision-making in energy systems

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to generating fluent but incorrect content, known as confabulation, which poses increasing risks in multi-turn or agentic applications where outputs may be reused as context. In this work, we investigate how in-context information influences model behavior and whether LLMs can identify their unreliable responses. We propose a reliability estimation that leverages token-level uncertainty to guide the aggregation of internal model representations. Specifically, we compute aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty from output logits to identify salient tokens and aggregate their hidden states into compact representations for response-level reliability prediction. Through controlled experiments on open QA benchmarks, we find that correct in-context information improves both answer accuracy and model confidence, while misleading context often induces confidently incorrect responses, revealing a misalignment between uncertainty and correctness. Our probing-based method captures these shifts in model behavior and improves the detection of unreliable outputs across multiple open-source LLMs. These results underscore the limitations of direct uncertainty signals and highlight the potential of uncertainty-guided probing for reliability-aware generation.

      The security of LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) is critically threatened by propagation vulnerability, where malicious agents can distort collective decision-making through inter-agent message interactions. While existing supervised defense methods demonstrate promising performance, they may be impractical in real-world scenarios due to their heavy reliance on labeled malicious agents to train a supervised malicious detection model. To enable practical and generalizable MAS defenses, in this paper, we propose BlindGuard, an unsupervised defense method that learns without requiring any attack-specific labels or prior knowledge of malicious behaviors. To this end, we establish a hierarchical agent encoder to capture individual, neighborhood, and global interaction patterns of each agent, providing a comprehensive understanding for malicious agent detection. Meanwhile, we design a corruption-guided detector that consists of directional noise injection and contrastive learning, allowing effective detection model training solely on normal agent behaviors. Extensive experiments show that BlindGuard effectively detects diverse attack types (i.e., prompt injection, memory poisoning, and tool attack) across MAS with various communication patterns while maintaining superior generalizability compared to supervised baselines.

      Indoor navigation remains a complex challenge due to the absence of reliable GPS signals and the architectural intricacies of large enclosed environments. This study presents an indoor localization and navigation approach that integrates vision-based localization with large language model (LLM)-based navigation. The localization system utilizes a ResNet-50 convolutional neural network fine-tuned through a two-stage process to identify the user's position using smartphone camera input. To complement localization, the navigation module employs an LLM, guided by a carefully crafted system prompt, to interpret preprocessed floor plan images and generate step-by-step directions. Experimental evaluation was conducted in a realistic office corridor with repetitive features and limited visibility to test localization robustness. The model achieved high confidence and an accuracy of 96% across all tested waypoints, even under constrained viewing conditions and short-duration queries. Navigation tests using ChatGPT on real building floor maps yielded an average instruction accuracy of 75%, with observed limitations in zero-shot reasoning and inference time. This research demonstrates the potential for scalable, infrastructure-free indoor navigation using off-the-shelf cameras and publicly available floor plans, particularly in resource-constrained settings like hospitals, airports, and educational institutions.

We implement and evaluate these components as modular, configurable mechanisms within an adaptive collaboration architecture while assessing the effect of the number of agents involved based on the task's requirements and domain. Systematic evaluation of computational implementations of teamwork behaviors across eight medical benchmarks (MedQA, MedMCQA, MMLU-Pro Medical, PubMedQA, DDXPlus, MedBullets, Path-VQA, and PMC-VQA) demonstrates consistent improvements across 7 out of 8 evaluated datasets. Controlled ablation studies conducted on 50 questions per configuration across 3 independent runs provide mechanistic insights into individual component contributions, revealing optimal teamwork configurations that vary by reasoning task complexity and domain-specific requirements. Our ablation analyses reveal dataset-specific optimal teamwork configurations, indicating that different medical reasoning modalities benefit from distinct collaborative patterns.

      Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their increased accessibility have made it easier than ever for students to automatically generate texts, posing new challenges for educational institutions. To enforce norms of academic integrity and ensure students' learning, learning analytics methods to automatically detect LLM-generated text appear increasingly appealing. This paper benchmarks the performance of different state-of-the-art detectors in educational contexts, introducing a novel dataset, called Generative Essay Detection in Education (GEDE), containing over 900 student-written essays and over 12,500 LLM-generated essays from various domains. To capture the diversity of LLM usage practices in generating text, we propose the concept of contribution levels, representing students' contribution to a given assignment. These levels range from purely human-written texts, to slightly LLM-improved versions, to fully LLM-generated texts, and finally to active attacks on the detector by "humanizing" generated texts. We show that most detectors struggle to accurately classify texts of intermediate student contribution levels, like LLM-improved human-written texts. Detectors are particularly likely to produce false positives, which is problematic in educational settings where false suspicions can severely impact students' lives.

      The introduction of 5G and the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture has enabled more flexible and intelligent network deployments. However, the increased complexity and openness of these architectures also introduce novel security challenges, such as data manipulation attacks on the semi-standardised Shared Data Layer (SDL) within the O-RAN platform through malicious xApps. In particular, malicious xApps can exploit this vulnerability by introducing subtle Unicode-wise alterations (hypoglyphs) into the data that are being used by traditional machine learning (ML)-based anomaly detection methods. These Unicode-wise manipulations can potentially bypass detection and cause failures in anomaly detection systems based on traditional ML, such as AutoEncoders, which are unable to process hypoglyphed data without crashing. We investigate the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for anomaly detection within the O-RAN architecture to address this challenge. We demonstrate that LLM-based xApps maintain robust operational performance and are capable of processing manipulated messages without crashing. While initial detection accuracy requires further improvements, our results highlight the robustness of LLMs to adversarial attacks such as hypoglyphs in input data. There is potential to use their adaptability through prompt engineering to further improve the accuracy, although this requires further research. Additionally, we show that LLMs achieve low detection latency (under 0.07 seconds), making them suitable for Near-Real-Time (Near-RT) RIC deployments.

      "Fedspeak", the stylized and often nuanced language used by the U.S. Federal Reserve, encodes implicit policy signals and strategic stances. The Federal Open Market Committee strategically employs Fedspeak as a communication tool to shape market expectations and influence both domestic and global economic conditions. As such, automatically parsing and interpreting Fedspeak presents a high-impact challenge, with significant implications for financial forecasting, algorithmic trading, and data-driven policy analysis. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based, uncertainty-aware framework for deciphering Fedspeak and classifying its underlying monetary policy stance. Technically, to enrich the semantic and contextual representation of Fedspeak texts, we incorporate domain-specific reasoning grounded in the monetary policy transmission mechanism. We further introduce a dynamic uncertainty decoding module to assess the confidence of model predictions, thereby enhancing both classification accuracy and model reliability. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the policy stance analysis task. Moreover, statistical analysis reveals a significant positive correlation between perceptual uncertainty and model error rates, validating the effectiveness of perceptual uncertainty as a diagnostic signal.

      Personalizing language models by effectively incorporating user interaction history remains a central challenge in the development of adaptive AI systems. While large language models (LLMs) combined with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have improved factual accuracy, they often lack structured memory and fail to scale in complex, long-term interactions. To address this, we propose a flexible external memory framework based on knowledge graphs, automatically constructed and updated by the LLM itself, and capable of encoding information in multiple formats-including nodes, triplets, higher-order propositions, and episodic traces. Building upon the AriGraph architecture, we introduce a novel hybrid graph design that supports both standard edges and two types of hyperedges, enabling rich and dynamic semantic and temporal representations. Our framework also supports diverse retrieval mechanisms, including A*, water-circle propagation, beam search, and hybrid methods, making it adaptable to different datasets and LLM capacities. We evaluate our system on three benchmarks-TriviaQA, HotpotQA, and DiaASQ-demonstrating that different memory and retrieval configurations yield optimal performance depending on the task. Additionally, we extend the DiaASQ benchmark with temporal annotations and internally contradictory statements, showing that our system remains robust and effective in managing temporal dependencies and context-aware reasoning.

      Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a challenging task that aims to generate spoken language sentences from sign language videos. In this paper, we introduce a lightweight, modular SLT framework, Spotter+GPT, that leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and avoids heavy end-to-end training. Spotter+GPT breaks down the SLT task into two distinct stages. First, a sign spotter identifies individual signs within the input video. The spotted signs are then passed to an LLM, which transforms them into meaningful spoken language sentences. Spotter+GPT eliminates the requirement for SLT-specific training. This significantly reduces computational costs and time requirements. The source code and pretrained weights of the Spotter are available at https://gitlab.surrey.ac.uk/cogvispublic/sign-spotter.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Large Language Model (LLM) agentic systems are software systems powered by LLMs that autonomously reason, plan, and execute multi-step workflows to achieve human goals, rather than merely executing predefined steps. During execution, these workflows frequently encounter exceptions. Existing exception handling solutions often treat exceptions superficially, failing to trace execution-phase exceptions to their reasoning-phase root causes. Furthermore, their recovery logic is brittle, lacking structured escalation pathways when initial attempts fail. To tackle these challenges, we first present a comprehensive taxonomy of 36 exception types across 12 agent artifacts. Building on this, we propose SHIELDA (Structured Handling of Exceptions in LLM-Driven Agentic Workflows), a modular runtime exception handling framework for LLM agentic workflows. SHIELDA uses an exception classifier to select a predefined exception handling pattern from a handling pattern registry. These patterns are then executed via a structured handling executor, comprising local handling, flow control, and state recovery, to enable phase-aware recovery by linking exceptions to their root causes and facilitating composable strategies. We validate SHIELDA's effectiveness through a case study on the AutoPR agent, demonstrating effective, cross-phase recovery from a reasoning-induced exception.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Using LLMs in a production environment presents security challenges that include vulnerabilities to jailbreaks and prompt injections, which can result in harmful outputs for humans or the enterprise. The challenge is amplified when working within a specific domain, as topics generally accepted for LLMs to address may be irrelevant to that field. These problems can be mitigated, for example, by fine-tuning large language models with domain-specific and security-focused data. However, these alone are insufficient, as jailbreak techniques evolve. Additionally, API-accessed models do not offer the flexibility needed to tailor behavior to industry-specific objectives, and in-context learning is not always sufficient or reliable. In response to these challenges, we introduce Archias, an expert model adept at distinguishing between in-domain and out-of-domain communications. Archias classifies user inquiries into several categories: in-domain (specifically for the automotive industry), malicious questions, price injections, prompt injections, and out-of-domain examples. Our methodology integrates outputs from the expert model (Archias) into prompts, which are then processed by the LLM to generate responses. This method increases the model's ability to understand the user's intention and give appropriate answers. Archias can be adjusted, fine-tuned, and used for many different purposes due to its small size. Therefore, it can be easily customized to the needs of any industry. To validate our approach, we created a benchmark dataset for the automotive industry. Furthermore, in the interest of advancing research and development, we release our benchmark dataset to the community.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in software engineering research, offering new opportunities for automating repository mining tasks. However, despite their growing popularity, the methodological integration of LLMs into Mining Software Repositories (MSR) remains poorly understood. Existing studies tend to focus on specific capabilities or performance benchmarks, providing limited insight into how researchers utilize LLMs across the full research pipeline. To address this gap, we conduct a mixed-method study that combines a rapid review and questionnaire survey in the field of LLM4MSR. We investigate (1) the approaches and (2) the threats that affect the empirical rigor of researchers involved in this field. Our findings reveal 15 methodological approaches, nine main threats, and 25 mitigation strategies. Building on these findings, we present PRIMES 2.0, a refined empirical framework organized into six stages, comprising 23 methodological substeps, each mapped to specific threats and corresponding mitigation strategies, providing prescriptive and adaptive support throughout the lifecycle of LLM-based MSR studies. Our work contributes to establishing a more transparent and reproducible foundation for LLM-based MSR research.

      This paper introduces an advanced AI-driven perception system for autonomous quadcopter navigation in GPS-denied indoor environments. The proposed framework leverages cloud computing to offload computationally intensive tasks and incorporates a custom-designed printed circuit board (PCB) for efficient sensor data acquisition, enabling robust navigation in confined spaces. The system integrates YOLOv11 for object detection, Depth Anything V2 for monocular depth estimation, a PCB equipped with Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and a cloud-based Large Language Model (LLM) for context-aware decision-making. A virtual safety envelope, enforced by calibrated sensor offsets, ensures collision avoidance, while a multithreaded architecture achieves low-latency processing. Enhanced spatial awareness is facilitated by 3D bounding box estimation with Kalman filtering. Experimental results in an indoor testbed demonstrate strong performance, with object detection achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP50) of 0.6, depth estimation Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 7.2 cm, only 16 safety envelope breaches across 42 trials over approximately 11 minutes, and end-to-end system latency below 1 second. This cloud-supported, high-intelligence framework serves as an auxiliary perception and navigation system, complementing state-of-the-art drone autonomy for GPS-denied confined spaces.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used as automated judges, where practical value depends on both accuracy and trustworthy, risk-aware judgments. Existing approaches predominantly focus on accuracy, overlooking the necessity of well-calibrated confidence, which is vital for adaptive and reliable evaluation pipelines. In this work, we advocate a shift from accuracy-centric evaluation to confidence-driven, risk-aware LLM-as-a-Judge systems, emphasizing the necessity of well-calibrated confidence for trustworthy and adaptive evaluation. We systematically identify the Overconfidence Phenomenon in current LLM-as-a-Judges, where predicted confidence significantly overstates actual correctness, undermining reliability in practical deployment. To quantify this phenomenon, we introduce TH-Score, a novel metric measuring confidence-accuracy alignment. Furthermore, we propose LLM-as-a-Fuser, an ensemble framework that transforms LLMs into reliable, risk-aware evaluators. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially improves calibration and enables adaptive, confidence-driven evaluation pipelines, achieving superior reliability and accuracy compared to existing baselines.

Legal-BERT and Contracts-BERT establish new SOTAs on two of the three tasks, despite having 69% fewer parameters than the best-performing general-purpose LLM. We also identify CaseLaw-BERT and LexLM as strong additional baselines for contract understanding. Our results provide a holistic evaluation of legal-specific LLMs and will facilitate the development of more accurate contract understanding systems.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, but struggle with multi-hop reasoning and factual consistency, limiting their effectiveness on knowledge-intensive tasks like complex question answering (QA). Linking Knowledge Graphs (KG) and LLMs has shown promising results, but LLMs generally lack the ability to reason efficiently over graph-structured information. To address this challenge, we introduce DAGR, a retrieval method that leverages both complex questions and their decomposition in subquestions to extract relevant, linked textual subgraphs. DAGR first breaks down complex queries, retrieves subgraphs guided by a weighted similarity function over both the original and decomposed queries, and creates a question-specific knowledge graph to guide answer generation. The resulting Graph-RAG pipeline is suited to handle complex multi-hop questions and effectively reason over graph-structured data. We evaluate DAGR on standard multi-hop QA benchmarks and show that it achieves comparable or superior performance to competitive existing methods, using smaller models and fewer LLM calls.

      Despite the steady progress in machine translation evaluation, existing automatic metrics struggle to capture how well meaning is preserved beyond sentence boundaries. We posit that reliance on a single intrinsic quality score, trained to mimic human judgments, might be insufficient for evaluating translations of long, complex passages, and a more ``pragmatic'' approach that assesses how accurately key information is conveyed by a translation in context is needed. We introduce TREQA (Translation Evaluation via Question-Answering), a framework that extrinsically evaluates translation quality by assessing how accurately candidate translations answer reading comprehension questions that target key information in the original source or reference texts. In challenging domains that require long-range understanding, such as literary texts, we show that TREQA is competitive with and, in some cases, outperforms state-of-the-art neural and LLM-based metrics in ranking alternative paragraph-level translations, despite never being explicitly optimized to correlate with human judgments. Furthermore, the generated questions and answers offer interpretability: empirical analysis shows that they effectively target translation errors identified by experts in evaluated datasets.

      As large language models take on growing roles as automated evaluators in practical settings, a critical question arises: Can individuals persuade an LLM judge to assign unfairly high scores? This study is the first to reveal that strategically embedded persuasive language can bias LLM judges when scoring mathematical reasoning tasks, where correctness should be independent of stylistic variation. Grounded in Aristotle's rhetorical principles, we formalize seven persuasion techniques (Majority, Consistency, Flattery, Reciprocity, Pity, Authority, Identity) and embed them into otherwise identical responses. Across six math benchmarks, we find that persuasive language leads LLM judges to assign inflated scores to incorrect solutions, by up to 8% on average, with Consistency causing the most severe distortion. Notably, increasing model size does not substantially mitigate this vulnerability. Further analysis demonstrates that combining multiple persuasion techniques amplifies the bias, and pairwise evaluation is likewise susceptible. Moreover, the persuasive effect persists under counter prompting strategies, highlighting a critical vulnerability in LLM-as-a-Judge pipelines and underscoring the need for robust defenses against persuasion-based attacks.

      The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture is a cornerstone of modern state-of-the-art (SOTA) large language models (LLMs). MoE models facilitate scalability by enabling sparse parameter activation.

To overcome this limitation, we introduce Grove MoE, a novel architecture incorporating experts of varying sizes, inspired by the heterogeneous big.LITTLE CPU architecture. This architecture features novel adjugate experts with a dynamic activation mechanism, enabling model capacity expansion while maintaining manageable computational overhead. Building on this architecture, we present GroveMoE-Base and GroveMoE-Inst, 33B-parameter LLMs developed by applying an upcycling strategy to the Qwen3-30B-A3B-Base model during mid-training and post-training. GroveMoE models dynamically activate 3.14-3.28B parameters based on token complexity and achieve performance comparable to SOTA open-source models of similar or even larger size.

      The integration of LLMs into robots has witnessed significant growth, where LLMs can convert instructions into executable robot policies. However, the inherent vulnerability of LLMs to jailbreak attacks brings critical security risks from the digital domain to the physical world. An attacked LLM-based robot could execute harmful policies and cause physical harm. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility and rationale of jailbreak attacks against LLM-based robots and answer three research questions: (1) How applicable are existing LLM jailbreak attacks against LLM-based robots? (2) What unique challenges arise if they are not directly applicable? (3) How to defend against such jailbreak attacks? To this end, we first construct a "human-object-environment" robot risks-oriented Harmful-RLbench and then conduct a measurement study on LLM-based robot systems. Our findings conclude that traditional LLM jailbreak attacks are inapplicable in robot scenarios, and we identify two unique challenges: determining policy-executable optimization directions and accurately evaluating robot-jailbroken policies. To enable a more thorough security analysis, we introduce POEX (POlicy EXecutable) jailbreak, a red-teaming framework that induces harmful yet executable policy to jailbreak LLM-based robots. POEX incorporates hidden layer gradient optimization to guarantee jailbreak success and policy execution as well as a multi-agent evaluator to accurately assess the practical executability of policies. Experiments conducted on the real-world robotic systems and in simulation demonstrate the efficacy of POEX, highlighting critical security vulnerabilities and its transferability across LLMs. Finally, we propose prompt-based and model-based defenses to mitigate attacks. Our findings underscore the urgent need for security measures to ensure the safe deployment of LLM-based robots in critical applications.

      Insider threats, which can lead to severe losses, remain a major security concern. While machine learning-based insider threat detection (ITD) methods have shown promising results, their progress is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality data. Enterprise data is sensitive and rarely accessible, while publicly available datasets, when limited in scale due to cost, lack sufficient real-world coverage; and when purely synthetic, they fail to capture rich semantics and realistic user behavior. To address this, we propose Chimera, the first large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent framework that automatically simulates both benign and malicious insider activities and collects diverse logs across diverse enterprise environments. Chimera models each employee with agents that have role-specific behavior and integrates modules for group meetings, pairwise interactions, and autonomous scheduling, capturing realistic organizational dynamics. It incorporates 15 types of insider attacks (e.g., IP theft, system sabotage) and has been deployed to simulate activities in three sensitive domains: technology company, finance corporation, and medical institution, producing a new dataset, ChimeraLog. We assess ChimeraLog via human studies and quantitative analysis, confirming its diversity, realism, and presence of explainable threat patterns. Evaluations of existing ITD methods show an average F1-score of 0.83, which is significantly lower than 0.99 on the CERT dataset, demonstrating ChimeraLog's higher difficulty and utility for advancing ITD research.

      Unit testing plays a pivotal role in the software development lifecycle, as it ensures code quality. However, writing high-quality unit tests remains a time-consuming task for developers in practice. More recently, the application of large language models (LLMs) in automated unit test generation has demonstrated promising results. Existing approaches primarily focus on interpreted programming languages (e.g., Java), while mature solutions tailored to compiled programming languages like C++ are yet to be explored. The intricate language features of C++, such as pointers, templates, and virtual functions, pose particular challenges for LLMs in generating both executable and high-coverage unit tests. To tackle the aforementioned problems, this paper introduces CITYWALK, a novel LLM-based framework for C++ unit test generation. CITYWALK enhances LLMs by providing a comprehensive understanding of the dependency relationships within the project under test via program analysis. Furthermore, CITYWALK incorporates language-specific knowledge about C++ derived from project documentation and empirical observations, significantly improving the correctness of the LLM-generated unit tests. We implement CITYWALK by employing the widely popular LLM GPT-4o.

It contains diverse instructions for website generation, created through the combined efforts of human annotators and GPT-4o. These instructions span three major categories and thirteen minor categories, encompassing nearly all important types of web applications. To assess the quality of the generated websites, we use GPT-4o to generate test cases targeting each functionality described in the instructions, and then manually filter, adjust, and organize them to ensure accuracy, resulting in 647 test cases. Each test case specifies an operation to be performed on the website and the expected result after the operation. To automate testing and improve reproducibility, we employ a powerful web-navigation agent to execute tests on the generated websites and determine whether the observed responses align with the expected results. We evaluate three high-performance code-agent frameworks, Bolt.diy, OpenHands, and Aider, using multiple proprietary and open-source LLMs as engines. The best-performing combination, Bolt.diy powered by DeepSeek-R1, achieves only 27.8\% accuracy on the test cases, highlighting the challenging nature of our benchmark.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing how users interact with information systems, yet their high inference cost poses serious scalability and sustainability challenges. Caching inference responses, allowing them to be retrieved without another forward pass through the LLM, has emerged as one possible solution. Traditional exact-match caching, however, overlooks the semantic similarity between queries, leading to unnecessary recomputation. Semantic caching addresses this by retrieving responses based on semantic similarity, but introduces a fundamentally different cache eviction problem: one must account for mismatch costs between incoming queries and cached responses. Moreover, key system parameters, such as query arrival probabilities and serving costs, are often unknown and must be learned over time. Existing semantic caching methods are largely ad-hoc, lacking theoretical foundations and unable to adapt to real-world uncertainty. In this paper, we present a principled, learning-based framework for semantic cache eviction under unknown query and cost distributions. We formulate both offline optimization and online learning variants of the problem, and develop provably efficient algorithms with state-of-the-art guarantees. We also evaluate our framework on a synthetic dataset, showing that our proposed algorithms perform matching or superior performance compared with baselines.

      Addressing contextual privacy concerns remains challenging in interactive settings where large language models (LLMs) process information from multiple sources (e.g., summarizing meetings with private and public information). We introduce a multi-agent framework that decomposes privacy reasoning into specialized subtasks (extraction, classification), reducing the information load on any single agent while enabling iterative validation and more reliable adherence to contextual privacy norms. To understand how privacy errors emerge and propagate, we conduct a systematic ablation over information-flow topologies, revealing when and why upstream detection mistakes cascade into downstream leakage. Experiments on the ConfAIde and PrivacyLens benchmark with several open-source and closed-sourced LLMs demonstrate that our best multi-agent configuration substantially reduces private information leakage (\textbf{18\%} on ConfAIde and \textbf{19\%} on PrivacyLens with GPT-4o) while preserving the fidelity of public content, outperforming single-agent baselines. These results highlight the promise of principled information-flow design in multi-agent systems for contextual privacy with LLMs.

      Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with diverse human values requires moving beyond a single holistic "better-than" preference criterion. While collecting fine-grained, aspect-specific preference data is more reliable and scalable, existing methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) struggle with the severe noise and conflicts inherent in such aggregated datasets. In this paper, we tackle this challenge from a data-centric perspective. We first derive the Direct Multi-Preference Optimization (DMPO) objective, and uncover a key Preference Divergence (PD) term that quantifies inter-aspect preference conflicts. Instead of using this term for direct optimization, we leverage it to formulate a novel, theoretically-grounded data selection principle. Our principle advocates for selecting a subset of high-consensus data-identified by the most negative PD values-for efficient DPO training. We prove the optimality of this strategy by analyzing the loss bounds of the DMPO objective in the selection problem. To operationalize our approach, we introduce practical methods of PD term estimation and length bias mitigation, thereby proposing our PD selection method. Evaluation on the UltraFeedback dataset with three varying conflict levels shows that our simple yet effective strategy achieves over 10% relative improvement against both the standard holistic preference and a stronger oracle using aggregated preference signals, all while boosting training efficiency and obviating the need for intractable holistic preference annotating, unlocking the potential of robust LLM alignment via fine-grained preference signals.

      Text-to-SQL bridges the gap between natural language and structured database language, thus allowing non-technical users to easily query databases. Traditional approaches model text-to-SQL as a direct translation task, where a given Natural Language Query (NLQ) is mapped to an SQL command. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved translation accuracy, however, these methods all require that the target database is pre-specified. This becomes problematic in scenarios with multiple extensive databases, where identifying the correct database becomes a crucial yet overlooked step. In this paper, we propose a three-stage end-to-end text-to-SQL framework to identify the user's intended database before generating SQL queries. Our approach leverages LLMs and prompt engineering to extract implicit information from natural language queries (NLQs) in the form of a ruleset. We then train a large db\_id prediction model, which includes a RoBERTa-based finetuned encoder, to predict the correct Database identifier (db\_id) based on both the NLQ and the LLM-generated rules. Finally, we refine the generated SQL by using critic agents to correct errors. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms the current state-of-the-art models in both database intent prediction and SQL generation accuracy.
