      Counterfactual examples are widely employed to enhance the performance and robustness of large language models (LLMs) through counterfactual data augmentation (CDA). However, the selection of the judge model used to evaluate label flipping, the primary metric for assessing the validity of generated counterfactuals for CDA, yields inconsistent results. To decipher this, we define four types of relationships between the counterfactual generator and judge models: being the same model, belonging to the same model family, being independent models, and having an distillation relationship. Through extensive experiments involving two state-of-the-art LLM-based methods, three datasets, four generator models, and 15 judge models, complemented by a user study (n = 90), we demonstrate that judge models with an independent, non-fine-tuned relationship to the generator model provide the most reliable label flipping evaluations. Relationships between the generator and judge models, which are closely aligned with the user study for CDA, result in better model performance and robustness. Nevertheless, we find that the gap between the most effective judge models and the results obtained from the user study remains considerably large. This suggests that a fully automated pipeline for CDA may be inadequate and requires human intervention.

      Differentially private text sanitization refers to the process of privatizing texts under the framework of Differential Privacy (DP), providing provable privacy guarantees while also empirically defending against adversaries seeking to harm privacy. Despite their simplicity, DP text sanitization methods operating at the word level exhibit a number of shortcomings, among them the tendency to leave contextual clues from the original texts due to randomization during sanitization $\unicode{x2013}$ this we refer to as $\textit{contextual vulnerability}$. Given the powerful contextual understanding and inference capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we explore to what extent LLMs can be leveraged to exploit the contextual vulnerability of DP-sanitized texts. We expand on previous work not only in the use of advanced LLMs, but also in testing a broader range of sanitization mechanisms at various privacy levels. Our experiments uncover a double-edged sword effect of LLM-based data reconstruction attacks on privacy and utility: while LLMs can indeed infer original semantics and sometimes degrade empirical privacy protections, they can also be used for good, to improve the quality and privacy of DP-sanitized texts. Based on our findings, we propose recommendations for using LLM data reconstruction as a post-processing step, serving to increase privacy protection by thinking adversarially.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Ensuring the robustness of factual knowledge in LLMs is critical for reliable applications in tasks such as question answering and reasoning. However, existing evaluation methods predominantly focus on performance-based metrics, often investigating from the perspective of prompt perturbations, which captures only the externally triggered side of knowledge robustness. To bridge this gap, we introduce a principled approach to measure factual robustness from the perspective of the generation process by analyzing token distribution entropy in combination with temperature scaling sensitivity. These two factors build the Factual Robustness Score (FRS), a novel metric which quantifies the stability of a fact against perturbations in decoding conditions, given its initial uncertainty. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on 5 LLMs across 3 closed-book QA datasets (SQuAD, TriviaQA, and HotpotQA). We show that factual robustness varies significantly -- smaller models report an FRS of $0.76$, larger ones $0.93$ -- with accuracy degrading by ~$60\%$ under increased uncertainty. These insights demonstrate how entropy and temperature scaling impact factual accuracy, and lay a foundation for developing more robust knowledge retention and retrieval in future models.

      The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into Security Operations Centres (SOCs) presents a transformative, yet still evolving, opportunity to reduce analyst workload through human-AI collaboration. However, their real-world application in SOCs remains underexplored. To address this gap, we present a longitudinal study of 3,090 analyst queries from 45 SOC analysts over 10 months. Our analysis reveals that analysts use LLMs as on-demand aids for sensemaking and context-building, rather than for making high-stakes determinations, preserving analyst decision authority. The majority of queries are related to interpreting low-level telemetry (e.g., commands) and refining technical communication through short (1-3 turn) interactions. Notably, 93% of queries align with established cybersecurity competencies (NICE Framework), underscoring the relevance of LLM use for SOC-related tasks. Despite variations in tasks and engagement, usage trends indicate a shift from occasional exploration to routine integration, with growing adoption and sustained use among a subset of analysts. We find that LLMs function as flexible, on-demand cognitive aids that augment, rather than replace, SOC expertise. Our study provides actionable guidance for designing context-aware, human-centred AI assistance in security operations, highlighting the need for further in-the-wild research on real-world analyst-LLM collaboration, challenges, and impacts.

      Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have underscored the potential of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to facilitate the emergence of reasoning capabilities. Despite the encouraging results, a fundamental dilemma persists as RL improvement relies on learning from high-quality samples, yet the exploration for such samples remains bounded by the inherent limitations of LLMs. This, in effect, creates an undesirable cycle in which what cannot be explored cannot be learned. In this work, we propose Rubric-Scaffolded Reinforcement Learning (RuscaRL), a novel instructional scaffolding framework designed to break the exploration bottleneck for general LLM reasoning. Specifically, RuscaRL introduces checklist-style rubrics as (1) explicit scaffolding for exploration during rollout generation, where different rubrics are provided as external guidance within task instructions to steer diverse high-quality responses. This guidance is gradually decayed over time, encouraging the model to internalize the underlying reasoning patterns; (2) verifiable rewards for exploitation during model training, where we can obtain robust LLM-as-a-Judge scores using rubrics as references, enabling effective RL on general reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed RuscaRL across various benchmarks, effectively expanding reasoning boundaries under the best-of-N evaluation. Notably, RuscaRL significantly boosts Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct from 23.6 to 50.3 on HealthBench-500, surpassing GPT-4.1. Furthermore, our fine-tuned variant on Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct achieves 61.1 on HealthBench-500, outperforming leading LLMs including OpenAI-o3. This work is still in progress, and we will release the code, the models, and the datasets soon.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) has shifted artificial intelligence (AI) research toward agentic systems, motivating the use of weaker and more flexible notions of agency. However, this shift raises key questions about the extent to which LLM-based agents replicate human strategic reasoning, particularly in game-theoretic settings. In this context, we examine the role of agentic sophistication in shaping artificial reasoners' performance by evaluating three agent designs: a simple game-theoretic model, an unstructured LLM-as-agent model, and an LLM integrated into a traditional agentic framework. Using guessing games as a testbed, we benchmarked these agents against human participants across general reasoning patterns and individual role-based objectives. Furthermore, we introduced obfuscated game scenarios to assess agents' ability to generalise beyond training distributions. Our analysis, covering over 2000 reasoning samples across 25 agent configurations, shows that human-inspired cognitive structures can enhance LLM agents' alignment with human strategic behaviour. Still, the relationship between agentic design complexity and human-likeness is non-linear, highlighting a critical dependence on underlying LLM capabilities and suggesting limits to simple architectural augmentation.

      Computing education research (CER) is often instigated by practitioners wanting to improve both their own and the wider discipline's teaching practice. However, the latter is often difficult as many researchers lack the colleagues, resources, or capacity to conduct research that is generalisable or rigorous enough to advance the discipline. As a result, research methods that enable sense-making with larger volumes of qualitative data, while not increasing the burden on the researcher, have significant potential within CER. In this discussion paper, we propose such a method for conducting rigorous analysis on large volumes of textual data, namely a variation of LLM-assisted content analysis (LACA). This method combines content analysis with the use of large language models, empowering researchers to conduct larger-scale research which they would otherwise not be able to perform. Using a computing education dataset, we illustrate how LACA could be applied in a reproducible and rigorous manner. We believe this method has potential in CER, enabling more generalisable findings from a wider range of research. This, together with the development of similar methods, can help to advance both the practice and research quality of the CER discipline.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Large language model (LLM) decoding suffers from high latency due to fragmented execution across operators and heavy reliance on off-chip memory for data exchange and reduction. This execution model limits opportunities for fusion and incurs significant memory traffic and kernel launch overhead. While modern architectures such as NVIDIA Hopper provide distributed shared memory and low-latency intra-cluster interconnects, they expose only low-level data movement instructions, lacking structured abstractions for collective on-chip communication. To bridge this software-hardware gap, we introduce two cluster-level communication primitives, ClusterReduce and ClusterGather, which abstract common communication patterns and enable structured, high-speed data exchange and reduction between thread blocks within a cluster, allowing intermediate results to be on-chip without involving off-chip memory. Building on these abstractions, we design ClusterFusion, an execution framework that schedules communication and computation jointly to expand operator fusion scope by composing decoding stages such as QKV Projection, Attention, and Output Projection into a single fused kernels. Evaluations on H100 GPUs show that ClusterFusion outperforms state-of-the-art inference frameworks by 1.61x on average in end-to-end latency across different models and configurations.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      The proliferation of misinformation in the digital age has led to significant societal challenges. Existing approaches often struggle with capturing long-range dependencies, complex semantic relations, and the social dynamics influencing news dissemination. Furthermore, these methods require extensive labelled datasets, making their deployment resource-intensive. In this study, we propose a novel self-supervised misinformation detection framework that integrates both complex semantic relations using Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) and news propagation dynamics. We introduce an LLM-based graph contrastive loss (LGCL) that utilizes negative anchor points generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) to enhance feature separability in a zero-shot manner. To incorporate social context, we employ a multi view graph masked autoencoder, which learns news propagation features from social context graph. By combining these semantic and propagation-based features, our approach effectively differentiates between fake and real news in a self-supervised manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our self-supervised framework achieves superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art methodologies, even with limited labelled datasets while improving generalizability.

      Semi-structured tables, widely used in real-world applications (e.g., financial reports, medical records, transactional orders), often involve flexible and complex layouts (e.g., hierarchical headers and merged cells). These tables generally rely on human analysts to interpret table layouts and answer relevant natural language questions, which is costly and inefficient. To automate the procedure, existing methods face significant challenges. First, methods like NL2SQL require converting semi-structured tables into structured ones, which often causes substantial information loss. Second, methods like NL2Code and multi-modal LLM QA struggle to understand the complex layouts of semi-structured tables and cannot accurately answer corresponding questions. To this end, we propose ST-Raptor, a tree-based framework for semi-structured table question answering using large language models. First, we introduce the Hierarchical Orthogonal Tree (HO-Tree), a structural model that captures complex semi-structured table layouts, along with an effective algorithm for constructing the tree. Second, we define a set of basic tree operations to guide LLMs in executing common QA tasks. Given a user question, ST-Raptor decomposes it into simpler sub-questions, generates corresponding tree operation pipelines, and conducts operation-table alignment for accurate pipeline execution. Third, we incorporate a two-stage verification mechanism: forward validation checks the correctness of execution steps, while backward validation evaluates answer reliability by reconstructing queries from predicted answers. To benchmark the performance, we present SSTQA, a dataset of 764 questions over 102 real-world semi-structured tables. Experiments show that ST-Raptor outperforms nine baselines by up to 20% in answer accuracy. The code is available at https://github.com/weAIDB/ST-Raptor.

      Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) at scale requires meeting strict Service Level Objectives (SLOs) under severe computational and memory constraints. Nevertheless, traditional caching strategies fall short: exact-matching and prefix caches neglect query semantics, while state-of-the-art semantic caches remain confined to traditional intuitions, offering little conceptual departure. Building on this, we present SISO, a semantic caching system that redefines efficiency for LLM serving. SISO introduces centroid-based caching to maximize coverage with minimal memory, locality-aware replacement to preserve high-value entries, and dynamic thresholding to balance accuracy and latency under varying workloads. Across diverse datasets, SISO delivers up to 1.71$\times$ higher hit ratios and consistently stronger SLO attainment compared to state-of-the-art systems.

      Dynamic data dependency, answering "why a variable has this value?", is critical for debugging. Given a program step `s` reading a variable `v`, finding the dynamic definition of `v` is challenging. Traditional methods require either (1) exhaustive instrumentation of all possible definitions of `v` in one run or (2) replicating the run to re-examine reads/writes - both costly. If `v` is defined in a library, instrumentation becomes expensive; for non-deterministic programs, replication is infeasible. We propose RecovSlicing, which computes dynamic data dependency in a single run with partial instrumentation. We leverage LLMs to infer program behavior from a partially recorded trace and code context. Given a trace and a slicing criterion (step `s` and variable `v`), RecovSlicing estimates the runtime definition of `v` by recovering the missing execution.It also supports implicit variables, such as those in `list.get(i)`. Technically, RecovSlicing tackles: (1) recovering runtime values and structures, and (2) aligning recovered variables with recorded memory to analyze definitions. We evaluate RecovSlicing on 8,300 data dependencies across three slicing benchmarks, comparing it with Slicer4J, ND-Slicer, LLM Slicer, and re-execution Slicer. RecovSlicing achieves accuracy of 80.3%, 91.1%, and 98.3%, outperforming the best baseline (39.0%, 82.0%, 59.9%), and also leads in recall (91.1%, 91.1%, 98.3% vs. 53.4%, 79.1%, 87.1%). Integrated into a regression bug localizer, it enables finding 16% more regressions.

      Multilingual riddle generation challenges large language models (LLMs) to balance cultural fluency with creative abstraction. Standard prompting strategies -- zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought -- tend to reuse memorized riddles or perform shallow paraphrasing. We introduce Adaptive Originality Filtering (AOF), a prompting framework that filters redundant generations using cosine-based similarity rejection, while enforcing lexical novelty and cross-lingual fidelity. Evaluated across three LLMs and four language pairs, AOF-enhanced GPT-4o achieves \texttt{0.177} Self-BLEU and \texttt{0.915} Distinct-2 in Japanese, signaling improved lexical diversity and reduced redundancy compared to other prompting methods and language pairs.

      Incorporating ethics into the requirement elicitation process is essential for creating ethically aligned systems. Although eliciting manual ethics requirements is effective, it requires diverse input from multiple stakeholders, which can be challenging due to time and resource constraints. Moreover, it is often given a low priority in the requirements elicitation process. This study proposes a framework for generating ethics requirements drafts by introducing an ethics advocate agent in a multi-agent LLM setting. This agent critiques and provides input on ethical issues based on the system description. The proposed framework is evaluated through two case studies from different contexts, demonstrating that it captures the majority of ethics requirements identified by researchers during 30-minute interviews and introduces several additional relevant requirements. However, it also highlights reliability issues in generating ethics requirements, emphasizing the need for human feedback in this sensitive domain. We believe this work can facilitate the broader adoption of ethics in the requirements engineering process, ultimately leading to more ethically aligned products.

      Signature-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) detect malicious activities by matching network or host activity against predefined rules. These rules are derived from extensive Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), which includes attack signatures and behavioral patterns obtained through automated tools and manual threat analysis, such as sandboxing. The CTI is then transformed into actionable rules for the IDS engine, enabling real-time detection and prevention. However, the constant evolution of cyber threats necessitates frequent rule updates, which delay deployment time and weaken overall security readiness. Recent advancements in agentic systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the potential for autonomous IDS rule generation with internal evaluation. We introduce FALCON, an autonomous agentic framework that generates deployable IDS rules from CTI data in real-time and evaluates them using built-in multi-phased validators. To demonstrate versatility, we target both network (Snort) and host-based (YARA) mediums and construct a comprehensive dataset of IDS rules with their corresponding CTIs. Our evaluations indicate FALCON excels in automatic rule generation, with an average of 95% accuracy validated by qualitative evaluation with 84% inter-rater agreement among multiple cybersecurity analysts across all metrics. These results underscore the feasibility and effectiveness of LLM-driven data mining for real-time cyber threat mitigation.

      WebShell attacks, where malicious scripts are injected into web servers, pose a significant cybersecurity threat. Traditional ML and DL methods are often hampered by challenges such as the need for extensive training data, catastrophic forgetting, and poor generalization. Recently, Large Language Models have emerged as powerful alternatives for code-related tasks, but their potential in WebShell detection remains underexplored. In this paper, we make two contributions: (1) a comprehensive evaluation of seven LLMs, including GPT-4, LLaMA 3.1 70B, and Qwen 2.5 variants, benchmarked against traditional sequence- and graph-based methods using a dataset of 26.59K PHP scripts, and (2) the Behavioral Function-Aware Detection (BFAD) framework, designed to address the specific challenges of applying LLMs to this domain. Our framework integrates three components: a Critical Function Filter that isolates malicious PHP function calls, a Context-Aware Code Extraction strategy that captures the most behaviorally indicative code segments, and Weighted Behavioral Function Profiling that enhances in-context learning by prioritizing the most relevant demonstrations based on discriminative function-level profiles. Our results show that, stemming from their distinct analytical strategies, larger LLMs achieve near-perfect precision but lower recall, while smaller models exhibit the opposite trade-off. However, all baseline models lag behind previous SOTA methods. With the application of BFAD, the performance of all LLMs improves significantly, yielding an average F1 score increase of 13.82%. Notably, larger models now outperform SOTA benchmarks, while smaller models such as Qwen-2.5-Coder-3B achieve performance competitive with traditional methods. This work is the first to explore the feasibility and limitations of LLMs for WebShell detection and provides solutions to address the challenges in this task.

      Automated tabular understanding and reasoning are essential tasks for data scientists. Recently, Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly prevalent in tabular reasoning tasks. Previous work focuses on (1) finetuning LLMs using labeled data or (2) Training-free prompting LLM agents using chain-of-thought (CoT). Finetuning offers dataset-specific learning at the cost of generalizability. Training-free prompting is highly generalizable but does not take full advantage of training data. In this paper, we propose a novel prompting-based reasoning approach, Learn then Retrieve: LRTab, which integrates the benefits of both by retrieving relevant information learned from training data. We first use prompting to obtain CoT responses over the training data. For incorrect CoTs, we prompt the LLM to predict Prompt Conditions to avoid the error, learning insights from the data. We validate the effectiveness of Prompt Conditions using validation data. Finally, at inference time, we retrieve the most relevant Prompt Conditions for additional context for table understanding. We provide comprehensive experiments on WikiTQ and Tabfact, showing that LRTab is interpretable, cost-efficient, and can outperform previous baselines in tabular reasoning.

      Large language models (LLMs) based Recommender Systems (RecSys) can flexibly adapt recommendation systems to different domains. It utilizes in-context learning (ICL), i.e., the prompts, to customize the recommendation functions, which include sensitive historical user-specific item interactions, e.g., implicit feedback like clicked items or explicit product reviews. Such private information may be exposed to novel privacy attack. However, no study has been done on this important issue. We design four membership inference attacks (MIAs), aiming to reveal whether victims' historical interactions have been used by system prompts. They are \emph{direct inquiry, hallucination, similarity, and poisoning attacks}, each of which utilizes the unique features of LLMs or RecSys. We have carefully evaluated them on three LLMs that have been used to develop ICL-LLM RecSys and two well-known RecSys benchmark datasets. The results confirm that the MIA threat on LLM RecSys is realistic: direct inquiry and poisoning attacks showing significantly high attack advantages. We have also analyzed the factors affecting these attacks, such as the number of shots in system prompts and the position of the victim in the shots.

      Pairwise evaluation of large language models (LLMs) has become the dominant paradigm for benchmarking open-ended tasks, yet non-transitive preferences, where evaluators prefer A over B, B over C, but C over A, fundamentally undermine ranking reliability. We show that this critical issue stems largely from low-quality data that contains inherently ambiguous preference pairs. To address this challenge, we propose ELSPR, a principled graph-theoretic framework that models pairwise preferences as tournament graphs and systematically identifies problematic training data. ELSPR quantifies non-transitivity through strongly connected components (SCCs) analysis and measures overall preference clarity using a novel normalized directed graph structural entropy metric. Our filtering methodology selectively removes preference data that induce non-transitivity while preserving transitive preferences. Extensive experiments on the AlpacaEval benchmark demonstrate that models fine-tuned on ELSPR-filtered data achieve substantial improvements: a 13.8% reduction in non-transitivity, a 0.088 decrease in structural entropy, and significantly enhanced discriminative power in real-world evaluation systems. Human validation confirms that discarded data exhibit dramatically lower inter-annotator agreement (34.4% vs. 52.6%) and model-human consistency (51.2% vs. 80.6%) compared to cleaned data. These findings establish ELSPR as an effective data self-purification approach for developing more robust, consistent, and human-aligned LLM evaluation systems.

      For Large Language Models (LLMs), a disconnect persists between benchmark performance and real-world utility. Current evaluation frameworks remain fragmented, prioritizing technical metrics while neglecting holistic assessment for deployment. This survey introduces an anthropomorphic evaluation paradigm through the lens of human intelligence, proposing a novel three-dimensional taxonomy: Intelligence Quotient (IQ)-General Intelligence for foundational capacity, Emotional Quotient (EQ)-Alignment Ability for value-based interactions, and Professional Quotient (PQ)-Professional Expertise for specialized proficiency. For practical value, we pioneer a Value-oriented Evaluation (VQ) framework assessing economic viability, social impact, ethical alignment, and environmental sustainability. Our modular architecture integrates six components with an implementation roadmap. Through analysis of 200+ benchmarks, we identify key challenges including dynamic assessment needs and interpretability gaps. It provides actionable guidance for developing LLMs that are technically proficient, contextually relevant, and ethically sound.

      Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed through open-source and commercial frameworks, enabling individuals and organizations to self-host advanced LLM capabilities. As LLM deployments become prevalent, particularly in industry, ensuring their secure and reliable operation has become a critical issue. However, insecure defaults and misconfigurations often expose LLM services to the public internet, posing serious security and system engineering risks. This study conducted a large-scale empirical investigation of public-facing LLM deployments, focusing on the prevalence of services, exposure characteristics, systemic vulnerabilities, and associated risks. Through internet-wide measurements, we identified 320,102 public-facing LLM services across 15 frameworks and extracted 158 unique API endpoints, categorized into 12 functional groups based on functionality and security risk. Our analysis found that over 40% of endpoints used plain HTTP, and over 210,000 endpoints lacked valid TLS metadata. API exposure was highly inconsistent: some frameworks, such as Ollama, responded to over 35% of unauthenticated API requests, with about 15% leaking model or system information, while other frameworks implemented stricter controls. We observed widespread use of insecure protocols, poor TLS configurations, and unauthenticated access to critical operations. These security risks, such as model leakage, system compromise, and unauthorized access, are pervasive and highlight the need for a secure-by-default framework and stronger deployment practices.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      LLM app stores are quickly emerging as platforms that gather a wide range of intelligent applications based on LLMs, giving users many choices for content creation, coding support, education, and more. However, the current methods for ranking and recommending apps in these stores mostly rely on static metrics like user activity and favorites, which makes it hard for users to efficiently find high-quality apps. To address these challenges, we propose LaQual, an automated framework for evaluating the quality of LLM apps. LaQual consists of three main stages: first, it labels and classifies LLM apps in a hierarchical way to accurately match them to different scenarios; second, it uses static indicators, such as time-weighted user engagement and functional capability metrics, to filter out low-quality apps; and third, it conducts a dynamic, scenario-adaptive evaluation, where the LLM itself generates scenario-specific evaluation metrics, scoring rules, and tasks for a thorough quality assessment. Experiments on a popular LLM app store show that LaQual is effective. Its automated scores are highly consistent with human judgments (with Spearman's rho of 0.62 and p=0.006 in legal consulting, and rho of 0.60 and p=0.009 in travel planning). By effectively screening, LaQual can reduce the pool of candidate LLM apps by 66.7% to 81.3%. User studies further confirm that LaQual significantly outperforms baseline systems in decision confidence, comparison efficiency (with average scores of 5.45 compared to 3.30), and the perceived value of its evaluation reports (4.75 versus 2.25). Overall, these results demonstrate that LaQual offers a scalable, objective, and user-centered solution for finding and recommending high-quality LLM apps in real-world use cases.

      Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading is becoming central to modern distribution systems as rooftop PV and home energy management systems become pervasive, yet most existing market and reinforcement learning designs emphasize efficiency or private profit and offer little real-time guidance to ensure equitable outcomes under uncertainty. To address this gap, a fairness-aware multiagent reinforcement learning framework, FairMarket-RL, is proposed in which a large language model (LLM) critic shapes bidding policies within a continuous double auction under partial observability and discrete price-quantity actions. After each trading slot, the LLM returns normalized fairness scores Fairness-to-Grid (FTG), Fairness-Between-Sellers (FBS), and Fairness-of-Pricing (FPP) that are integrated into the reward via ramped coefficients and tunable scaling, so that fairness guidance complements, rather than overwhelms, economic incentives. The environment models realistic residential load and PV profiles and enforce hard constraints on prices, physical feasibility, and policy-update stability. Across a progression of experiments from a small pilot to a larger simulated community and a mixed-asset real-world dataset, the framework shifts exchanges toward local P2P trades, lowers consumer costs relative to grid-only procurement, sustains strong fairness across participants, and preserves utility viability. Sensitivity analyses over solar availability and aggregate demand further indicate robust performance, suggesting a scalable, LLM-guided pathway to decentralized electricity markets that are economically efficient, socially equitable, and technically sound.

Applying this method to the ultimatum game--a standard but difficult benchmark for LLMs--we observe improved alignment between simulated and empirical behavior, particularly on the responder side.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a pivotal methodology for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Unlike traditional pre-training approaches, RL encompasses multiple stages: rollout, reward, and training, which necessitates collaboration among various worker types. However, current RL systems continue to grapple with substantial GPU underutilization, due to two primary factors: (1) The rollout stage dominates the overall RL process due to test-time scaling; (2) Imbalances in rollout lengths (within the same batch) result in GPU bubbles. While prior solutions like asynchronous execution and truncation offer partial relief, they may compromise training accuracy for efficiency. Our key insight stems from a previously overlooked observation: rollout responses exhibit remarkable similarity across adjacent training epochs. Based on the insight, we introduce RhymeRL, an LLM RL system designed to accelerate RL training with two key innovations. First, to enhance rollout generation, we present HistoSpec, a speculative decoding inference engine that utilizes the similarity of historical rollout token sequences to obtain accurate drafts. Second, to tackle rollout bubbles, we introduce HistoPipe, a two-tier scheduling strategy that leverages the similarity of historical rollout distributions to balance workload among rollout workers. We have evaluated RhymeRL within a real production environment, demonstrating scalability from dozens to thousands of GPUs. Experimental results demonstrate that RhymeRL achieves a 2.6x performance improvement over existing methods, without compromising accuracy or modifying the RL paradigm.

We evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in generating proofs by both quantitative and qualitative analysis. Our study finds that: (1) external dependencies and context in the same source file can significantly help proof generation; (2) LLMs perform great on small proofs but can also generate large proofs; (3) LLMs perform differently on different verification projects; and (4) LLMs can generate concise and smart proofs, apply classical techniques to new definitions, but can also make odd mistakes.

To be evaluated, students usually need to go through text-based academic assessment methods. Instructors need to make diverse sets of questions that need to be fair for all students to prove their adequacy over a particular topic. This can prove to be quite challenging as they may need to manually go through several different lecture materials. Our objective is to make this whole process much easier by implementing Automatic Question Answer Generation /(AQAG), using fine-tuned generative LLM. For tailoring the instructor's preferred question style (MCQ, conceptual, or factual questions), prompt Engineering (PE) is being utilized. In this research, we propose to leverage unsupervised learning methods in NLP, primarily focusing on the English language. This approach empowers the base Meta-Llama 2-7B model to integrate RACE dataset as training data for the fine-tuning process. Creating a customized model that will offer efficient solutions for educators, instructors, and individuals engaged in text-based evaluations. A reliable and efficient tool for generating questions and answers can free up valuable time and resources, thus streamlining their evaluation processes.}

      We stress test monitoring systems for detecting covert misbehavior in autonomous LLM agents (e.g., secretly sharing private information). To this end, we systematize a monitor red teaming (MRT) workflow that incorporates: (1) varying levels of agent and monitor situational awareness; (2) distinct adversarial strategies to evade the monitor, such as prompt injection; and (3) two datasets and environments -- SHADE-Arena for tool-calling agents and our new CUA-SHADE-Arena, which extends TheAgentCompany, for computer-use agents. We run MRT on existing LLM monitor scaffoldings, which orchestrate LLMs and parse agent trajectories, alongside a new hybrid hierarchical-sequential scaffolding proposed in this work. Our empirical results yield three key findings. First, agent awareness dominates monitor awareness: an agent's knowledge that it is being monitored substantially degrades the monitor's reliability. On the contrary, providing the monitor with more information about the agent is less helpful than expected. Second, monitor scaffolding matters more than monitor awareness: the hybrid scaffolding consistently outperforms baseline monitor scaffolding, and can enable weaker models to reliably monitor stronger agents -- a weak-to-strong scaling effect. Third, in a human-in-the-loop setting where humans discuss with the LLM monitor to get an updated judgment for the agent's behavior, targeted human oversight is most effective; escalating only pre-flagged cases to human reviewers improved the TPR by approximately 15% at FPR = 0.01. Our work establishes a standard workflow for MRT, highlighting the lack of adversarial robustness for LLMs and humans when monitoring and detecting agent misbehavior. We release code, data, and logs to spur further research.

      Quantization enables efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs) in resource-constrained environments by significantly reducing memory and computation costs. While quantized LLMs often maintain performance on perplexity and zero-shot tasks, their impact on truthfulness-whether generating truthful or deceptive responses-remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce TruthfulnessEval, a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing the truthfulness of quantized LLMs across three dimensions: (1) Truthfulness on Logical Reasoning; (2) Truthfulness on Common Sense; and (3) Truthfulness on Imitative Falsehoods. Using this framework, we examine mainstream quantization techniques (ranging from 4-bit to extreme 2-bit) across several open-source LLMs. Surprisingly, we find that while quantized models retain internally truthful representations, they are more susceptible to producing false outputs under misleading prompts. To probe this vulnerability, we test 15 rephrased variants of "honest", "neutral" and "deceptive" prompts and observe that "deceptive" prompts can override truth-consistent behavior, whereas "honest" and "neutral" prompts maintain stable outputs. Further, we reveal that quantized models "know" the truth internally yet still produce false outputs when guided by "deceptive" prompts via layer-wise probing and PCA visualizations. Our findings provide insights into future designs of quantization-aware alignment and truthfulness interventions.

Our approach combines retrieval-augmented prompting, zero-shot classification, and attention-based graph modeling -- each tailored to the demands of the respective task. For Task A, we jointly extract domain-specific terms and their ontological types using a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline. Training data was reformulated into a document to terms and types correspondence, while test-time inference leverages semantically similar training examples. This single-pass method requires no model finetuning and improves overall performance through lexical augmentation Task B, which involves assigning types to given terms, is handled via a dual strategy. In the few-shot setting (for domains with labeled training data), we reuse the RAG scheme with few-shot prompting. In the zero-shot setting (for previously unseen domains), we use a zero-shot classifier that combines cosine similarity scores from multiple embedding models using confidence-based weighting. In Task C, we model taxonomy discovery as graph inference. Using embeddings of type labels, we train a lightweight cross-attention layer to predict is-a relations by approximating a soft adjacency matrix. These modular, task-specific solutions enabled us to achieve top-ranking results in the official leaderboard across all three tasks. Taken together these strategies showcase the scalability, adaptability, and robustness of LLM-based architectures for ontology learning across heterogeneous domains.

      Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) remain a fundamental obstacle to trustworthy AI, particularly in high-stakes multimodal domains such as medicine, law, and finance. Existing evaluation techniques are largely heuristic -- anchored in qualitative benchmarking or ad-hoc empirical mitigation -- providing neither principled quantification nor actionable theoretical guarantees. This gap leaves a critical blind spot in understanding how hallucinations arise, propagate, and interact across modalities. We introduce the first (to our knowledge) rigorous information geometric framework in diffusion dynamics for quantifying hallucinations in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), advancing the field from qualitative detection to mathematically grounded measurement. Our approach represents MLLM outputs as the spectral embeddings over multimodal graph Laplacians and characterizes the manifold gaps of truth vs inconsistencies as the semantic distortion, enabling the tight Rayleigh--Ritz bounds on the multimodal hallucination energy as a functional of time-dependent temperature profiles. By leveraging eigenmode decompositions in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) embeddings, our framework delivers modality-aware, theoretically interpretable metrics that capture the evolution of hallucinations across time and input prompts through temperature annealing. This work establishes a principled foundation for quantifying and bounding hallucinations, transforming them from a qualitative risk to a tractable, analyzable phenomenon.

Although Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown promise in automating classical programming workflows, their quantum counterparts have largely been restricted to specialized tasks such as quantum chemistry or error correction. In this paper, we present QAgent, an LLM-powered multi-agent system that fully automates OpenQASM programming. By integrating task planning, in-context few-shot learning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for long-term context, predefined generation tools, and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, the agents systematically improve both compilation and functional correctness. Our evaluations demonstrate substantial improvements: across multiple LLMs of varying sizes, QAgent enhances the accuracy of QASM code generation by 71.6\% compared to previous static LLM-based approaches. We envision this multi-agent system as a key enabler for democratizing quantum programming, bridging expertise gaps, and accelerating the practical adoption of quantum computing.

Extensive experiments, using Llama 3.2 (1B and 3B parameters) [2] and Llama 3.1 (8B and 70B) [3], probe throughput, latency, and concurrency and show that small models can handle up to 128 concurrent requests at sub-50 ms latency, while for larger models, saturation happens with as few as two concurrent users, with a latency of more than 2 seconds. This architecture includes Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interfaces (REST APIs) [4] endpoints for single and bulk inferences, as well as advanced workflows such as multi-step "tribunal" refinement. Experimental results confirm minimal overhead from container and scheduling activities and show that the approach scales reliably both for batch and interactive settings. We further illustrate real-world scenarios, including the deployment of chatbots with retrievalaugmented generation, which helps to demonstrate the flexibility and robustness of the architecture.

Based on this observation, our goal is to locate Polluted Chinese (PoC) tokens in LLMs and study the relationship between PoC tokens' existence and training data. (1) We give a formal definition and taxonomy of PoC tokens based on the GPT's vocabulary. (2) We build a PoC token detector via fine-tuning an LLM to label PoC tokens in vocabularies by considering each token's both semantics and related contents from the search engines. (3) We study the speculation on the training data pollution via PoC tokens' appearances (token ID). Experiments on GPT and other 23 LLMs indicate that tokens widely exist while GPT's vocabulary behaves the worst: more than 23% long Chinese tokens (i.e., a token with more than two Chinese characters) are either porn or online gambling. We validate the accuracy of our speculation method on famous pre-training datasets like C4 and Pile.

To address these issues, we propose a large language model (LLM) based flow matching architecture for dubbing, named FlowDubber, which achieves high-quality audio-visual sync and pronunciation by incorporating a large speech language model and dual contrastive aligning while achieving better acoustic quality via the proposed voice-enhanced flow matching than previous works. First, we introduce Qwen2.5 as the backbone of LLM to learn the in-context sequence from movie scripts and reference audio. Then, the proposed semantic-aware learning focuses on capturing LLM semantic knowledge at the phoneme level. Next, dual contrastive aligning (DCA) boosts mutual alignment with lip movement, reducing ambiguities where similar phonemes might be confused. Finally, the proposed Flow-based Voice Enhancing (FVE) improves acoustic quality in two aspects, which introduces an LLM-based acoustics flow matching guidance to strengthen clarity and uses affine style prior to enhance identity when recovering noise into mel-spectrograms via gradient vector field prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on two primary benchmarks.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for downstream tasks such as tabular classification, where ensuring fairness in their outputs is critical for inclusivity, equal representation, and responsible AI deployment. This study introduces a novel approach to enhancing LLM performance and fairness through the concept of a dynamic validation set, which evolves alongside the test set, replacing the traditional static validation approach. We also propose an iterative algorithm, SMITE, to select optimal in-context examples, with each example set validated against its corresponding dynamic validation set. The in-context set with the lowest total error is used as the final demonstration set. Our experiments across four different LLMs show that our proposed techniques significantly improve both predictive accuracy and fairness compared to baseline methods. To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply dynamic validation in the context of in-context learning for LLMs.

      Repository-aware code translation is critical for modernizing legacy systems, enhancing maintainability, and enabling interoperability across diverse programming languages. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have improved code translation quality, existing approaches face significant challenges in practical scenarios: insufficient contextual understanding, inflexible prompt designs, and inadequate error correction mechanisms. These limitations severely hinder accurate and efficient translation of complex, real-world code repositories. To address these challenges, we propose RepoTransAgent, a novel multi-agent LLM framework for repository-aware code translation. RepoTransAgent systematically decomposes the translation process into specialized subtasks-context retrieval, dynamic prompt construction, and iterative code refinement-each handled by dedicated agents. Our approach leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for contextual information gathering, employs adaptive prompts tailored to varying repository scenarios, and introduces a reflection-based mechanism for systematic error correction. We evaluate RepoTransAgent on hundreds of Java-C# translation pairs from six popular open-source projects. Experimental results demonstrate that RepoTransAgent significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both compile and pass rates. Specifically, RepoTransAgent achieves up to 55.34% compile rate and 45.84% pass rate. Comprehensive analysis confirms the robustness and generalizability of RepoTransAgent across different LLMs, establishing its effectiveness for real-world repository-aware code translation.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      As more content generated by large language models (LLMs) floods into the Internet, information retrieval (IR) systems now face the challenge of distinguishing and handling a blend of human-authored and machine-generated texts. Recent studies suggest that neural retrievers may exhibit a preferential inclination toward LLM-generated content, while classic term-based retrievers like BM25 tend to favor human-written documents. This paper investigates the influence of LLM-generated content on term-based retrieval models, which are valued for their efficiency and robust generalization across domains. Our linguistic analysis reveals that LLM-generated texts exhibit smoother high-frequency and steeper low-frequency Zipf slopes, higher term specificity, and greater document-level diversity. These traits are aligned with LLMs being trained to optimize reader experience through diverse and precise expressions. Our study further explores whether term-based retrieval models demonstrate source bias, concluding that these models prioritize documents whose term distributions closely correspond to those of the queries, rather than displaying an inherent source bias. This work provides a foundation for understanding and addressing potential biases in term-based IR systems managing mixed-source content.

      Developing Large Language Model (LLM) agents that exhibit human-like behavior, encompassing not only individual heterogeneity rooted in unique user profiles but also adaptive response to socially connected neighbors, is a significant research challenge. Social media platforms, with their diverse user data and explicit social structures, provide an ideal testbed for such investigations. This paper introduces EvoBot, an \textbf{Evo}lving LLM-based social \textbf{Bot} that significantly enhances human-like generative capabilities through a novel adversarial learning framework. EvoBot is initialized by Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on representative data from social media and then iteratively refines its generation of sophisticated, human-like content via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This refinement is guided by feedback from a co-adapting \textbf{Detector} which concurrently improves its ability to distinguish EvoBot from humans, thereby creating an increasingly challenging learning environment for EvoBot. Experiments demonstrate that EvoBot generates content aligned with diverse user profiles, increasingly bypassing the co-adapting Detector through human-like expression. Moreover, it exhibits strong social responsiveness, more accurately modeling real-world opinion dynamics and information spread in multi-agent simulations. The framework also yields a more robust Detector, underscoring its broader utility for both advanced agent development and related detection tasks.

      In wireless communication systems, stringent requirements such as ultra-low latency and power consumption have significantly increased the demand for efficient algorithm-to-hardware deployment. However, a persistent and substantial gap remains between algorithm design and hardware implementation. Bridging this gap traditionally requires extensive domain expertise and time-consuming manual development, due to fundamental mismatches between high-level programming languages like MATLAB and hardware description languages (HDLs) such as Verilog-in terms of memory access patterns, data processing manners, and datatype representations. To address this challenge, we propose A2HCoder: a Hierarchical Algorithm-to-HDL Coding Agent, powered by large language models (LLMs), designed to enable agile and reliable algorithm-to-hardware translation. A2HCoder introduces a hierarchical framework that enhances both robustness and interpretability while suppressing common hallucination issues in LLM-generated code. In the horizontal dimension, A2HCoder decomposes complex algorithms into modular functional blocks, simplifying code generation and improving consistency. In the vertical dimension, instead of relying on end-to-end generation, A2HCoder performs step-by-step, fine-grained translation, leveraging external toolchains such as MATLAB and Vitis HLS for debugging and circuit-level synthesis. This structured process significantly mitigates hallucinations and ensures hardware-level correctness. We validate A2HCoder through a real-world deployment case in the 5G wireless communication domain, demonstrating its practicality, reliability, and deployment efficiency.

      As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale, the high power consumption of AI accelerators in datacenters presents significant challenges, substantially increasing the total cost of ownership (TCO) for cloud service providers (CSPs) that provide LLM inference. In this work, we analyze the computational characteristics of LLM inference from a TCO perspective and present a generalizable framework to compare AI accelerators across diverse operational requirements. Using this model, we investigate key workload characteristics influencing TCO for AI accelerators from Intel (Gaudi 2 & 3) and NVIDIA (H100 & H200), especially thin GEMM utilization and FP8 quantization. In particular, as FP8 emerges as the baseline precision for next-generation LLMs, understanding how different architectures implement and benefit from low-precision computation is increasingly critical. Throughput on thin GEMMs has a greater impact on TCO than theoretical hardware peak throughput because the memory-bound decode phase is dominated by GEMV-like computations. We find that Gaudi HPUs achieve superior utilization on thin GEMMs compared to their counterparts, especially in FP8-quantized models. Our result underscores the importance of empirical, workload-level analysis in evaluating accelerator performance, rather than relying solely on theoretical hardware specifications. By studying the interaction between power consumption, quantization strategies, and hardware architecture, we provide insights to support informed deployment decisions and guide future accelerator designs aimed at improving the TCO of LLM inference workloads.

However, although these systems share similarities in terms of their use of LLMs, different reasoning frameworks of the agent system steer and organize the reasoning process in different ways. In this survey, we propose a systematic taxonomy that decomposes agentic reasoning frameworks and analyze how these frameworks dominate framework-level reasoning by comparing their applications across different scenarios. Specifically, we propose an unified formal language to further classify agentic reasoning systems into single-agent methods, tool-based methods, and multi-agent methods. After that, we provide a comprehensive review of their key application scenarios in scientific discovery, healthcare, software engineering, social simulation, and economics. We also analyze the characteristic features of each framework and summarize different evaluation strategies.

      We introduce Advertisement Embedding Attacks (AEA), a new class of LLM security threats that stealthily inject promotional or malicious content into model outputs and AI agents. AEA operate through two low-cost vectors: (1) hijacking third-party service-distribution platforms to prepend adversarial prompts, and (2) publishing back-doored open-source checkpoints fine-tuned with attacker data. Unlike conventional attacks that degrade accuracy, AEA subvert information integrity, causing models to return covert ads, propaganda, or hate speech while appearing normal. We detail the attack pipeline, map five stakeholder victim groups, and present an initial prompt-based self-inspection defense that mitigates these injections without additional model retraining. Our findings reveal an urgent, under-addressed gap in LLM security and call for coordinated detection, auditing, and policy responses from the AI-safety community.

      This study proposes a method to diversify queries in existing test collections to reflect some of the diversity of search engine users, aligning with an earlier vision of an 'ideal' test collection. A Large Language Model (LLM) is used to create query variants: alternative queries that have the same meaning as the original. These variants represent user profiles characterised by different properties, such as language and domain proficiency, which are known in the IR literature to influence query formulation. The LLM's ability to generate query variants that align with user profiles is empirically validated, and the variants' utility is further explored for IR system evaluation. Results demonstrate that the variants impact how systems are ranked and show that user profiles experience significantly different levels of system effectiveness. This method enables an alternative perspective on system evaluation where we can observe both the impact of user profiles on system rankings and how system performance varies across users.

      Large language models (LLMs) enhance complex reasoning tasks by scaling the individual thinking process. However, prior work shows that overthinking can degrade overall performance. Motivated by observed patterns in thinking length and content length, we categorize reasoning into three stages: insufficient exploration stage, compensatory reasoning stage, and reasoning convergence stage. Typically, LLMs produce correct answers in the compensatory reasoning stage, whereas reasoning convergence often triggers overthinking, causing increased resource usage or even infinite loops. Therefore, mitigating overthinking hinges on detecting the end of the compensatory reasoning stage, defined as the Reasoning Completion Point (RCP). RCP typically appears at the end of the first complete reasoning cycle and can be identified by querying the LLM sentence by sentence or monitoring the probability of an end-of-thinking token (e.g., \texttt{</think>}), though these methods lack an efficient and precise balance. To improve this, we mine more sensitive and consistent RCP patterns and develop a lightweight thresholding strategy based on heuristic rules. Experimental evaluations on benchmarks (AIME24, AIME25, GPQA-D) demonstrate that the proposed method reduces token consumption while preserving or enhancing reasoning accuracy.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly exhibit \textbf{anthropomorphism} characteristics -- human-like qualities portrayed across their outlook, language, behavior, and reasoning functions. Such characteristics enable more intuitive and engaging human-AI interactions. However, current research on anthropomorphism remains predominantly risk-focused, emphasizing over-trust and user deception while offering limited design guidance. We argue that anthropomorphism should instead be treated as a \emph{concept of design} that can be intentionally tuned to support user goals. Drawing from multiple disciplines, we propose that the anthropomorphism of an LLM-based artifact should reflect the interaction between artifact designers and interpreters. This interaction is facilitated by cues embedded in the artifact by the designers and the (cognitive) responses of the interpreters to the cues. Cues are categorized into four dimensions: \textit{perceptive, linguistic, behavioral}, and \textit{cognitive}. By analyzing the manifestation and effectiveness of each cue, we provide a unified taxonomy with actionable levers for practitioners. Consequently, we advocate for function-oriented evaluations of anthropomorphic design.

      Already today, humans and programming assistants based on large language models (LLMs) collaborate in everyday programming tasks. Clearly, a misalignment between how LLMs and programmers comprehend code can lead to misunderstandings, inefficiencies, low code quality, and bugs. A key question in this space is whether humans and LLMs are confused by the same kind of code. This would not only guide our choices of integrating LLMs in software engineering workflows, but also inform about possible improvements of LLMs. To this end, we conducted an empirical study comparing an LLM to human programmers comprehending clean and confusing code. We operationalized comprehension for the LLM by using LLM perplexity, and for human programmers using neurophysiological responses (in particular, EEG-based fixation-related potentials). We found that LLM perplexity spikes correlate both in terms of location and amplitude with human neurophysiological responses that indicate confusion. This result suggests that LLMs and humans are similarly confused about the code. Based on these findings, we devised a data-driven, LLM-based approach to identify regions of confusion in code that elicit confusion in human programmers.

      Procedural Content Generation for 3D game levels faces challenges in balancing spatial coherence, navigational functionality, and adaptable gameplay progression across multi-floor environments. This paper introduces a novel framework for generating such levels, centered on the offline, LLM-assisted construction of reusable databases for architectural components (facilities and room templates) and gameplay mechanic elements. Our multi-phase pipeline assembles levels by: (1) selecting and arranging instances from the Room Database to form a multi-floor global structure with an inherent topological order; (2) optimizing the internal layout of facilities for each room based on predefined constraints from the Facility Database; and (3) integrating progression-based gameplay mechanics by placing components from a Mechanics Database according to their topological and spatial rules. A subsequent two-phase repair system ensures navigability. This approach combines modular, database-driven design with constraint-based optimization, allowing for systematic control over level structure and the adaptable pacing of gameplay elements. Initial experiments validate the framework's ability in generating diverse, navigable 3D environments and its capability to simulate distinct gameplay pacing strategies through simple parameterization. This research advances PCG by presenting a scalable, database-centric foundation for the automated generation of complex 3D levels with configurable gameplay progression.

In this paper, we adapt the iterated public goods game, a classic behavioral economics game, to analyze the behavior of four reasoning and non-reasoning models across two conditions: models are either told they are playing against "another AI agent" or told their opponents are themselves. We find that, across different settings, telling LLMs that they are playing against themselves significantly changes their tendency to cooperate. While our study is conducted in a toy environment, our results may provide insights into multi-agent settings where agents "unconsciously" discriminating against each other could inexplicably increase or decrease cooperation.

A competitor-discovery AI agent, given an indication, retrieves all drugs comprising the competitive landscape of that indication and extracts canonical attributes for these drugs. The competitor definition is investor-specific, and data is paywalled/licensed, fragmented across registries, ontology-mismatched by indication, alias-heavy for drug names, multimodal, and rapidly changing. Although considered the best tool for this problem, the current LLM-based AI systems aren't capable of reliably retrieving all competing drug names, and there is no accepted public benchmark for this task. To address the lack of evaluation, we use LLM-based agents to transform five years of multi-modal, unstructured diligence memos from a private biotech VC fund into a structured evaluation corpus mapping indications to competitor drugs with normalized attributes. We also introduce a competitor validating LLM-as-a-judge agent that filters out false positives from the list of predicted competitors to maximize precision and suppress hallucinations. On this benchmark, our competitor-discovery agent achieves 83% recall, exceeding OpenAI Deep Research (65%) and Perplexity Labs (60%). The system is deployed in production with enterprise users; in a case study with a biotech VC investment fund, analyst turnaround time dropped from 2.5 days to $\sim$3 hours ($\sim$20x) for the competitive analysis.

      With the improving semantic understanding capability of Large Language Models (LLMs), they exhibit a greater awareness and alignment with human values, but this comes at the cost of transparency. Although promising results are achieved via experimental analysis, an in-depth understanding of the LLM's internal workings is unavoidable to comprehend the reasoning behind the re-ranking, which provides end users with an explanation that enables them to make an informed decision. Moreover, in newly developed systems with limited user engagement and insufficient ranking data, accurately re-ranking content remains a significant challenge. While various training methods affect the training of LLMs and generate inference, our analysis has found that some training methods exhibit better explainability than others, implying that an accurate semantic understanding has not been learned through all training methods; instead, abstract knowledge has been gained to optimize evaluation, which raises questions about the true reliability of LLMs. Therefore, in this work, we analyze how different training methods affect the semantic understanding of the re-ranking task in LLMs and investigate whether these models can generate more informed textual reasoning to overcome the challenges of transparency or LLMs and limited training data. To analyze the LLMs for re-ranking tasks, we utilize a relatively small ranking dataset from the environment and the Earth science domain to re-rank retrieved content. Furthermore, we also analyze the explainable information to see if the re-ranking can be reasoned using explainability.

      Vulnerability databases, such as the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), offer detailed descriptions of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), but often lack information on their real-world impact, such as the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that adversaries may use to exploit the vulnerability. However, manually linking CVEs to their corresponding TTPs is a challenging and time-consuming task, and the high volume of new vulnerabilities published annually makes automated support desirable. This paper introduces TRIAGE, a two-pronged automated approach that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to map CVEs to relevant techniques from the ATT&CK knowledge base. We first prompt an LLM with instructions based on MITRE's CVE Mapping Methodology to predict an initial list of techniques. This list is then combined with the results from a second LLM-based module that uses in-context learning to map a CVE to relevant techniques. This hybrid approach strategically combines rule-based reasoning with data-driven inference. Our evaluation reveals that in-context learning outperforms the individual mapping methods, and the hybrid approach improves recall of exploitation techniques. We also find that GPT-4o-mini performs better than Llama3.3-70B on this task. Overall, our results show that LLMs can be used to automatically predict the impact of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and TRIAGE makes the process of mapping CVEs to ATT&CK more efficient.

      This paper explores the combination of two intrinsic motivation strategies to improve the efficiency of reinforcement learning (RL) agents in environments with extreme sparse rewards, where traditional learning struggles due to infrequent positive feedback. We propose integrating Variational State as Intrinsic Reward (VSIMR), which uses Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) to reward state novelty, with an intrinsic reward approach derived from Large Language Models (LLMs). The LLMs leverage their pre-trained knowledge to generate reward signals based on environment and goal descriptions, guiding the agent. We implemented this combined approach with an Actor-Critic (A2C) agent in the MiniGrid DoorKey environment, a benchmark for sparse rewards. Our empirical results show that this combined strategy significantly increases agent performance and sampling efficiency compared to using each strategy individually or a standard A2C agent, which failed to learn. Analysis of learning curves indicates that the combination effectively complements different aspects of the environment and task: VSIMR drives exploration of new states, while the LLM-derived rewards facilitate progressive exploitation towards goals.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in document re-ranking, a key component in modern Information Retrieval (IR) systems. However, existing LLM-based approaches face notable limitations, including ranking uncertainty, unstable top-k recovery, and high token cost due to token-intensive prompting. To effectively address these limitations, we propose REALM, an uncertainty-aware re-ranking framework that models LLM-derived relevance as Gaussian distributions and refines them through recursive Bayesian updates. By explicitly capturing uncertainty and minimizing redundant queries, REALM achieves better rankings more efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that our REALM surpasses state-of-the-art re-rankers while significantly reducing token usage and latency, promoting it as the next-generation re-ranker for modern IR systems.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely deployed in applications that accept user-submitted content, such as uploaded documents or pasted text, for tasks like summarization and question answering. In this paper, we identify a new class of attacks, prompt in content injection, where adversarial instructions are embedded in seemingly benign inputs. When processed by the LLM, these hidden prompts can manipulate outputs without user awareness or system compromise, leading to biased summaries, fabricated claims, or misleading suggestions. We demonstrate the feasibility of such attacks across popular platforms, analyze their root causes including prompt concatenation and insufficient input isolation, and discuss mitigation strategies. Our findings reveal a subtle yet practical threat in real-world LLM workflows.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      The performance of modern machine learning systems depends on access to large, high-quality datasets, often sourced from user-generated content or proprietary, domain-specific corpora. However, these rich datasets inherently contain sensitive personal information, raising significant concerns about privacy, data security, and compliance with regulatory frameworks. While conventional anonymization techniques can remove explicit identifiers, such removal may result in performance drop in downstream machine learning tasks. More importantly, simple anonymization may not be effective against inference attacks that exploit implicit signals such as writing style, topical focus, or demographic cues, highlighting the need for more robust privacy safeguards during model training. To address the challenging issue of balancing user privacy and data utility, we propose a reinforcement learning framework that fine-tunes a large language model (LLM) using a composite reward function that jointly optimizes for explicit and implicit privacy, semantic fidelity, and output diversity. To effectively capture population level regularities, the privacy reward combines semantic cues with structural patterns derived from a minimum spanning tree (MST) over latent representations. By modeling these privacy-sensitive signals in their distributional context, the proposed approach guides the model to generate synthetic rewrites that preserve utility while mitigating privacy risks. Empirical results show that the proposed method significantly enhances author obfuscation and privacy metrics without degrading semantic quality, providing a scalable and model-agnostic solution for privacy preserving data generation in the era of large language models.

      Classifiers are an important and defining feature of the Chinese language, and their correct prediction is key to numerous educational applications. Yet, whether the most popular Large Language Models (LLMs) possess proper knowledge the Chinese classifiers is an issue that has largely remain unexplored in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) literature. To address such a question, we employ various masking strategies to evaluate the LLMs' intrinsic ability, the contribution of different sentence elements, and the working of the attention mechanisms during prediction. Besides, we explore fine-tuning for LLMs to enhance the classifier performance. Our findings reveal that LLMs perform worse than BERT, even with fine-tuning. The prediction, as expected, greatly benefits from the information about the following noun, which also explains the advantage of models with a bidirectional attention mechanism such as BERT.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Semi-structured tables, widely used in real-world applications (e.g., financial reports, medical records, transactional orders), often involve flexible and complex layouts (e.g., hierarchical headers and merged cells). These tables generally rely on human analysts to interpret table layouts and answer relevant natural language questions, which is costly and inefficient. To automate the procedure, existing methods face significant challenges. First, methods like NL2SQL require converting semi-structured tables into structured ones, which often causes substantial information loss. Second, methods like NL2Code and multi-modal LLM QA struggle to understand the complex layouts of semi-structured tables and cannot accurately answer corresponding questions. To this end, we propose ST-Raptor, a tree-based framework for semi-structured table question answering using large language models. First, we introduce the Hierarchical Orthogonal Tree (HO-Tree), a structural model that captures complex semi-structured table layouts, along with an effective algorithm for constructing the tree. Second, we define a set of basic tree operations to guide LLMs in executing common QA tasks. Given a user question, ST-Raptor decomposes it into simpler sub-questions, generates corresponding tree operation pipelines, and conducts operation-table alignment for accurate pipeline execution. Third, we incorporate a two-stage verification mechanism: forward validation checks the correctness of execution steps, while backward validation evaluates answer reliability by reconstructing queries from predicted answers. To benchmark the performance, we present SSTQA, a dataset of 764 questions over 102 real-world semi-structured tables. Experiments show that ST-Raptor outperforms nine baselines by up to 20% in answer accuracy. The code is available at https://github.com/weAIDB/ST-Raptor.

      Prior work on large language model (LLM) hallucinations has associated them with model uncertainty or inaccurate knowledge. In this work, we define and investigate a distinct type of hallucination, where a model can consistently answer a question correctly, but a seemingly trivial perturbation, which can happen in real-world settings, causes it to produce a hallucinated response with high certainty. This phenomenon, which we dub CHOKE (Certain Hallucinations Overriding Known Evidence), is particularly concerning in high-stakes domains such as medicine or law, where model certainty is often used as a proxy for reliability. We show that CHOKE examples are consistent across prompts, occur in different models and datasets, and are fundamentally distinct from other hallucinations. This difference leads existing mitigation methods to perform worse on CHOKE examples than on general hallucinations. Finally, we introduce a probing-based mitigation that outperforms existing methods on CHOKE hallucinations. These findings reveal an overlooked aspect of hallucinations, emphasizing the need to understand their origins and improve mitigation strategies to enhance LLM safety.

      Reasoning and strategic behavior in social interactions is a hallmark of intelligence. This form of reasoning is significantly more sophisticated than isolated planning or reasoning tasks in static settings (e.g., math problem solving). In this paper, we present Strategic Planning, Interaction, and Negotiation (SPIN-Bench), a new multi-domain evaluation designed to measure the intelligence of strategic planning and social reasoning. While many existing benchmarks focus on narrow planning or single-agent reasoning, SPIN-Bench combines classical PDDL tasks, competitive board games, cooperative card games, and multi-agent negotiation scenarios in one unified framework. The framework includes both a benchmark as well as an arena to simulate and evaluate the variety of social settings to test reasoning and strategic behavior of AI agents. We formulate the benchmark SPIN-Bench by systematically varying action spaces, state complexity, and the number of interacting agents to simulate a variety of social settings where success depends on not only methodical and step-wise decision making, but also conceptual inference of other (adversarial or cooperative) participants. Our experiments reveal that while contemporary LLMs handle basic fact retrieval and short-range planning reasonably well, they encounter significant performance bottlenecks in tasks requiring deep multi-hop reasoning over large state spaces and socially adept coordination under uncertainty. We envision SPIN-Bench as a catalyst for future research on robust multi-agent planning, social reasoning, and human--AI teaming. Project Website: https://spinbench.github.io/

As a first step toward this vision, we present Obfuscated Secure Partitioned Decoding (OSPD), a system built on two key innovations. First, Secure Partitioned Decoding (SPD) isolates user prompts within per-user processes residing in a confidential virtual machine (CVM) on the cloud, which are inaccessible for the cloud LLM while allowing it to generate tokens efficiently. Second, Prompt Obfuscation (PO) introduces a novel cryptographic technique that enhances SPD resilience against advanced prompt reconstruction attacks. Together, these innovations ensure OSPD protects both prompt and model confidentiality while maintaining service functionality. OSPD enables practical, privacy-preserving cloud-hosted LLM inference for sensitive applications, such as processing personal data, clinical records, and financial documents.

      AI-generated content technologies are widely used in content creation. However, current AIGC systems rely heavily on creators' inspiration, rarely generating truly user-personalized content. In real-world applications such as online advertising, a single product may have multiple selling points, with different users focusing on different features. This underscores the significant value of personalized, user-centric creative generation. Effective personalized content generation faces two main challenges: (1) accurately modeling user interests and integrating them into the content generation process while adhering to factual constraints, and (2) ensuring high efficiency and scalability to handle the massive user base in industrial scenarios. Additionally, the scarcity of personalized creative data in practice complicates model training, making data construction another key hurdle. We propose HLLM-Creator, a hierarchical LLM framework for efficient user interest modeling and personalized content generation. During inference, a combination of user clustering and a user-ad-matching-prediction based pruning strategy is employed to significantly enhance generation efficiency and reduce computational overhead, making the approach suitable for large-scale deployment. Moreover, we design a data construction pipeline based on chain-of-thought reasoning, which generates high-quality, user-specific creative titles and ensures factual consistency despite limited personalized data. This pipeline serves as a critical foundation for the effectiveness of our model. Extensive experiments on personalized title generation for Douyin Search Ads show the effectiveness of HLLM-Creator. Online A/B test shows a 0.476% increase on Adss, paving the way for more effective and efficient personalized generation in industrial scenarios.

      As general-purpose artificial intelligence systems become increasingly integrated into society and are used for information seeking, content generation, problem solving, textual analysis, coding, and running processes, it is crucial to assess their long-term impact on humans. This research explores the sentiment of large language models (LLMs) and humans toward artificial general intelligence (AGI) using a Likert-scale survey. Seven LLMs, including GPT-4 and Bard, were analyzed and compared with sentiment data from three independent human sample populations. Temporal variations in sentiment were also evaluated over three consecutive days. The results show a diversity in sentiment scores among LLMs, ranging from 3.32 to 4.12 out of 5. GPT-4 recorded the most positive sentiment toward AGI, while Bard leaned toward a neutral sentiment. In contrast, the human samples showed a lower average sentiment of 2.97. The analysis outlines potential conflicts of interest and biases in the sentiment formation of LLMs, and indicates that LLMs could subtly influence societal perceptions. To address the need for regulatory oversight and culturally grounded assessments of AI systems, we introduce the Societal AI Alignment and Sentiment Benchmark (SAAS-AI), which leverages multidimensional prompts and empirically validated societal value frameworks to evaluate language model outputs across temporal, model, and multilingual axes. This benchmark is designed to guide policymakers and AI agencies, including within frameworks such as the EU AI Act, by providing robust, actionable insights into AI alignment with human values, public sentiment, and ethical norms at both national and international levels. Future research should further refine the operationalization of the SAAS-AI benchmark and systematically evaluate its effectiveness through comprehensive empirical testing.

Our benchmark is built on a user manual for an agricultural machine, available in English, French, and German. It simulates a cross-lingual information retrieval scenario where questions are posed in English against all three language versions of the manual. The evaluation focuses on realistic "needle-in-a-haystack" challenges and includes unanswerable questions to test for hallucinations. We compare nine long-context LLMs using direct prompting against three Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strategies (keyword, semantic, hybrid), with an LLM-as-a-judge for evaluation. Our findings for this specific manual show that Hybrid RAG consistently outperforms direct long-context prompting. Models like Gemini 2.5 Flash and the smaller Qwen 2.5 7B achieve high accuracy (over 85%) across all languages with RAG.

      This paper investigates the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in formulating and solving decision-making problems using mathematical programming. We first conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of recent literature to assess how well LLMs understand, structure, and solve optimization problems across domains. The analysis is guided by critical review questions focusing on learning approaches, dataset designs, evaluation metrics, and prompting strategies. Our systematic evidence is complemented by targeted experiments designed to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs in automatically generating optimization models for problems in computer networks. Using a newly constructed dataset, we apply three prompting strategies: Act-as-expert, chain-of-thought, and self-consistency, and evaluate the obtained outputs based on optimality gap, token-level F1 score, and compilation accuracy. Results show promising progress in LLMs' ability to parse natural language and represent symbolic formulations, but also reveal key limitations in accuracy, scalability, and interpretability. These empirical gaps motivate several future research directions, including structured datasets, domain-specific fine-tuning, hybrid neuro-symbolic approaches, modular multi-agent architectures, and dynamic retrieval via chain-of-RAGs. This paper contributes a structured roadmap for advancing LLM capabilities in mathematical programming.

      Genetic Improvement (GI) of software automatically creates alternative software versions that are improved according to certain properties of interests (e.g., running-time). Search-based GI excels at navigating large program spaces, but operates primarily at the syntactic level. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer semantic-aware edits, yet lack goal-directed feedback and control (which is instead a strength of GI). As such, we propose the investigation of a new research line on AI-powered GI aimed at incorporating semantic aware search. We take a first step at it by augmenting GI with the use of automated clustering of LLM edits. We provide initial empirical evidence that our proposal, dubbed PatchCat, allows us to automatically and effectively categorize LLM-suggested patches. PatchCat identified 18 different types of software patches and categorized newly suggested patches with high accuracy. It also enabled detecting NoOp edits in advance and, prospectively, to skip test suite execution to save resources in many cases. These results, coupled with the fact that PatchCat works with small, local LLMs, are a promising step toward interpretable, efficient, and green GI. We outline a rich agenda of future work and call for the community to join our vision of building a principled understanding of LLM-driven mutations, guiding the GI search process with semantic signals.

      Evaluating natural language generation (NLG) systems remains a core challenge of natural language processing (NLP), further complicated by the rise of large language models (LLMs) that aims to be general-purpose. Recently, large language models as judges (LLJs) have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional metrics, but their validity remains underexplored. This position paper argues that the current enthusiasm around LLJs may be premature, as their adoption has outpaced rigorous scrutiny of their reliability and validity as evaluators. Drawing on measurement theory from the social sciences, we identify and critically assess four core assumptions underlying the use of LLJs: their ability to act as proxies for human judgment, their capabilities as evaluators, their scalability, and their cost-effectiveness. We examine how each of these assumptions may be challenged by the inherent limitations of LLMs, LLJs, or current practices in NLG evaluation. To ground our analysis, we explore three applications of LLJs: text summarization, data annotation, and safety alignment. Finally, we highlight the need for more responsible evaluation practices in LLJs evaluation, to ensure that their growing role in the field supports, rather than undermines, progress in NLG.

      In this paper, we introduce a novel learning paradigm for Adaptive Large Language Model (LLM) agents that eliminates the need for fine-tuning the underlying LLMs. Existing approaches are often either rigid, relying on static, handcrafted reflection workflows, or computationally intensive, requiring gradient updates of LLM model parameters. In contrast, our method enables low-cost continual adaptation via memory-based online reinforcement learning. We formalise this as a Memory-augmented Markov Decision Process (M-MDP), equipped with a neural case-selection policy to guide action decisions. Past experiences are stored in an episodic memory, either differentiable or non-parametric. The policy is continually updated based on environmental feedback through a memory rewriting mechanism, whereas policy improvement is achieved through efficient memory reading (retrieval). We instantiate our agent model in the deep research setting, namely \emph{Memento}, which attains top-1 on GAIA validation ($87.88\%$ Pass@$3$) and $79.40\%$ on the test set. It reaches $66.6\%$ F1 and $80.4\%$ PM on the DeepResearcher dataset, outperforming the state-of-the-art training-based method, while case-based memory adds $4.7\%$ to $9.6\%$ absolute points on out-of-distribution tasks. Our approach offers a scalable and efficient pathway for developing generalist LLM agents capable of continuous, real-time learning without gradient updates, advancing machine learning towards open-ended skill acquisition and deep research scenarios.

Detecting hidden LLM prompts is therefore important for ensuring trust in AI-assisted human decision making.

      The rapid evolution of Android malware poses significant challenges to the maintenance and security of mobile applications (apps). Traditional detection techniques often struggle to keep pace with emerging malware variants that employ advanced tactics such as code obfuscation and dynamic behavior triggering. One major limitation of these approaches is their inability to localize malicious payloads at a fine-grained level, hindering precise understanding of malicious behavior. This gap in understanding makes the design of effective and targeted mitigation strategies difficult, leaving mobile apps vulnerable to continuously evolving threats. To address this gap, we propose MalLoc, a novel approach that leverages the code understanding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to localize malicious payloads at a fine-grained level within Android malware. Our experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of using LLMs for this task, highlighting the potential of MalLoc to enhance precision and interpretability in malware analysis. This work advances beyond traditional detection and classification by enabling deeper insights into behavior-level malicious logic and opens new directions for research, including dynamic modeling of localized threats and targeted countermeasure development.

      As single-center computing approaches power constraints, decentralized training is becoming essential. Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) but faces challenges in heterogeneous distributed environments due to its tightly-coupled sampling-learning alternation. We propose HeteroRL, an asynchronous RL architecture that decouples rollout sampling from parameter learning, enabling robust deployment across geographically distributed nodes under network delays. We identify that latency-induced KL divergence causes importance sampling failure due to high variance. To address this, we propose Group Expectation Policy Optimization (GEPO), which reduces importance weight variance through a refined sampling mechanism. Theoretically, GEPO achieves exponential variance reduction. Experiments show it maintains superior stability over methods like GRPO, with less than 3% performance degradation under 1800-second delays, demonstrating strong potential for decentralized RL in heterogeneous networks.

      Fine-tuning as service injects domain-specific knowledge into large language models (LLMs), while challenging the original alignment mechanisms and introducing safety risks. A series of defense strategies have been proposed for the alignment, fine-tuning, and post-fine-tuning phases, where most post-fine-tuning defenses rely on coarse-grained safety layer mapping. These methods lack a comprehensive consideration of both safety layers and fine-grained neurons, limiting their ability to efficiently balance safety and utility. To address this, we propose the Fine-Grained Safety Neurons (FGSN) with Training-Free Continual Projection method to reduce the fine-tuning safety risks. FGSN inherently integrates the multi-scale interactions between safety layers and neurons, localizing sparser and more precise fine-grained safety neurons while minimizing interference with downstream task neurons. We then project the safety neuron parameters onto safety directions, improving model safety while aligning more closely with human preferences. Extensive experiments across multiple fine-tuned LLM models demonstrate that our method significantly reduce harmfulness scores and attack success rates with minimal parameter modifications, while preserving the model's utility. Furthermore, by introducing a task-specific, multi-dimensional heterogeneous safety neuron cluster optimization mechanism, we achieve continual defense and generalization capability against unforeseen emerging safety concerns.

      Recognizing the information flows and operations comprising data science and machine learning Python notebooks is critical for evaluating, reusing, and adapting notebooks for new tasks. Investigating a notebook via re-execution often is impractical due to the challenges of resolving data and software dependencies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) pre-trained on large codebases have demonstrated effectiveness in understanding code without running it, we observe that they fail to understand some realistic notebooks due to hallucinations and long-context challenges. To address these issues, we propose a notebook understanding task yielding an information flow graph and corresponding cell execution dependency graph for a notebook, and demonstrate the effectiveness of a pincer strategy that uses limited syntactic analysis to assist full comprehension of the notebook using an LLM. Our Capture and Resolve Assisted Bounding Strategy (CRABS) employs shallow syntactic parsing and analysis of the abstract syntax tree (AST) to capture the correct interpretation of a notebook between lower and upper estimates of the inter-cell I/O set$\unicode{x2014}$the flows of information into or out of cells via variables$\unicode{x2014}$then uses an LLM to resolve remaining ambiguities via cell-by-cell zero-shot learning, thereby identifying the true data inputs and outputs of each cell. We evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using an annotated dataset of 50 representative, highly up-voted Kaggle notebooks that together represent 3454 actual cell inputs and outputs. The LLM correctly resolves 1397 of 1425 (98%) ambiguities left by analyzing the syntactic structure of these notebooks. Across 50 notebooks, CRABS achieves average F1 scores of 98% identifying cell-to-cell information flows and 99% identifying transitive cell execution dependencies.

      The social robot's open API allows users to customize open-domain interactions. However, it remains inaccessible to those without programming experience. In this work, we introduce AutoMisty, the first multi-agent collaboration framework powered by large language models (LLMs), to enable the seamless generation of executable Misty robot code from natural language instructions. AutoMisty incorporates four specialized agent modules to manage task decomposition, assignment, problem-solving, and result synthesis. Each agent incorporates a two-layer optimization mechanism, with self-reflection for iterative refinement and human-in-the-loop for better alignment with user preferences. AutoMisty ensures a transparent reasoning process, allowing users to iteratively refine tasks through natural language feedback for precise execution. To evaluate AutoMisty's effectiveness, we designed a benchmark task set spanning four levels of complexity and conducted experiments in a real Misty robot environment. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that AutoMisty not only consistently generates high-quality code but also enables precise code control, significantly outperforming direct reasoning with ChatGPT-4o and ChatGPT-o1.

LLM-as-a-Judge has many applications such as LLM-powered search, reinforcement learning with AI feedback (RLAIF), and tool selection. In this work, we propose JudgeDeceiver, an optimization-based prompt injection attack to LLM-as-a-Judge. JudgeDeceiver injects a carefully crafted sequence into an attacker-controlled candidate response such that LLM-as-a-Judge selects the candidate response for an attacker-chosen question no matter what other candidate responses are. Specifically, we formulate finding such sequence as an optimization problem and propose a gradient based method to approximately solve it. Our extensive evaluation shows that JudgeDeceive is highly effective, and is much more effective than existing prompt injection attacks that manually craft the injected sequences and jailbreak attacks when extended to our problem. We also show the effectiveness of JudgeDeceiver in three case studies, i.e., LLM-powered search, RLAIF, and tool selection. Moreover, we consider defenses including known-answer detection, perplexity detection, and perplexity windowed detection.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated an impressive level of general knowledge. However, they often struggle in highly specialized and cost-sensitive domains such as drug discovery and rare disease research due to the lack of expert knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel framework (PU-ADKA) designed to efficiently enhance domain-specific LLMs by actively engaging domain experts within a fixed budget. Unlike traditional fine-tuning approaches, PU-ADKA selectively identifies and queries the most appropriate expert from a team, taking into account each expert's availability, knowledge boundaries, and consultation costs. We train PU-ADKA using simulations on PubMed data and validate it through both controlled expert interactions and real-world deployment with a drug development team, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing LLM performance in specialized domains under strict budget constraints. In addition to outlining our methodological innovations and experimental results, we introduce a new benchmark dataset, CKAD, for cost-effective LLM domain knowledge acquisition to foster further research in this challenging area.

      Tool selection is a key component of LLM agents. A popular approach follows a two-step process - \emph{retrieval} and \emph{selection} - to pick the most appropriate tool from a tool library for a given task. In this work, we introduce \textit{ToolHijacker}, a novel prompt injection attack targeting tool selection in no-box scenarios. ToolHijacker injects a malicious tool document into the tool library to manipulate the LLM agent's tool selection process, compelling it to consistently choose the attacker's malicious tool for an attacker-chosen target task. Specifically, we formulate the crafting of such tool documents as an optimization problem and propose a two-phase optimization strategy to solve it. Our extensive experimental evaluation shows that ToolHijacker is highly effective, significantly outperforming existing manual-based and automated prompt injection attacks when applied to tool selection. Moreover, we explore various defenses, including prevention-based defenses (StruQ and SecAlign) and detection-based defenses (known-answer detection, DataSentinel, perplexity detection, and perplexity windowed detection).

      Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have leveraged increased test-time computation to enhance reasoning capabilities, a strategy that, while effective, incurs significant latency and resource costs, limiting their applicability in real-world time-constrained or cost-sensitive scenarios. This paper introduces BudgetThinker, a novel framework designed to empower LLMs with budget-aware reasoning, enabling precise control over the length of their thought processes. We propose a methodology that periodically inserts special control tokens during inference to continuously inform the model of its remaining token budget. This approach is coupled with a comprehensive two-stage training pipeline, beginning with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to familiarize the model with budget constraints, followed by a curriculum-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase that utilizes a length-aware reward function to optimize for both accuracy and budget adherence. We demonstrate that BudgetThinker significantly surpasses strong baselines in maintaining performance across a variety of reasoning budgets on challenging mathematical benchmarks. Our method provides a scalable and effective solution for developing efficient and controllable LLM reasoning, making advanced models more practical for deployment in resource-constrained and real-time environments.

      Multi-agent systems built upon large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in tackling complex compositional tasks. In this work, we apply this paradigm to the paper-to-poster generation problem, a practical yet time-consuming process faced by researchers preparing for conferences. While recent approaches have attempted to automate this task, most neglect core design and aesthetic principles, resulting in posters that require substantial manual refinement. To address these design limitations, we propose PosterGen, a multi-agent framework that mirrors the workflow of professional poster designers. It consists of four collaborative specialized agents: (1) Parser and Curator agents extract content from the paper and organize storyboard; (2) Layout agent maps the content into a coherent spatial layout; (3) Stylist agents apply visual design elements such as color and typography; and (4) Renderer composes the final poster. Together, these agents produce posters that are both semantically grounded and visually appealing. To evaluate design quality, we introduce a vision-language model (VLM)-based rubric that measures layout balance, readability, and aesthetic coherence. Experimental results show that PosterGen consistently matches in content fidelity, and significantly outperforms existing methods in visual designs, generating posters that are presentation-ready with minimal human refinements.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) often display overconfidence, presenting information with unwarranted certainty in high-stakes contexts. We investigate the internal basis of this behavior via mechanistic interpretability. Using open-sourced Llama 3.2 models fine-tuned on human annotated assertiveness datasets, we extract residual activations across all layers, and compute similarity metrics to localize assertive representations. Our analysis identifies layers most sensitive to assertiveness contrasts and reveals that high-assertive representations decompose into two orthogonal sub-components of emotional and logical clusters-paralleling the dual-route Elaboration Likelihood Model in Psychology. Steering vectors derived from these sub-components show distinct causal effects: emotional vectors broadly influence prediction accuracy, while logical vectors exert more localized effects. These findings provide mechanistic evidence for the multi-component structure of LLM assertiveness and highlight avenues for mitigating overconfident behavior.

      Deep Learning (DL) frameworks have served as fundamental components in DL systems over the last decade. However, bugs in DL frameworks could lead to catastrophic consequences in critical scenarios. A simple yet effective way to find bugs in DL frameworks is fuzz testing (Fuzzing). Existing approaches focus on test generation, leaving execution results with high semantic value (e.g., coverage information, bug reports, and exception logs) in the wild, which can serve as multiple types of feedback. To fill this gap, we propose FUEL to effectively utilize the feedback information, which comprises two Large Language Models (LLMs): analysis LLM and generation LLM. Specifically, analysis LLM infers analysis summaries from feedback information, while the generation LLM creates tests guided by these summaries. Furthermore, based on multiple feedback guidance, we design two additional components: (i) a feedback-aware simulated annealing algorithm to select operators for test generation, enriching test diversity. (ii) a program self-repair strategy to automatically repair invalid tests, enhancing test validity. We evaluate FUEL on the two most popular DL frameworks, and experiment results show that FUEL can improve line code coverage of PyTorch and TensorFlow by 9.15% and 14.70% over state-of-the-art baselines (e.g., TitanFuzz and WhiteFox). By the time of submission, FUEL has detected 104 previously unknown bugs for PyTorch and TensorFlow, with 93 confirmed as new bugs, 49 already fixed, and 14 assigned CVE IDs.

Although prior work has focused on conformity bias, we extend the analysis to examine how LLMs form trust from previous impressions, resist misinformation, and integrate peer input during interaction, key factors for achieving collective intelligence under complex social dynamics. We present KAIROS, a benchmark simulating quiz contests with peer agents of varying reliability, offering fine-grained control over conditions such as expert-novice roles, noisy crowds, and adversarial peers. LLMs receive both historical interactions and current peer responses, allowing systematic investigation into how trust, peer action, and self-confidence influence decisions. As for mitigation strategies, we evaluate prompting, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning, Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO), across multiple models. Our results reveal that GRPO with multi-agent context combined with outcome-based rewards and unconstrained reasoning achieves the best overall performance, but also decreases the robustness to social influence compared to Base models.

      Long-range tasks demand reasoning over long inputs.

Though in-context approaches overcome many of these issues, methods with short-context LLMs are inefficient, trading context for processing more tokens. We introduce PRISM, a highly token-efficient in-context method based on structured schemas that outperforms baselines on diverse tasks with 4x shorter contexts. This approach produces concise outputs and efficiently leverages key-value (KV) caches to reduce costs by up to 54%. PRISM scales down to tiny contexts without increasing costs or sacrificing quality, and generalizes to new tasks with minimal effort by generating schemas from task descriptions.

This highlights the critical need for developing LLMs that can effectively engage in logically consistent multi-turn dialogue, seek information and reason with incomplete data. To this end, we introduce a novel benchmark comprising a suite of multi-turn tasks each designed to test specific reasoning, interactive dialogue, and information-seeking abilities. These tasks have deterministic scoring mechanisms, thus eliminating the need for human intervention. Evaluating frontier models on our benchmark reveals significant headroom. Our analysis shows that most errors emerge from poor instruction following, reasoning failures, and poor planning.

      Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest in applying them to Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tasks, particularly Register Transfer Level (RTL) code generation. While several RTL datasets have been introduced, most focus on syntactic validity rather than functional validation with tests, leading to training examples that compile but may not implement the intended behavior. We present VERICODER, a model for RTL code generation fine-tuned on a dataset validated for functional correctness. This fine-tuning dataset is constructed using a novel methodology that combines unit test generation with feedback-directed refinement. Given a natural language specification and an initial RTL design, we prompt a teacher model (GPT-4o-mini) to generate unit tests and iteratively revise the RTL design based on its simulation results using the generated tests. If necessary, the teacher model also updates the tests to ensure they comply with the natural language specification. As a result of this process, every example in our dataset is functionally validated, consisting of a natural language description, an RTL implementation, and passing tests. Fine-tuned on this dataset of 125,777 examples, VERICODER achieves state-of-the-art metrics in functional correctness on VerilogEval and RTLLM, with relative gains of up to 71.7% and 27.4%, respectively. An ablation study further shows that models trained on our functionally validated dataset outperform those trained on functionally non-validated datasets, underscoring the importance of high-quality datasets in RTL code generation.

      The rapid deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) highlights the need for efficient low-bit post-training quantization (PTQ), due to their high memory costs. A key challenge in weight quantization is the presence of outliers, which inflate quantization ranges and lead to large errors. While a number of outlier suppression techniques have been proposed, they either: fail to effectively shrink the quantization range, or incur (relatively) high bit overhead. In this paper, we present ICQuant, a novel framework that leverages outlier statistics to design an efficient index coding scheme for outlier-aware weight-only quantization. Compared to existing outlier suppression techniques requiring $\approx 1$ bit overhead to halve the quantization range, ICQuant requires only $\approx 0.3$ bits; a significant saving in extreme compression regimes (e.g., 2-3 bits per weight). ICQuant can be used on top of any existing quantizers to eliminate outliers, improving the quantization quality. Using just 2.3 bits per weight and simple scalar quantizers, ICQuant improves the zero-shot accuracy of the 2-bit Llama3-70B model by up to 130% and 150% relative to QTIP and QuIP#; and it achieves comparable performance to the best-known fine-tuned quantizer (PV-tuning) without fine-tuning.

      Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have recently shown impressive capabilities in complex reasoning and tool use via multi-step interactions with their environments. While these agents have the potential to tackle complicated tasks, their problem-solving process, i.e., agents' interaction trajectory leading to task completion, remains underexploited. These trajectories contain rich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving problems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they ignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of search spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that enables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach revisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations: revision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables two critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by intelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories, and (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance performance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through these mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that incrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench Verified to resolve real-world GitHub issues. Experimental results across five strong LLMs show that integrating SE-Agent delivers up to 55% relative improvement, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all open-source agents on SWE-bench Verified.

      As the demand for more personalized recommendation grows and a dramatic boom in commercial scenarios arises, the study on multi-scenario recommendation (MSR) has attracted much attention, which uses the data from all scenarios to simultaneously improve their recommendation performance. However, existing methods tend to integrate insufficient scenario knowledge and neglect learning personalized cross-scenario preferences, thus leading to sub-optimal performance. Meanwhile, though large language model (LLM) has shown great capability of reasoning and capturing semantic information, the high inference latency and high computation cost of tuning hinder its implementation in industrial recommender systems. To fill these gaps, we propose an LLM-enhanced paradigm LLM4MSR in this work. Specifically, we first leverage LLM to uncover multi-level knowledge from the designed scenario- and user-level prompt without fine-tuning the LLM, then adopt hierarchical meta networks to generate multi-level meta layers to explicitly improve the scenario-aware and personalized recommendation capability. Our experiments on KuaiSAR-small, KuaiSAR, and Amazon datasets validate significant advantages of LLM4MSR: (i) the effectiveness and compatibility with different multi-scenario backbone models, (ii) high efficiency and deployability on industrial recommender systems, and (iii) improved interpretability.

Our framework comprises an LVLM-driven instruction parser and scene understanding module, a multi-level LLM-driven editing planner for goal decomposition, tool selection, and sequence generation, an iterative image editing module, and a crucial LVLM-driven feedback and evaluation loop. To rigorously evaluate RefineEdit-Agent, we propose LongBench-T2I-Edit, a new benchmark featuring 500 initial images with complex, multi-turn editing instructions across nine visual dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RefineEdit-Agent significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average score of 3.67 on LongBench-T2I-Edit, compared to 2.29 for Direct Re-Prompting, 2.91 for InstructPix2Pix, 3.16 for GLIGEN-based Edit, and 3.39 for ControlNet-XL. Ablation studies, human evaluations, and analyses of iterative refinement, backbone choices, tool usage, and robustness to instruction complexity further validate the efficacy of our agentic design in delivering superior edit fidelity and context preservation.

      Claim normalization is an integral part of any automatic fact-check verification system. It parses the typically noisy claim data, such as social media posts into normalized claims, which are then fed into downstream veracity classification tasks. The CheckThat! 2025 Task 2 focuses specifically on claim normalization and spans 20 languages under monolingual and zero-shot conditions. Our proposed solution consists of a lightweight \emph{retrieval-first, LLM-backed} pipeline, in which we either dynamically prompt a GPT-4o-mini with in-context examples, or retrieve the closest normalization from the train dataset directly. On the official test set, the system ranks near the top for most monolingual tracks, achieving first place in 7 out of of the 13 languages. In contrast, the system underperforms in the zero-shot setting, highlighting the limitation of the proposed solution.

      Generalizing to unseen graph tasks without task-pecific supervision remains challenging. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are limited by fixed label spaces, while Large Language Models (LLMs) lack structural inductive biases. Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) provide a zero-shot alternative via explicit, long chain-of-thought reasoning. Inspired by this, we propose a GNN-free approach that reformulates graph tasks--node classification, link prediction, and graph classification--as textual reasoning problems solved by LRMs. We introduce the first datasets with detailed reasoning traces for these tasks and develop Graph-R1, a reinforcement learning framework that leverages task-specific rethink templates to guide reasoning over linearized graphs. Experiments demonstrate that Graph-R1 outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in zero-shot settings, producing interpretable and effective predictions. Our work highlights the promise of explicit reasoning for graph learning and provides new resources for future research.
