      Accurate assessment of neuromuscular reflexes, such as the H-reflex, plays a critical role in sports science, rehabilitation, and clinical neurology. Traditional analysis of H-reflex EMG waveforms is subject to variability and interpretation bias among clinicians and researchers, limiting reliability and standardization. To address these challenges, we propose a Fine-Tuned Vision-Language Model (VLM) Consortium and a reasoning Large-Language Model (LLM)-enabled Decision Support System for automated H-reflex waveform interpretation and diagnosis. Our approach leverages multiple VLMs, each fine-tuned on curated datasets of H-reflex EMG waveform images annotated with clinical observations, recovery timelines, and athlete metadata. These models are capable of extracting key electrophysiological features and predicting neuromuscular states, including fatigue, injury, and recovery, directly from EMG images and contextual metadata. Diagnostic outputs from the VLM consortium are aggregated using a consensus-based method and refined by a specialized reasoning LLM, which ensures robust, transparent, and explainable decision support for clinicians and sports scientists. The end-to-end platform orchestrates seamless communication between the VLM ensemble and the reasoning LLM, integrating prompt engineering strategies and automated reasoning workflows using LLM Agents. Experimental results demonstrate that this hybrid system delivers highly accurate, consistent, and interpretable H-reflex assessments, significantly advancing the automation and standardization of neuromuscular diagnostics. To our knowledge, this work represents the first integration of a fine-tuned VLM consortium with a reasoning LLM for image-based H-reflex analysis, laying the foundation for next-generation AI-assisted neuromuscular assessment and athlete monitoring platforms.

      With the increasing popularity of large language models (LLMs) for a variety of tasks, there has been a growing interest in strategies that can predict which out of a set of LLMs will yield a successful answer at low cost. This problem promises to become more and more relevant as providers like Microsoft allow users to easily create custom LLM "assistants" specialized to particular types of queries. However, some tasks (i.e., queries) may be too specialized and difficult for a single LLM to handle alone. These applications often benefit from breaking down the task into smaller subtasks, each of which can then be executed by a LLM expected to perform well on that specific subtask. For example, in extracting a diagnosis from medical records, one can first select an LLM to summarize the record, select another to validate the summary, and then select another, possibly different, LLM to extract the diagnosis from the summarized record. Unlike existing LLM selection or routing algorithms, this setting requires that we select a sequence of LLMs, with the output of each LLM feeding into the next and potentially influencing its success. Thus, unlike single LLM selection, the quality of each subtask's output directly affects the inputs, and hence the cost and success rate, of downstream LLMs, creating complex performance dependencies that must be learned and accounted for during selection. We propose a neural contextual bandit-based algorithm that trains neural networks that model LLM success on each subtask in an online manner, thus learning to guide the LLM selections for the different subtasks, even in the absence of historical LLM performance data. Experiments on telecommunications question answering and medical diagnosis prediction datasets illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach compared to other LLM selection algorithms.

      We propose a novel Two-Stage framework for Structured Pruning (\textsc{2SSP}) for pruning Large Language Models (LLMs), which combines two different strategies of pruning, namely Width and Depth Pruning. The first stage (Width Pruning) removes entire neurons, hence their corresponding rows and columns, aiming to preserve the connectivity among the pruned structures in the intermediate state of the Feed-Forward Networks in each Transformer block. This is done based on an importance score measuring the impact of each neuron on the output magnitude. The second stage (Depth Pruning), instead, removes entire Attention submodules. This is done by applying an iterative process that removes the Attention with the minimum impact on a given metric of interest (in our case, perplexity). We also propose a novel mechanism to balance the sparsity rate of the two stages w.r.t. to the desired global sparsity. We test \textsc{2SSP} on four LLM families and three sparsity rates (25\%, 37.5\%, and 50\%), measuring the resulting perplexity over three language modeling datasets as well as the performance over six downstream tasks. Our method consistently outperforms five state-of-the-art competitors over three language modeling and six downstream tasks, with an up to two-order-of-magnitude gain in terms of pruning time.

      Grading project reports are increasingly significant in today's educational landscape, where they serve as key assessments of students' comprehensive problem-solving abilities. However, it remains challenging due to the multifaceted evaluation criteria involved, such as creativity and peer-comparative achievement. Meanwhile, instructors often struggle to maintain fairness throughout the time-consuming grading process. Recent advances in AI, particularly large language models, have demonstrated potential for automating simpler grading tasks, such as assessing quizzes or basic writing quality. However, these tools often fall short when it comes to complex metrics, like design innovation and the practical application of knowledge, that require an instructor's educational insights into the class situation. To address this challenge, we conducted a formative study with six instructors and developed CoGrader, which introduces a novel grading workflow combining human-LLM collaborative metrics design, benchmarking, and AI-assisted feedback. CoGrader was found effective in improving grading efficiency and consistency while providing reliable peer-comparative feedback to students. We also discuss design insights and ethical considerations for the development of human-AI collaborative grading systems.

      Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) affect approximately five million older adults in the U.S., yet over half remain undiagnosed. Speech-based natural language processing (NLP) offers a promising, scalable approach to detect early cognitive decline through linguistic markers. To develop and evaluate a screening pipeline that (i) fuses transformer embeddings with handcrafted linguistic features, (ii) tests data augmentation using synthetic speech generated by large language models (LLMs), and (iii) benchmarks unimodal and multimodal LLM classifiers for ADRD detection. Transcripts from the DementiaBank "cookie-theft" task (n = 237) were used. Ten transformer models were evaluated under three fine-tuning strategies. A fusion model combined embeddings from the top-performing transformer with 110 lexical-derived linguistic features. Five LLMs (LLaMA-8B/70B, MedAlpaca-7B, Ministral-8B, GPT-4o) were fine-tuned to generate label-conditioned synthetic speech, which was used to augment training data. Three multimodal models (GPT-4o, Qwen-Omni, Phi-4) were tested for speech-text classification in zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. The fusion model achieved F1 = 83.3 (AUC = 89.5), outperforming linguistic or transformer-only baselines. Augmenting training data with 2x MedAlpaca-7B synthetic speech increased F1 to 85.7. Fine-tuning significantly improved unimodal LLM classifiers (e.g., MedAlpaca: F1 = 47.3 -> 78.5 F1). Current multimodal models demonstrated lower performance (GPT-4o = 70.2 F1; Qwen = 66.0). Performance gains aligned with the distributional similarity between synthetic and real speech. Integrating transformer embeddings with linguistic features enhances ADRD detection from speech. Clinically tuned LLMs effectively support both classification and data augmentation, while further advancement is needed in multimodal modeling.

      Jailbreaking techniques trick Large Language Models (LLMs) into producing restricted output, posing a potential threat. One line of defense is to use another LLM as a Judge to evaluate the harmfulness of generated text. However, we reveal that these Judge LLMs are vulnerable to token segmentation bias, an issue that arises when delimiters alter the tokenization process, splitting words into smaller sub-tokens. This alters the embeddings of the entire sequence, reducing detection accuracy and allowing harmful content to be misclassified as safe. In this paper, we introduce Emoji Attack, a novel strategy that amplifies existing jailbreak prompts by exploiting token segmentation bias. Our method leverages in-context learning to systematically insert emojis into text before it is evaluated by a Judge LLM, inducing embedding distortions that significantly lower the likelihood of detecting unsafe content. Unlike traditional delimiters, emojis also introduce semantic ambiguity, making them particularly effective in this attack. Through experiments on state-of-the-art Judge LLMs, we demonstrate that Emoji Attack substantially reduces the unsafe prediction rate, bypassing existing safeguards.

      The growing integration of LLMs into applications has introduced new security risks, notably known as Promptware - maliciously engineered prompts designed to manipulate LLMs to compromise the CIA triad of these applications. While prior research warned about a potential shift in the threat landscape for LLM-powered applications, the risk posed by Promptware is frequently perceived as low. In this paper, we investigate the risk Promptware poses to users of Gemini-powered assistants (web application, mobile application, and Google Assistant). We propose a novel Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment (TARA) framework to assess Promptware risks for end users. Our analysis focuses on a new variant of Promptware called Targeted Promptware Attacks, which leverage indirect prompt injection via common user interactions such as emails, calendar invitations, and shared documents. We demonstrate 14 attack scenarios applied against Gemini-powered assistants across five identified threat classes: Short-term Context Poisoning, Permanent Memory Poisoning, Tool Misuse, Automatic Agent Invocation, and Automatic App Invocation. These attacks highlight both digital and physical consequences, including spamming, phishing, disinformation campaigns, data exfiltration, unapproved user video streaming, and control of home automation devices. We reveal Promptware's potential for on-device lateral movement, escaping the boundaries of the LLM-powered application, to trigger malicious actions using a device's applications. Our TARA reveals that 73% of the analyzed threats pose High-Critical risk to end users. We discuss mitigations and reassess the risk (in response to deployed mitigations) and show that the risk could be reduced significantly to Very Low-Medium. We disclosed our findings to Google, which deployed dedicated mitigations.

      Despite advances in the field of privacy-preserving Natural Language Processing (NLP), a significant challenge remains the accurate evaluation of privacy. As a potential solution, using LLMs as a privacy evaluator presents a promising approach $\unicode{x2013}$ a strategy inspired by its success in other subfields of NLP. In particular, the so-called $\textit{LLM-as-a-Judge}$ paradigm has achieved impressive results on a variety of natural language evaluation tasks, demonstrating high agreement rates with human annotators. Recognizing that privacy is both subjective and difficult to define, we investigate whether LLM-as-a-Judge can also be leveraged to evaluate the privacy sensitivity of textual data. Furthermore, we measure how closely LLM evaluations align with human perceptions of privacy in text. Resulting from a study involving 10 datasets, 13 LLMs, and 677 human survey participants, we confirm that privacy is indeed a difficult concept to measure empirically, exhibited by generally low inter-human agreement rates. Nevertheless, we find that LLMs can accurately model a global human privacy perspective, and through an analysis of human and LLM reasoning patterns, we discuss the merits and limitations of LLM-as-a-Judge for privacy evaluation in textual data. Our findings pave the way for exploring the feasibility of LLMs as privacy evaluators, addressing a core challenge in solving pressing privacy issues with innovative technical solutions.

      WebShell attacks, where malicious scripts are injected into web servers, pose a significant cybersecurity threat. Traditional ML and DL methods are often hampered by challenges such as the need for extensive training data, catastrophic forgetting, and poor generalization. Recently, Large Language Models have emerged as powerful alternatives for code-related tasks, but their potential in WebShell detection remains underexplored. In this paper, we make two contributions: (1) a comprehensive evaluation of seven LLMs, including GPT-4, LLaMA 3.1 70B, and Qwen 2.5 variants, benchmarked against traditional sequence- and graph-based methods using a dataset of 26.59K PHP scripts, and (2) the Behavioral Function-Aware Detection (BFAD) framework, designed to address the specific challenges of applying LLMs to this domain. Our framework integrates three components: a Critical Function Filter that isolates malicious PHP function calls, a Context-Aware Code Extraction strategy that captures the most behaviorally indicative code segments, and Weighted Behavioral Function Profiling that enhances in-context learning by prioritizing the most relevant demonstrations based on discriminative function-level profiles. Our results show that, stemming from their distinct analytical strategies, larger LLMs achieve near-perfect precision but lower recall, while smaller models exhibit the opposite trade-off. However, all baseline models lag behind previous SOTA methods. With the application of BFAD, the performance of all LLMs improves significantly, yielding an average F1 score increase of 13.82%. Notably, larger models now outperform SOTA benchmarks, while smaller models such as Qwen-2.5-Coder-3B achieve performance competitive with traditional methods. This work is the first to explore the feasibility and limitations of LLMs for WebShell detection and provides solutions to address the challenges in this task.

      Evaluating large language models (LLMs) has become increasingly challenging as model capabilities advance rapidly. While recent models often achieve higher scores on standard benchmarks, these improvements do not consistently reflect enhanced real-world reasoning capabilities. Moreover, widespread overfitting to public benchmarks and the high computational cost of full evaluations have made it both expensive and less effective to distinguish meaningful differences between models. To address these challenges, we propose the \textbf{S}tructured \textbf{T}ransition \textbf{E}valuation \textbf{M}ethod (STEM), a lightweight and interpretable evaluation framework for efficiently estimating the relative capabilities of LLMs. STEM identifies \textit{significant transition samples} (STS) by analyzing consistent performance transitions among LLMs of the same architecture but varying parameter scales. These samples enable STEM to effectively estimate the capability position of an unknown model. Qwen3 model family is applied to construct the STS pool on six diverse and representative benchmarks. To assess generalizability. Experimental results indicate that STEM reliably captures performance trends, aligns with ground-truth rankings of model capability. These findings highlight STEM as a practical and scalable method for fine-grained, architecture-agnostic evaluation of LLMs.

      In large language model (LLM) adaptation, balancing multiple optimization objectives such as improving factuality (heat) and increasing confidence (via low entropy) poses a fundamental challenge, especially when prompt parameters (e.g., hidden-layer insertions h and embedding modifications w) interact in non-trivial ways. Existing multi-objective optimization strategies often rely on scalar gradient aggregation, ignoring the deeper geometric structure between objectives and parameters. We propose J6, a structured Jacobian-based method that decomposes the gradient interaction matrix into six interpretable components. This decomposition enables both hard decision-making (e.g., choosing the dominant update direction via argmax) and soft strategies (e.g., attention-style weighting via softmax over J6), forming a dynamic update framework that adapts to local conflict and synergy. Moreover, the interpretable structure of J6 provides insight into parameter attribution, task interference, and geometry-aligned adaptation. Our work introduces a principled and extensible mechanism for conflict-aware prompt optimization, and opens a new avenue for incorporating structured Jacobian reasoning into multi-objective neural tuning.

      Despite extensive safety-tuning, large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks via adversarially crafted instructions, reflecting a persistent trade-off between safety and task performance. In this work, we propose Intent-FT, a simple and lightweight fine-tuning approach that explicitly trains LLMs to infer the underlying intent of an instruction before responding. By fine-tuning on a targeted set of adversarial instructions, Intent-FT enables LLMs to generalize intent deduction to unseen attacks, thereby substantially improving their robustness. We comprehensively evaluate both parametric and non-parametric attacks across open-source and proprietary models, considering harmfulness from attacks, utility, over-refusal, and impact against white-box threats. Empirically, Intent-FT consistently mitigates all evaluated attack categories, with no single attack exceeding a 50\% success rate -- whereas existing defenses remain only partially effective. Importantly, our method preserves the model's general capabilities and reduces excessive refusals on benign instructions containing superficially harmful keywords. Furthermore, models trained with Intent-FT accurately identify hidden harmful intent in adversarial attacks, and these learned intentions can be effectively transferred to enhance vanilla model defenses.

      The rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in unmanned systems has significantly enhanced the semantic understanding and autonomous task execution capabilities of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms. However, limited communication bandwidth and the need for high-frequency interactions pose severe challenges to semantic information transmission within the swarm. This paper explores the feasibility of LLM-driven UAV swarms for autonomous semantic compression communication, aiming to reduce communication load while preserving critical task semantics. To this end, we construct four types of 2D simulation scenarios with different levels of environmental complexity and design a communication-execution pipeline that integrates system prompts with task instruction prompts. On this basis, we systematically evaluate the semantic compression performance of nine mainstream LLMs in different scenarios and analyze their adaptability and stability through ablation studies on environmental complexity and swarm size. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-based UAV swarms have the potential to achieve efficient collaborative communication under bandwidth-constrained and multi-hop link conditions.

      While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse tasks, they fundamentally lack self-awareness and frequently exhibit overconfidence, assigning high confidence scores to incorrect predictions. Accurate confidence estimation is therefore critical for enhancing the trustworthiness and reliability of LLM-generated outputs. However, existing approaches suffer from coarse-grained scoring mechanisms that fail to provide fine-grained, continuous confidence estimates throughout the generation process. To address these limitations, we introduce FineCE, a novel confidence estimation method that delivers accurate, fine-grained confidence scores during text generation. Specifically, we first develop a comprehensive pipeline for constructing training data that effectively captures the underlying probabilistic distribution of LLM responses, and then train a model to predict confidence scores for arbitrary text sequences in a supervised manner. Furthermore, we propose a Backward Confidence Integration (BCI) strategy that leverages information from the subsequent text to enhance confidence estimation for the current sequence during inference. We also introduce three strategies for identifying optimal positions to perform confidence estimation within the generation process. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that FineCE consistently outperforms existing classical confidence estimation methods. Our code and all baselines used in the paper are available on GitHub.

      Continual Relation Extraction (CRE) aims to continually learn new emerging relations while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Existing CRE methods mainly use memory replay and contrastive learning to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. However, these methods do not attach importance to the error cases that can reveal the model's cognitive biases more effectively. To address this issue, we propose an instruction-based continual contrastive tuning approach for Large Language Models (LLMs) in CRE. Different from existing CRE methods that typically handle the training and memory data in a unified manner, this approach splits the training and memory data of each task into two parts respectively based on the correctness of the initial responses and treats them differently through dual-task fine-tuning. In addition, leveraging the advantages of LLM's instruction-following ability, we propose a novel instruction-based contrastive tuning strategy for LLM to continuously correct current cognitive biases with the guidance of previous data in an instruction-tuning manner, which mitigates the gap between old and new relations in a more suitable way for LLMs. We experimentally evaluate our model on TACRED and FewRel, and the results show that our model achieves new state-of-the-art CRE performance with significant improvements, demonstrating the importance of specializing in exploiting error cases.

      Attention mechanisms are central to the success of large language models (LLMs), enabling them to capture intricate token dependencies and implicitly assign importance to each token. Recent studies have revealed the sink token, which receives disproportionately high attention despite their limited semantic role. In this paper, we first expand the relationship between the sink token and other tokens, moving beyond attention to explore their similarity in hidden states, considering the layer depth. We observe that as the layers get deeper, the cosine similarity between the normalized hidden states of the sink token and those of other tokens increases, and that the normalized hidden states of the sink token exhibit negligible changes. These imply that other tokens consistently are directed toward the sink token throughout the layers. Next, we propose a dynamic token selection method, called OrthoRank, using these findings to select important tokens. Specifically, in a certain layer, we define token importance by the speed at which the token moves toward the sink token. This is converted into orthogonality with the sink token, meaning that tokens that are more orthogonal to the sink token are assigned greater importance. Finally, through extensive experiments, we demonstrated that our method results in lower perplexity and higher zero-shot accuracy compared to layer pruning methods at the same sparsity ratio with comparable throughput, while also achieving superior performance on LongBench.

      Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Unlike traditional RL approaches, RLVR leverages rule-based feedback to guide LLMs in generating and refining complex reasoning chains -- a process critically dependent on effective exploration strategies. While prior work has demonstrated RLVR's empirical success, the fundamental mechanisms governing LLMs' exploration behaviors remain underexplored. This technical report presents a systematic investigation of exploration capacities in RLVR, covering four main aspects: (1) exploration space shaping, where we develop quantitative metrics to characterize LLMs' capability boundaries; (2) entropy-performance exchange, analyzed across training stages, individual instances, and token-level patterns; and (3) RL performance optimization, examining methods to effectively translate exploration gains into measurable improvements. By unifying previously identified insights with new empirical evidence, this work aims to provide a foundational framework for advancing RLVR systems.

      Future prediction is a complex task for LLM agents, requiring a high level of analytical thinking, information gathering, contextual understanding, and decision-making under uncertainty. Agents must not only gather and interpret vast amounts of dynamic information but also integrate diverse data sources, weigh uncertainties, and adapt predictions based on emerging trends, just as human experts do in fields like politics, economics, and finance. Despite its importance, no large-scale benchmark exists for evaluating agents on future prediction, largely due to challenges in handling real-time updates and retrieving timely, accurate answers. To address this, we introduce $\textbf{FutureX}$, a dynamic and live evaluation benchmark specifically designed for LLM agents performing future prediction tasks. FutureX is the largest and most diverse live benchmark for future prediction, supporting real-time daily updates and eliminating data contamination through an automated pipeline for question gathering and answer collection. We evaluate 25 LLM/agent models, including those with reasoning, search capabilities, and integration of external tools such as the open-source Deep Research Agent and closed-source Deep Research models. This comprehensive evaluation assesses agents' adaptive reasoning and performance in dynamic environments. Additionally, we provide in-depth analyses of agents' failure modes and performance pitfalls in future-oriented tasks, including the vulnerability to fake web pages and the temporal validity. Our goal is to establish a dynamic, contamination-free evaluation standard that drives the development of LLM agents capable of performing at the level of professional human analysts in complex reasoning and predictive thinking.

      The Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in code-related tasks. However, most research focuses on improving the output quality of LLMs (e.g., correctness), and less attention has been paid to the LLM input (e.g., the training code quality). Given that code smells are widely existed in practice and can negatively impact software maintainability and readability, this study takes the first systematic research to assess and improve dataset quality in terms of code smells. In this work, we first conduct a preliminary study to explore the presence of code smells in a popular benchmark dataset (i.e., CodeSearchNet-Python}) and evaluate the output of several popular LLMs (i.e., DeepSeek-Coder, CodeLlama, and MagiCoder), revealing that code smell issues extensively exist in LLM's input (e.g., benchmark dataset) and output (e.g., generated code). We then conduct our systematic research by taking three main steps: Firstly, we propose an LLM-based code smell cleaning tool, named SmellCC, which automatically refactors and removes code smells. To evaluate the correctness of the code refactoring, we construct a test set of 50 repositories sourced from the CodeSearchNet-Python benchmark for functional testing. Then we apply our curated smell-cleaned dataset to fine-tune two LLMs (i.e., DeepSeek-V2 and Qwen-Coder) to explore their potential for generating high-quality code. Thirdly, we investigate the impact of code smells on two downstream tasks: code completion and code search. Lastly, we derive several actionable implications for software engineering researchers and industry practitioners from our findings.

      Game-playing ability serves as an indicator for evaluating the strategic reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs). While most existing studies rely on utility performance metrics, which are not robust enough due to variations in opponent behavior and game structure. To address this limitation, we propose \textbf{Cognitive Hierarchy Benchmark (CHBench)}, a novel evaluation framework inspired by the cognitive hierarchy models from behavioral economics. We hypothesize that agents have bounded rationality -- different agents behave at varying reasoning depths/levels. We evaluate LLMs' strategic reasoning through a three-phase systematic framework, utilizing behavioral data from six state-of-the-art LLMs across fifteen carefully selected normal-form games. Experiments show that LLMs exhibit consistent strategic reasoning levels across diverse opponents, confirming the framework's robustness and generalization capability. We also analyze the effects of two key mechanisms (Chat Mechanism and Memory Mechanism) on strategic reasoning performance. Results indicate that the Chat Mechanism significantly degrades strategic reasoning, whereas the Memory Mechanism enhances it. These insights position CHBench as a promising tool for evaluating LLM capabilities, with significant potential for future research and practical applications.

      Unlike English, which uses distinct forms (e.g., had, has, will have) to mark the perfect aspect across tenses, Chinese and Japanese lack separate grammatical forms for tense within the perfect aspect, which complicates Natural Language Inference (NLI). Focusing on the perfect aspect in these languages, we construct a linguistically motivated, template-based NLI dataset (1,350 pairs per language). Experiments reveal that even advanced LLMs struggle with temporal inference, particularly in detecting subtle tense and reference-time shifts. These findings highlight model limitations and underscore the need for cross-linguistic evaluation in temporal semantics. Our dataset is available at https://github.com/Lujie2001/CrossNLI.

      Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) integrates quantization into the training loop, enabling LLMs to learn robust low-bit representations, and is widely recognized as one of the most promising research directions. All current QAT research focuses on minimizing quantization error on full-precision models, where the full-precision accuracy acts as an upper bound (accuracy ceiling). No existing method has even attempted to surpass this ceiling. To break this ceiling, we propose a new paradigm: raising the ceiling (full-precision model), and then still quantizing it efficiently into 2 bits. We propose Fairy$\pm i$, the first 2-bit quantization framework for complex-valued LLMs. Specifically, our method leverages the representational advantages of the complex domain to boost full-precision accuracy. We map weights to the fourth roots of unity $\{\pm1, \pm i\}$, forming a perfectly symmetric and information-theoretically optimal 2-bit representation. Importantly, each quantized weight has either a zero real or imaginary part, enabling multiplication-free inference using only additions and element swaps. Experimental results show that Fairy$\pm i$ outperforms the ceiling of existing 2-bit quantization approaches in terms of both PPL and downstream tasks, while maintaining strict storage and compute efficiency. This work opens a new direction for building highly accurate and practical LLMs under extremely low-bit constraints.

      Game-theoretic interactions between agents with Large Language Models (LLMs) have revealed many emergent capabilities, yet the linguistic diversity of these interactions has not been sufficiently quantified. In this paper, we present the Conversational Robustness Evaluation Score: CORE, a metric to quantify the effectiveness of language use within multi-agent systems across different game-theoretic interactions. CORE integrates measures of cluster entropy, lexical repetition, and semantic similarity, providing a direct lens of dialog quality. We apply CORE to pairwise LLM dialogs across competitive, cooperative, and neutral settings, further grounding our analysis in Zipf's and Heaps' Laws to characterize word frequency distributions and vocabulary growth. Our findings show that cooperative settings exhibit both steeper Zipf distributions and higher Heap exponents, indicating more repetition alongside greater vocabulary expansion. In contrast, competitive interactions display lower Zipf and Heaps exponents, reflecting less repetition and more constrained vocabularies. These results provide new insights into how social incentives influence language adaptation, and highlight CORE as a robust diagnostic for measuring linguistic robustness in multi-agent LLM systems.

However, effective navigation and situational awareness depend on users' prior knowledge of the environment, limiting the usefulness of these systems for exploring unfamiliar places. We explore how integrating location-aware LLM-based narrative capabilities into a mobile robot can support remote exploration. We developed a prototype system, called NarraGuide, that provides narrative guidance for users to explore and learn about a remote place through a dialogue-based interface. We deployed our prototype in a geology museum, where remote participants (n=20) used the robot to tour the museum. Our findings reveal how users perceived the robot's role, engaged in dialogue in the tour, and expressed preferences for bystander encountering.

However, their robustness under prompt injection attacks, where malicious instructions are embedded into the content to manipulate outputs, remains a significant concern. In this work, we explore a frustratingly simple yet effective attack setting to test whether LLMs can be easily misled. Specifically, we evaluate LLMs on basic arithmetic questions (e.g., "What is 3 + 2?") presented as either multiple-choice or true-false judgment problems within PDF files, where hidden prompts are injected into the file. Our results reveal that LLMs are indeed vulnerable to such hidden prompt injection attacks, even in these trivial scenarios, highlighting serious robustness risks for LLM-as-a-judge applications.

This system comprises: a unified platform compatible with diverse agent frameworks and LLMs; multidimensional metrics assessing cognitive program synthesis, collaboration, execution efficiency, bioinformatics knowledge integration, and task completion quality; and 50 diverse real-world single-cell omics analysis tasks spanning multi-omics, species, and sequencing technologies. Our evaluation reveals that Grok-3-beta achieves state-of-the-art performance among tested agent frameworks. Multi-agent frameworks significantly enhance collaboration and execution efficiency over single-agent approaches through specialized role division. Attribution analyses of agent capabilities identify that high-quality code generation is crucial for task success, and self-reflection has the most significant overall impact, followed by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and planning.

      Logging code is written by developers to capture system runtime behavior and plays a vital role in debugging, performance analysis, and system monitoring. However, defects in logging code can undermine the usefulness of logs and lead to misinterpretations. Although prior work has identified several logging defect patterns and provided valuable insights into logging practices, these studies often focus on a narrow range of defect patterns derived from limited sources (e.g., commit histories) and lack a systematic and comprehensive analysis. Moreover, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising generalization and reasoning capabilities across a variety of code-related tasks, yet their potential for detecting logging code defects remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we derive a comprehensive taxonomy of logging code defects, which encompasses seven logging code defect patterns with 14 detailed scenarios. We further construct a benchmark dataset, \dataset, consisting of 164 developer-verified real-world logging defects. Then we propose an automated framework that leverages various prompting strategies and contextual information to evaluate LLMs' capability in detecting and reasoning logging code defects. Experimental results reveal that LLMs generally struggle to accurately detect and reason logging code defects based on the source code only. However, incorporating proper knowledge (e.g., detailed scenarios of defect patterns) can lead to 10.9\% improvement in detection accuracy. Overall, our findings provide actionable guidance for practitioners to avoid common defect patterns and establish a foundation for improving LLM-based reasoning in logging code defect detection.

In this work, we propose a new form of querier-aware LLM personalization, generating different responses even for the same query from different queriers. We design a dual-tower model architecture with a cross-querier general encoder and a querier-specific encoder. We further apply contrastive learning with multi-view augmentation, pulling close the dialogue representations of the same querier, while pulling apart those of different queriers. To mitigate the impact of query diversity on querier-contrastive learning, we cluster the dialogues based on query similarity and restrict the scope of contrastive learning within each cluster. To address the lack of datasets designed for querier-aware personalization, we also build a multi-querier dataset from English and Chinese scripts, as well as WeChat records, called MQDialog, containing 173 queriers and 12 responders. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our design significantly improves the quality of personalized response generation, achieving relative improvement of 8.4% to 48.7% in ROUGE-L scores and winning rates ranging from 54% to 82% compared with various baseline methods.

      The integration of wireless communications and Large Language Models (LLMs) is poised to unlock ubiquitous intelligent services, yet deploying them in wireless edge-device collaborative environments presents a critical trade-off between inference quality and end-to-end latency. A fundamental mismatch exists between task complexity and resource allocation: offloading simple queries invites prohibitive latency, while on-device models lack the capacity for demanding computations. To address this challenge, we propose a dynamic, quality-latency aware routing framework that orchestrates inference between a lightweight model on the mobile device and a powerful model on the edge server. Our framework employs two distinct cost models: for single-turn queries, it fuses a BERT-predicted semantic score with communication and computation overheads; for multi-turn dialogues, it further quantifies context-aware costs arising from model switching and KV-cache management. While maintaining full inference quality, extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework cuts average response latency by 5-15% and reduces large model invocations by 10-20% against competitive baselines on MMLU, GSM8K, and MT-Bench-101 benchmarks.

      LLMs increasingly exhibit over-refusal behavior, where safety mechanisms cause models to reject benign instructions that superficially resemble harmful content. This phenomena diminishes utility in production applications that repeatedly rely on common prompt templates or applications that frequently rely on LLMs for specific tasks (e.g. sentiment analysis, language translation). Through comprehensive evaluation, we demonstrate that LLMs still tend to refuse responses to harmful instructions when those instructions are reframed to appear as benign tasks. Our mechanistic analysis reveal that LLMs follow distinct "constellation" patterns in embedding space as representations traverse layers, with each task maintaining consistent trajectories that shift predictably between refusal and non-refusal cases. We introduce SafeConstellations, an inference-time trajectory-shifting approach that tracks task-specific trajectory patterns and guides representations toward non-refusal pathways. By selectively guiding model behavior only on tasks prone to over-refusal, and by preserving general model behavior, our method reduces over-refusal rates by up to 73% with minimal impact on utility-offering a principled approach to mitigating over-refusals.

In this paper, we introduce a benchmarking tool named ELIB (edge LLM inference benchmarking) to evaluate LLM inference performance of different edge platforms, and propose a novel metric named MBU to indicate the percentage of the theoretically efficient use of available memory bandwidth for a specific model running on edge hardware to optimize memory usage. We deploy ELIB on three edge platforms and benchmark using five quantized models to optimize MBU in combination with other metrics such as FLOPS, throughput, latency and accuracy. And we analyze the results to derive the key factors, constraints, unpredictability in optimizing MBU that can guide deploying LLMs on more edge platforms.

      Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in reasoning tasks, but their performance on linguistics puzzles remains consistently poor. These puzzles, often derived from Linguistics Olympiad (LO) contests, provide a minimal contamination environment to assess LLMs' linguistic reasoning abilities across low-resource languages. This work analyses LLMs' performance on 629 problems across 41 low-resource languages by labelling each with linguistically informed features to unveil weaknesses. Our analyses show that LLMs struggle with puzzles involving higher morphological complexity and perform better on puzzles involving linguistic features that are also found in English. We also show that splitting words into morphemes as a pre-processing step improves solvability, indicating a need for more informed and language-specific tokenisers. These findings thus offer insights into some challenges in linguistic reasoning and modelling of low-resource languages.

      Instruction fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) enable a simple zero-shot or few-shot prompting paradigm, also known as in-context learning, for building prediction models. This convenience, combined with continued advances in LLM capability, has the potential to drive their adoption across a broad range of domains, including high-stakes applications where group fairness -- preventing disparate impacts across demographic groups -- is essential. The majority of existing approaches to enforcing group fairness on LLM-based classifiers rely on traditional fair algorithms applied via model fine-tuning or head-tuning on final-layer embeddings, but they are no longer applicable to closed-weight LLMs under the in-context learning setting, which include some of the most capable commercial models today, such as GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude. In this paper, we propose a framework for deriving fair classifiers from closed-weight LLMs via prompting: the LLM is treated as a feature extractor, and features are elicited from its probabilistic predictions (e.g., token log probabilities) using prompts strategically designed for the specified fairness criterion to obtain sufficient statistics for fair classification; a fair algorithm is then applied to these features to train a lightweight fair classifier in a post-hoc manner. Experiments on five datasets, including three tabular ones, demonstrate strong accuracy-fairness tradeoffs for the classifiers derived by our framework from both open-weight and closed-weight LLMs; in particular, our framework is data-efficient and outperforms fair classifiers trained on LLM embeddings (i.e., head-tuning) or from scratch on raw tabular features.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in automating code generation tasks offering new opportunities across software engineering domains. However, their practical application remains limited due to hallucinations - outputs that appear plausible but are factually incorrect, unverifiable or nonsensical. This paper investigates hallucination phenomena in the context of code generation with a specific focus on the automotive domain. A case study is presented that evaluates multiple code LLMs for three different prompting complexities ranging from a minimal one-liner prompt to a prompt with Covesa Vehicle Signal Specifications (VSS) as additional context and finally to a prompt with an additional code skeleton. The evaluation reveals a high frequency of syntax violations, invalid reference errors and API knowledge conflicts in state-of-the-art models GPT-4.1, Codex and GPT-4o. Among the evaluated models, only GPT-4.1 and GPT-4o were able to produce a correct solution when given the most context-rich prompt. Simpler prompting strategies failed to yield a working result, even after multiple refinement iterations. These findings highlight the need for effective mitigation techniques to ensure the safe and reliable use of LLM generated code, especially in safety-critical domains such as automotive software systems.

      There is a growing interest in utilizing large-scale language models (LLMs) to advance next-generation Recommender Systems (RecSys), driven by their outstanding language understanding and in-context learning capabilities. In this scenario, tokenizing (i.e., indexing) users and items becomes essential for ensuring a seamless alignment of LLMs with recommendations. While several studies have made progress in representing users and items through textual contents or latent representations, challenges remain in efficiently capturing high-order collaborative knowledge into discrete tokens that are compatible with LLMs. Additionally, the majority of existing tokenization approaches often face difficulties in generalizing effectively to new/unseen users or items that were not in the training corpus. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called TokenRec, which introduces not only an effective ID tokenization strategy but also an efficient retrieval paradigm for LLM-based recommendations. Specifically, our tokenization strategy, Masked Vector-Quantized (MQ) Tokenizer, involves quantizing the masked user/item representations learned from collaborative filtering into discrete tokens, thus achieving a smooth incorporation of high-order collaborative knowledge and a generalizable tokenization of users and items for LLM-based RecSys. Meanwhile, our generative retrieval paradigm is designed to efficiently recommend top-$K$ items for users to eliminate the need for the time-consuming auto-regressive decoding and beam search processes used by LLMs, thus significantly reducing inference time. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, demonstrating that TokenRec outperforms competitive benchmarks, including both traditional recommender systems and emerging LLM-based recommender systems.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly exhibit over-refusal - erroneously rejecting benign queries due to overly conservative safety measures - a critical functional flaw that undermines their reliability and usability. Current methods for testing this behavior are demonstrably inadequate, suffering from flawed benchmarks and limited test generation capabilities, as highlighted by our empirical user study. To the best of our knowledge, this paper introduces the first evolutionary testing framework, ORFuzz, for the systematic detection and analysis of LLM over-refusals. ORFuzz uniquely integrates three core components: (1) safety category-aware seed selection for comprehensive test coverage, (2) adaptive mutator optimization using reasoning LLMs to generate effective test cases, and (3) OR-Judge, a human-aligned judge model validated to accurately reflect user perception of toxicity and refusal. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that ORFuzz generates diverse, validated over-refusal instances at a rate (6.98% average) more than double that of leading baselines, effectively uncovering vulnerabilities. Furthermore, ORFuzz's outputs form the basis of ORFuzzSet, a new benchmark of 1,855 highly transferable test cases that achieves a superior 63.56% average over-refusal rate across 10 diverse LLMs, significantly outperforming existing datasets. ORFuzz and ORFuzzSet provide a robust automated testing framework and a valuable community resource, paving the way for developing more reliable and trustworthy LLM-based software systems.

      Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) extend LLMs to handle images, videos, and audio by incorporating feature extractors and projection modules. However, these additional components -- combined with complex inference pipelines and heterogeneous workloads -- introduce significant inference overhead. Therefore, efficiently serving MLLMs remains a major challenge. Current tightly coupled serving architectures struggle to distinguish between mixed request types or adapt parallelism strategies to different inference stages, leading to increased time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency and poor resource utilization. To address this, we introduce Elastic Multimodal Parallelism (EMP), a new serving paradigm that elastically adapts to resource heterogeneity across request types and inference stages. Building upon EMP, we develop ElasticMM, an MLLM serving system that (1) separates requests into independent modality groups with dynamic resource allocation via a modality-aware load balancer; (2) decouples inference stages and enables parallelism adjustment and adaptive scaling via elastic partition scheduling; and (3) improves inference efficiency through unified multimodal prefix caching and non-blocking encoding. Experiments on diverse real-world datasets show that ElasticMM outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) serving systems, reducing TTFT by up to 4.2x and achieving 3.2-4.5x higher throughput while meeting service-level objectives (SLOs).

      Recent advances in video-based multimodal large language models (Video-LLMs) have significantly improved video understanding by processing videos as sequences of image frames. However, many existing methods treat frames independently in the vision backbone, lacking explicit temporal modeling, which limits their ability to capture dynamic patterns and efficiently handle long videos. To address these limitations, we introduce STORM (Spatiotemporal TOken Reduction for Multimodal LLMs), a novel architecture incorporating a dedicated temporal encoder between the image encoder and the LLM. Our temporal encoder leverages the Mamba State Space Model to integrate temporal information into image tokens, generating enriched representations that preserve inter-frame dynamics across the entire video sequence. This enriched encoding not only enhances video reasoning capabilities but also enables effective token reduction strategies, including test-time sampling and training-based temporal and spatial pooling, substantially reducing computational demands on the LLM without sacrificing key temporal information. By integrating these techniques, our approach simultaneously reduces training and inference latency while improving performance, enabling efficient and robust video understanding over extended temporal contexts. Extensive evaluations show that STORM achieves state-of-the-art results across various long video understanding benchmarks (more than 5% improvement on MLVU and LongVideoBench) while reducing the computation costs by up to $8\times$ and the decoding latency by 2.4-2.9$\times$ for the fixed numbers of input frames.

For sentence-level simplification, our methodology employs large language models (LLMs) to first generate a structured plan, followed by plan-driven simplification of individual sentences. At the document level, we leverage LLMs to produce concise summaries and subsequently guide the simplification process using these summaries. This two-stage, LLM-based framework enables more coherent and contextually faithful simplifications of scientific text.

      How much large language models (LLMs) can aid scientific discovery, notably in assisting academic peer review, is in heated debate. Between a literature digest and a human-comparable research assistant lies their practical application potential. We organize individual tasks that computer science studies employ in separate terms into a guided and robust workflow to evaluate LLMs' processing of academic text input. We employ four tasks in the assessment: content reproduction/comparison/scoring/reflection, each demanding a specific role of the LLM (oracle/judgmental arbiter/knowledgeable arbiter/collaborator) in assisting scholarly works, and altogether testing LLMs with questions that increasingly require intellectual capabilities towards a solid understanding of scientific texts to yield desirable solutions. We exemplify a rigorous performance evaluation with detailed instructions on the prompts. Adopting first-rate Information Systems articles at three top journals as the input texts and an abundant set of text metrics, we record a compromised performance of the leading LLM - Google's Gemini: its summary and paraphrase of academic text is acceptably reliable; using it to rank texts through pairwise text comparison is faintly scalable; asking it to grade academic texts is prone to poor discrimination; its qualitative reflection on the text is self-consistent yet hardly insightful to inspire meaningful research. This evidence against an endorsement of LLMs' text-processing capabilities is consistent across metric-based internal (linguistic assessment), external (comparing to the ground truth), and human evaluation, and is robust to the variations of the prompt. Overall, we do not recommend an unchecked use of LLMs in constructing peer reviews.

      As one of the key tools in many security tasks, decompilers reconstruct human-readable source code from binaries. Yet, despite recent advances, their outputs often suffer from syntactic and semantic errors and remain difficult to read. Recently, with the advent of large language models (LLMs), researchers began to explore the potential of LLMs to refine decompiler output. Nevertheless, our study of these approaches reveals their problems, such as introducing new errors and relying on unreliable accuracy validation. In this paper, we present D-LIFT, an enhanced decompiler-LLM pipeline with a fine-tuned LLM using code quality-aware reinforcement learning. Unlike prior work that overlooks preserving accuracy, D-LIFT adheres to a key principle for enhancing the quality of decompiled code: preserving accuracy while improving readability. Central to D-LIFT, we propose D-Score, an integrated code quality assessment system to score the decompiled source code from multiple aspects, and use it to guide reinforcement learning fine-tuning and to select the best output during inference. In line with our principle, D-Score assigns low scores to any inaccurate output and only awards higher scores for readability to code that passes the accuracy check. Our implementation, based on Ghidra and a range of LLMs, demonstrates significant improvements for the accurate decompiled code from the coreutils and util-linux projects. Compared to baseline LLMs without D-Score-driven fine-tuning, our trained LLMs produce 55.3% more improved decompiled functions, as measured by D-Score. Overall, D-LIFT improves the quality of 68.2% of all the functions produced by the native decompiler.

      LLM-based multi-agent systems exhibit strong collaborative capabilities but often suffer from redundant communication and excessive token overhead. Existing methods typically enhance efficiency through pretrained GNNs or greedy algorithms, but often isolate pre- and post-task optimization, lacking a unified strategy. To this end, we present SafeSieve, a progressive and adaptive multi-agent pruning algorithm that dynamically refines the inter-agent communication through a novel dual-mechanism. SafeSieve integrates initial LLM-based semantic evaluation with accumulated performance feedback, enabling a smooth transition from heuristic initialization to experience-driven refinement. Unlike existing greedy Top-k pruning methods, SafeSieve employs 0-extension clustering to preserve structurally coherent agent groups while eliminating ineffective links. Experiments across benchmarks (SVAMP, HumanEval, etc.) showcase that SafeSieve achieves 94.01% average accuracy while reducing token usage by 12.4%-27.8%. Results further demonstrate robustness under prompt injection attacks (1.23% average accuracy drop). In heterogeneous settings, SafeSieve reduces deployment costs by 13.3% while maintaining performance. These results establish SafeSieve as a robust, efficient, and scalable framework for practical multi-agent systems. Our code can be found in https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SafeSieve-D8F2FFUN.

      This paper introduces a novel approach for multimodal sentiment analysis on social media, particularly in the context of natural disasters, where understanding public sentiment is crucial for effective crisis management. Unlike conventional methods that process text and image modalities separately, our approach seamlessly integrates Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based image analysis with Large Language Model (LLM) based text processing, leveraging Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) and prompt engineering to extract sentiment relevant features from the CrisisMMD dataset. To effectively model intermodal relationships, we introduce a contextual attention mechanism within the fusion process. Leveraging contextual-attention layers, this mechanism effectively captures intermodality interactions, enhancing the model's comprehension of complex relationships between textual and visual data. The deep neural network architecture of our model learns from these fused features, leading to improved accuracy compared to existing baselines. Experimental results demonstrate significant advancements in classifying social media data into informative and noninformative categories across various natural disasters. Our model achieves a notable 2.43% increase in accuracy and 5.18% in F1-score, highlighting its efficacy in processing complex multimodal data. Beyond quantitative metrics, our approach provides deeper insight into the sentiments expressed during crises. The practical implications extend to real time disaster management, where enhanced sentiment analysis can optimize the accuracy of emergency interventions. By bridging the gap between multimodal analysis, LLM powered text understanding, and disaster response, our work presents a promising direction for Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven crisis management solutions.

      The rise of large language models (LLMs) has introduced new privacy challenges, particularly during inference where sensitive information in prompts may be exposed to proprietary LLM APIs. In this paper, we address the problem of formally protecting the sensitive information contained in a prompt while maintaining response quality. To this end, first, we introduce a cryptographically inspired notion of a prompt sanitizer which transforms an input prompt to protect its sensitive tokens. Second, we propose Pr$\epsilon\epsilon$mpt, a novel system that implements a prompt sanitizer. Pr$\epsilon\epsilon$mpt categorizes sensitive tokens into two types: (1) those where the LLM's response depends solely on the format (such as SSNs, credit card numbers), for which we use format-preserving encryption (FPE); and (2) those where the response depends on specific values, (such as age, salary) for which we apply metric differential privacy (mDP). Our evaluation demonstrates that Pr$\epsilon\epsilon$mpt is a practical method to achieve meaningful privacy guarantees, while maintaining high utility compared to unsanitized prompts, and outperforming prior methods

      Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a cornerstone of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) due to its simplicity and efficiency. However, existing DPO-based approaches typically treat all preference pairs uniformly, ignoring critical variations in their inherent quality and learning utility, leading to suboptimal data utilization and performance. To address this challenge, we propose Omni-DPO, a dual-perspective optimization framework that jointly accounts for (1) the inherent quality of each preference pair and (2) the model's evolving performance on those pairs. By adaptively weighting samples according to both data quality and the model's learning dynamics during training, Omni-DPO enables more effective training data utilization and achieves better performance. Experimental results on various models and benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and generalization capabilities of Omni-DPO. On textual understanding tasks, Gemma-2-9b-it finetuned with Omni-DPO beats the leading LLM, Claude 3 Opus, by a significant margin of 6.7 points on the Arena-Hard benchmark. On mathematical reasoning tasks, Omni-DPO consistently outperforms the baseline methods across all benchmarks, providing strong empirical evidence for the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.

      Automatic code translation is a fundamental task in modern software development. While the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly improved the correctness of code translation, the critical dimension of execution efficiency remains overlooked. To address this gap, we introduce TRACY, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the execution efficiency of LLM-translated code. TRACY is constructed through an LLM-driven two-stage pipeline: an initial stage generates a suite of stress tests to amplify performance differences, followed by an efficiency-oriented task pruning stage that isolates the efficiency-distinguishing tasks. The resulting benchmark comprises 1,011 code translation tasks across C++, Java, and Python, each accompanied by an average of 22.1 verified reference translations and 10 computationally demanding tests. Our extensive evaluation of 26 representative LLMs reveals that even top-tier LLMs struggle to consistently produce efficient code translations. For instance, Claude-4-think, the leading model for correctness, ranks eighth overall when time efficiency is taken into account, surpassed by several smaller open-source models. We further pinpoint that algorithmic flaws and improper resource handling are the most detrimental, causing a median time slowdown of 5.6$\times$ and memory increase of 12.0$\times$, respectively. Our work underscores the necessity of jointly optimizing for correctness and efficiency in future LLM-based code translation.

      Large language models (LLMs) are now widely used across many fields, including marketing research. Sentiment analysis, in particular, helps firms understand consumer preferences. While most NLP studies classify sentiment from review text alone, marketing theories, such as prospect theory and expectation--disconfirmation theory, point out that customer evaluations are shaped not only by the actual experience but also by additional reference points. This study therefore investigates how the content and format of such supplementary information affect sentiment analysis using LLMs. We compare natural language (NL) and JSON-formatted prompts using a lightweight 3B parameter model suitable for practical marketing applications. Experiments on two Yelp categories (Restaurant and Nightlife) show that the JSON prompt with additional information outperforms all baselines without fine-tuning: Macro-F1 rises by 1.6% and 4% while RMSE falls by 16% and 9.1%, respectively, making it deployable in resource-constrained edge devices. Furthermore, a follow-up analysis confirms that performance gains stem from genuine contextual reasoning rather than label proxying. This work demonstrates that structured prompting can enable smaller models to achieve competitive performance, offering a practical alternative to large-scale model deployment.

      Autonomous agents in safety-critical applications must continuously adapt to dynamic conditions without compromising performance and reliability. This work introduces TAPA (Training-free Adaptation of Programmatic Agents), a novel framework that positions large language models (LLMs) as intelligent moderators of the symbolic action space. Unlike prior programmatic agents that typically generate a monolithic policy program or rely on fixed symbolic action sets, TAPA synthesizes and adapts modular programs for individual high-level actions, referred to as logical primitives. By decoupling strategic intent from execution, TAPA enables meta-agents to operate over an abstract, interpretable action space while the LLM dynamically generates, composes, and refines symbolic programs tailored to each primitive. Extensive experiments across cybersecurity and swarm intelligence domains validate TAPA's effectiveness. In autonomous DDoS defense scenarios, TAPA achieves 77.7% network uptime while maintaining near-perfect detection accuracy in unknown dynamic environments. In swarm intelligence formation control under environmental and adversarial disturbances, TAPA consistently preserves consensus at runtime where baseline methods fail completely. This work promotes a paradigm shift for autonomous system design in evolving environments, from policy adaptation to dynamic action adaptation.

      Recent advances in mathematical reasoning and the long-term planning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have precipitated the development of agents, which are being increasingly leveraged in business operations processes. Decision models to optimize inventory levels are one of the core elements of operations management. However, the capabilities of the LLM agent in making inventory decisions in uncertain contexts, as well as the decision-making biases (e.g. framing effect, etc.) of the agent, remain largely unexplored. This prompts concerns regarding the capacity of LLM agents to effectively address real-world problems, as well as the potential implications of biases that may be present. To address this gap, we introduce AIM-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to assess the decision-making behaviour of LLM agents in uncertain supply chain management scenarios through a diverse series of inventory replenishment experiments. Our results reveal that different LLMs typically exhibit varying degrees of decision bias that are similar to those observed in human beings. In addition, we explored strategies to mitigate the pull-to-centre effect and the bullwhip effect, namely cognitive reflection and implementation of information sharing. These findings underscore the need for careful consideration of the potential biases in deploying LLMs in Inventory decision-making scenarios. We hope that these insights will pave the way for mitigating human decision bias and developing human-centred decision support systems for supply chains.

      Large language models implicitly encode preferences over human values, yet steering them often requires large training data. In this work, we investigate a simple approach: Can we reliably modify a model's value system in downstream behavior by training it to answer value survey questions accordingly? We first construct value profiles of several open-source LLMs by asking them to rate a series of value-related descriptions spanning 20 distinct human values, which we use as a baseline for subsequent experiments. We then investigate whether the value system of a model can be governed by fine-tuning on the value surveys. We evaluate the effect of finetuning on the model's behavior in two ways; first, we assess how answers change on in-domain, held-out survey questions. Second, we evaluate whether the model's behavior changes in out-of-domain settings (situational scenarios). To this end, we construct a contextualized moral judgment dataset based on Reddit posts and evaluate changes in the model's behavior in text-based adventure games. We demonstrate that our simple approach can not only change the model's answers to in-domain survey questions, but also produces substantial shifts (value alignment) in implicit downstream task behavior.

      The increasing heterogeneity of student populations poses significant challenges for teachers, particularly in mathematics education, where cognitive, motivational, and emotional differences strongly influence learning outcomes. While AI-driven personalization tools have emerged, most remain performance-focused, offering limited support for teachers and neglecting broader pedagogical needs. This paper presents the FACET framework, a teacher-facing, large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent system designed to generate individualized classroom materials that integrate both cognitive and motivational dimensions of learner profiles. The framework comprises three specialized agents: (1) learner agents that simulate diverse profiles incorporating topic proficiency and intrinsic motivation, (2) a teacher agent that adapts instructional content according to didactical principles, and (3) an evaluator agent that provides automated quality assurance. We tested the system using authentic grade 8 mathematics curriculum content and evaluated its feasibility through a) automated agent-based assessment of output quality and b) exploratory feedback from K-12 in-service teachers. Results from ten internal evaluations highlighted high stability and alignment between generated materials and learner profiles, and teacher feedback particularly highlighted structure and suitability of tasks. The findings demonstrate the potential of multi-agent LLM architectures to provide scalable, context-aware personalization in heterogeneous classroom settings, and outline directions for extending the framework to richer learner profiles and real-world classroom trials.

      LLM-based agents have emerged as transformative tools capable of executing complex tasks through iterative planning and action, achieving significant advancements in understanding and addressing user needs. Yet, their effectiveness remains limited in specialized domains such as mental health diagnosis, where they underperform compared to general applications. Current approaches to integrating diagnostic capabilities into LLMs rely on scarce, highly sensitive mental health datasets, which are challenging to acquire. These methods also fail to emulate clinicians' proactive inquiry skills, lack multi-turn conversational comprehension, and struggle to align outputs with expert clinical reasoning. To address these gaps, we propose DSM5AgentFlow, the first LLM-based agent workflow designed to autonomously generate DSM-5 Level-1 diagnostic questionnaires.

      The rise of LLMs poses new possibilities in modeling opinion evolution, a long-standing task in simulation, by leveraging advanced reasoning abilities to recreate complex, large-scale human cognitive trends. While most prior works focus on opinion evolution surrounding specific isolated events or the views within a country, ours is the first to model the large-scale attitude evolution of a population representing an entire country towards another -- US citizens' perspectives towards China. To tackle the challenges of this broad scenario, we propose a framework that integrates media data collection, user profile creation, and cognitive architecture for opinion updates to successfully reproduce the real trend of US attitudes towards China over a 20-year period from 2005 to today. We also leverage LLMs' capabilities to introduce debiased media exposure, extracting neutral events from typically subjective news contents, to uncover the roots of polarized opinion formation, as well as a devils advocate agent to help explain the rare reversal from negative to positive attitudes towards China, corresponding with changes in the way Americans obtain information about the country. The simulation results, beyond validating our framework architecture, also reveal the impact of biased framing and selection bias in shaping attitudes. Overall, our work contributes to a new paradigm for LLM-based modeling of cognitive behaviors in a large-scale, long-term, cross-border social context, providing insights into the formation of international biases and offering valuable implications for media consumers to better understand the factors shaping their perspectives, and ultimately contributing to the larger social need for bias reduction and cross-cultural tolerance.

      Formal logic enables computers to reason in natural language by representing sentences in symbolic forms and applying rules to derive conclusions. However, in what our study characterizes as "rulebreaker" scenarios, this method can lead to conclusions that are typically not inferred or accepted by humans given their common sense and factual knowledge. Inspired by works in cognitive science, we create RULEBREAKERS, the first dataset for rigorously evaluating the ability of large language models (LLMs) to recognize and respond to rulebreakers (versus non-rulebreakers) in a human-like manner. Evaluating seven LLMs, we find that most models, including GPT-4o, achieve mediocre accuracy on RULEBREAKERS and exhibit some tendency to over-rigidly apply logical rules unlike what is expected from typical human reasoners. Further analysis suggests that this apparent failure is potentially associated with the models' poor utilization of their world knowledge and their attention distribution patterns. Whilst revealing a limitation of current LLMs, our study also provides a timely counterbalance to a growing body of recent works that propose methods relying on formal logic to improve LLMs' general reasoning capabilities, highlighting their risk of further increasing divergence between LLMs and human-like reasoning.

      The proliferation of high-quality text from Large Language Models (LLMs) demands reliable and efficient detection methods. While existing training-free approaches show promise, they often rely on surface-level statistics and overlook fundamental signal properties of the text generation process. In this work, we reframe detection as a signal processing problem, introducing a novel paradigm that analyzes the sequence of token log-probabilities in the frequency domain. By systematically analyzing the signal's spectral properties using the global Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and the local Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), we find that human-written text consistently exhibits significantly higher spectral energy. This higher energy reflects the larger-amplitude fluctuations inherent in human writing compared to the suppressed dynamics of LLM-generated text. Based on this key insight, we construct SpecDetect, a detector built on a single, robust feature from the global DFT: DFT total energy. We also propose an enhanced version, SpecDetect++, which incorporates a sampling discrepancy mechanism to further boost robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art model while running in nearly half the time. Our work introduces a new, efficient, and interpretable pathway for LLM-generated text detection, showing that classical signal processing techniques offer a surprisingly powerful solution to this modern challenge.

      Quantization is an essential and popular technique for improving the accessibility of large language models (LLMs) by reducing memory usage and computational costs while maintaining performance. In this study, we apply 4-bit Group Scaling Quantization (GSQ) and Generative Pretrained Transformer Quantization (GPTQ) to LLaMA 1B, Qwen 0.5B, and PHI 1.5B, evaluating their impact across multiple NLP tasks. We benchmark these models on MS MARCO (Information Retrieval), BoolQ (Boolean Question Answering), and GSM8K (Mathematical Reasoning) datasets, assessing both accuracy and efficiency across various tasks. The study measures the trade-offs between model compression and task performance, analyzing key evaluation metrics, namely accuracy, inference latency, and throughput (total output tokens generated per second), providing insights into the suitability of low-bit quantization for real-world deployment. Using the results, users can then make suitable decisions based on the specifications that need to be met. We discuss the pros and cons of GSQ and GPTQ techniques on models of different sizes, which also serve as a benchmark for future experiments.

      Homelessness is a persistent social challenge, impacting millions worldwide. Over 770,000 people experienced homelessness in the U.S. in 2024. Social stigmatization is a significant barrier to alleviation, shifting public perception, and influencing policymaking. Given that online and city council discourse reflect and influence part of public opinion, it provides valuable insights to identify and track social biases. This research contributes to alleviating homelessness by acting on public opinion. It introduces novel methods, building on natural language processing (NLP) and large language models (LLMs), to identify and measure PEH social bias expressed in digital spaces. We present a new, manually-annotated multi-modal dataset compiled from Reddit, X (formerly Twitter), news articles, and city council meeting minutes across 10 U.S. cities. This unique dataset provides evidence of the typologies of homelessness bias described in the literature. In order to scale up and automate the detection of homelessness bias online, we evaluate LLMs as classifiers. We applied both zero-shot and few-shot classification techniques to this data. We utilized local LLMs (Llama 3.2 3B Instruct, Qwen 2.5 7B Instruct, and Phi4 Instruct Mini) as well as closed-source API models (GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Grok-4). Our findings reveal that although there are significant inconsistencies in local LLM zero-shot classification, the in-context learning classification scores of local LLMs approach the classification scores of closed-source LLMs. Furthermore, LLMs outperform BERT when averaging across all categories. This work aims to raise awareness about the pervasive bias against PEH, develop new indicators to inform policy, and ultimately enhance the fairness and ethical application of Generative AI technologies.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the state-of-the-art in various coding tasks. Beyond directly answering user queries, LLMs can also serve as judges, assessing and comparing the quality of responses generated by other models. Such an evaluation capability is crucial both for benchmarking different LLMs and for improving response quality through response ranking. However, despite the growing adoption of the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm, its effectiveness in coding scenarios remains underexplored due to the absence of dedicated benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce CodeJudgeBench, a benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate the performance of LLM-as-a-Judge models across three critical coding tasks: code generation, code repair, and unit test generation. Through comprehensive benchmarking of 26 LLM-as-a-Judge models, we find that recent thinking models significantly outperform non-thinking models on our carefully designed code judging tasks. Notably, even relatively small thinking models, such as Qwen3-8B, can outperform specially trained LLM-as-a-Judge models up to 70B in size. Nevertheless, all models still exhibit significant randomness in their judgment of coding tasks. For pairwise judging tasks, simply changing the order in which responses are presented can substantially impact accuracy. In addition, when judging code and unit tests written by different LLMs, LLM-as-a-Judge models also show variance in performance. This sensitivity raises concerns about the reliability and consistency of LLM-as-a-Judge in coding scenarios. Lastly, we study optimal prompting strategies for LLM-as-a-Judge. We find that using pair-wise comparison outperforms scalar point-wise judging. Furthermore, retaining comments and reasoning in the full, unprocessed LLM response leads to improved judge performance.

      Understanding biases and stereotypes encoded in the weights of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies. Biased behaviour is often subtle and non-trivial to isolate, even when deliberately elicited, making systematic analysis and debiasing particularly challenging. To address this, we introduce BiasGym, a simple, cost-effective, and generalizable framework for reliably injecting, analyzing, and mitigating conceptual associations within LLMs. BiasGym consists of two components: BiasInject, which injects specific biases into the model via token-based fine-tuning while keeping the model frozen, and BiasScope, which leverages these injected signals to identify and steer the components responsible for biased behavior. Our method enables consistent bias elicitation for mechanistic analysis, supports targeted debiasing without degrading performance on downstream tasks, and generalizes to biases unseen during token-based fine-tuning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of BiasGym in reducing real-world stereotypes (e.g., people from Italy being `reckless drivers') and in probing fictional associations (e.g., people from a fictional country having `blue skin'), showing its utility for both safety interventions and interpretability research.

      The widespread deployment of LLM-based agents is likely to introduce a critical privacy threat: malicious agents that proactively engage others in multi-turn interactions to extract sensitive information. These dynamic dialogues enable adaptive attack strategies that can cause severe privacy violations, yet their evolving nature makes it difficult to anticipate and discover sophisticated vulnerabilities manually. To tackle this problem, we present a search-based framework that alternates between improving attacker and defender instructions by simulating privacy-critical agent interactions. Each simulation involves three roles: data subject, data sender, and data recipient. While the data subject's behavior is fixed, the attacker (data recipient) attempts to extract sensitive information from the defender (data sender) through persistent and interactive exchanges. To explore this interaction space efficiently, our search algorithm employs LLMs as optimizers, using parallel search with multiple threads and cross-thread propagation to analyze simulation trajectories and iteratively propose new instructions. Through this process, we find that attack strategies escalate from simple direct requests to sophisticated multi-turn tactics such as impersonation and consent forgery, while defenses advance from rule-based constraints to identity-verification state machines. The discovered attacks and defenses transfer across diverse scenarios and backbone models, demonstrating strong practical utility for building privacy-aware agents.

      Amidst a shortage of qualified mental health professionals, the integration of large language models (LLMs) into psychological applications offers a promising way to alleviate the growing burden of mental health disorders. Recent reasoning-augmented LLMs have achieved remarkable performance in mathematics and programming, while research in the psychological domain has predominantly emphasized emotional support and empathetic dialogue, with limited attention to reasoning mechanisms that are beneficial to generating reliable responses. Therefore, in this paper, we propose Psyche-R1, the first Chinese psychological LLM that jointly integrates empathy, psychological expertise, and reasoning, built upon a novel data curation pipeline. Specifically, we design a comprehensive data synthesis pipeline that produces over 75k high-quality psychological questions paired with detailed rationales, generated through chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and iterative prompt-rationale optimization, along with 73k empathetic dialogues. Subsequently, we employ a hybrid training strategy wherein challenging samples are identified through a multi-LLM cross-selection strategy for group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to improve reasoning ability, while the remaining data is used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance empathetic response generation and psychological domain knowledge. Extensive experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the Psyche-R1 across several psychological benchmarks, where our 7B Psyche-R1 achieves comparable results to 671B DeepSeek-R1.

      Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) integrates quantization into the training loop, enabling LLMs to learn robust low-bit representations, and is widely recognized as one of the most promising research directions. All current QAT research focuses on minimizing quantization error on full-precision models, where the full-precision accuracy acts as an upper bound (accuracy ceiling). No existing method has even attempted to surpass this ceiling. To break this ceiling, we propose a new paradigm: raising the ceiling (full-precision model), and then still quantizing it efficiently into 2 bits. We propose Fairy$\pm i$, the first 2-bit quantization framework for complex-valued LLMs. Specifically, our method leverages the representational advantages of the complex domain to boost full-precision accuracy. We map weights to the fourth roots of unity $\{\pm1, \pm i\}$, forming a perfectly symmetric and information-theoretically optimal 2-bit representation. Importantly, each quantized weight has either a zero real or imaginary part, enabling multiplication-free inference using only additions and element swaps. Experimental results show that Fairy$\pm i$ outperforms the ceiling of existing 2-bit quantization approaches in terms of both PPL and downstream tasks, while maintaining strict storage and compute efficiency. This work opens a new direction for building highly accurate and practical LLMs under extremely low-bit constraints.

      Novelty assessment is a central yet understudied aspect of peer review, particularly in high volume fields like NLP where reviewer capacity is increasingly strained. We present a structured approach for automated novelty evaluation that models expert reviewer behavior through three stages: content extraction from submissions, retrieval and synthesis of related work, and structured comparison for evidence based assessment. Our method is informed by a large scale analysis of human written novelty reviews and captures key patterns such as independent claim verification and contextual reasoning. Evaluated on 182 ICLR 2025 submissions with human annotated reviewer novelty assessments, the approach achieves 86.5% alignment with human reasoning and 75.3% agreement on novelty conclusions - substantially outperforming existing LLM based baselines. The method produces detailed, literature aware analyses and improves consistency over ad hoc reviewer judgments. These results highlight the potential for structured LLM assisted approaches to support more rigorous and transparent peer review without displacing human expertise. Data and code are made available.

      Large language models (LLMs) have been widely deployed with rapidly expanding context windows to support increasingly demanding applications. However, long contexts pose significant deployment challenges, primarily due to the KV cache whose size grows proportionally with context length. While KV cache compression methods are proposed to address this issue, KV dropping methods incur considerable accuracy loss, and KV retrieval methods suffer from significant efficiency bottlenecks. We propose FreeKV, an algorithm-system co-optimization framework to enhance KV retrieval efficiency while preserving accuracy. On the algorithm side, FreeKV introduces speculative retrieval to shift the KV selection and recall processes out of the critical path, combined with fine-grained correction to ensure accuracy. On the system side, FreeKV employs hybrid KV layouts across CPU and GPU memory to eliminate fragmented data transfers, and leverages double-buffered streamed recall to further improve efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that FreeKV achieves near-lossless accuracy across various scenarios and models, delivering up to 13$\times$ speedup compared to SOTA KV retrieval methods.

      Large language models are often assumed to acquire increasingly structured, generalizable internal representations simply by scaling data and parameters. We interrogate this assumption by introducing a Clinical Trial Natural Language Inference benchmark comprising four reasoning families, Causal Attribution, Compositional Grounding, Epistemic Verification, and Risk State Abstraction. Each item is paired with a targeted Ground Knowledge and Meta-Level Reasoning Verification (GKMRV) probe, allowing us to dissociate failures of factual access from failures of inference. We evaluate six contemporary LLMs under both direct and chain of thought prompting. Models achieve near-ceiling GKMRV accuracy (mean accuracy 0.918) yet perform poorly on the main reasoning tasks (mean accuracy 0.25). Despite low accuracy, output inferences are highly consistent across samples (mean 0.87), indicating a systematic application of underlying heuristics and shortcuts. These results reveal fundamental structural and representational limitations: current LLMs often possess the relevant clinical knowledge but lack the structured, composable internal representations needed to deploy it reliably (e.g., integrating constraints, weighing evidence, or simulating counterfactuals). Decoupling knowledge from reasoning with GKMRV makes this dissociation explicit and measurable, providing an effective framework for probing the reliability of LLMs in high-stakes domains.

      The rise of long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) amplifies memory and bandwidth demands during autoregressive decoding, as the Key-Value (KV) cache grows with each generated token. Low-bit KV-cache quantization (e.g., 4-bit or 2-bit) can reduce memory footprint while preserving accuracy, but existing systems suffer from slow decoding due to their exclusive reliance on CUDA cores, neglecting Tensor Cores (the primary source of compute on modern GPUs). We present BitDecoding, a new long-context LLM inference system with a low-bit KV cache. BitDecoding enables efficient low-bit KV-cache decoding by cooperatively leveraging CUDA cores and Tensor Cores. It introduces methods for automatically inducing optimized layouts to exploit Tensor Cores, along with warp-level parallelization strategies for dequantization. For unified system support, BitDecoding includes a query transformation module supporting diverse attention variants, a quantization kernel that supports both tensor-wise and channel-wise scaling used in various quantization algorithms with high performance, and a dequantization kernel with a software-defined pipeline to coordinate CUDA and Tensor Cores execution for mixed-precision operations. Evaluated on RTX 4090, A100, and H100, BitDecoding accelerates decoding by up to 7.5x, 4.8x, and 8.9x, respectively, over FP16 FlashDecoding-v2, and surpasses the state-of-the-art low-bit system QServe by up to 4.3x.

      Recent advancements in post-training Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly through Reinforcement Learning (RL) and preference optimization methods, are key drivers for enhancing their reasoning capabilities. However, these methods are often plagued by low sample efficiency and a susceptibility to primacy bias, where overfitting to initial experiences degrades policy quality and damages the learning process. To address these challenges, we introduce LLM optimization with Reset Replay (LoRR), a general and powerful plugin designed to enhance sample efficiency in any preference-based optimization framework. LoRR core mechanism enables training at a high replay number, maximizing the utility of each collected data batch. To counteract the risk of overfitting inherent in high-replay training, LoRR incorporates a periodic reset strategy with reusing initial data, which preserves network plasticity. Furthermore, it leverages a hybrid optimization objective, combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference-based losses to further bolster data exploitation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LoRR significantly boosts the performance of various preference optimization methods on both mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks. Notably, an iterative DPO approach augmented with LoRR achieves comparable performance on challenging math tasks, outperforming some complex and computationally intensive RL-based algorithms. These findings highlight that LoRR offers a practical, sample-efficient, and highly effective paradigm for LLM finetuning, unlocking greater performance from limited data.

      Effective incident response (IR) is critical for mitigating cyber threats, yet security teams are overwhelmed by alert fatigue, high false-positive rates, and the vast volume of unstructured Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) documents. While CTI holds immense potential for enriching security operations, its extensive and fragmented nature makes manual analysis time-consuming and resource-intensive. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and enhance IR by integrating dynamically retrieved CTI. Our approach introduces a hybrid retrieval mechanism that combines NLP-based similarity searches within a CTI vector database with standardized queries to external CTI platforms, facilitating context-aware enrichment of security alerts.

We propose a dual evaluation paradigm, wherein automated assessment using an auxiliary LLM is systematically cross-validated by cybersecurity experts. Empirical validation on real-world and simulated alerts demonstrates that our approach enhances the accuracy, contextualization, and efficiency of IR, alleviating analyst workload and reducing response latency.

      Solidity, the dominant smart contract language for Ethereum, has rapidly evolved with frequent version updates to enhance security, functionality, and developer experience. However, these continual changes introduce significant challenges, particularly in compilation errors, code migration, and maintenance. Therefore, we conduct an empirical study to investigate the challenges in the Solidity version evolution and reveal that 81.68% of examined contracts encounter errors when compiled across different versions, with 86.92% of compilation errors. To mitigate these challenges, we conducted a systematic evaluation of large language models (LLMs) for resolving Solidity compilation errors during version migrations. Our empirical analysis across both open-source (LLaMA3, DeepSeek) and closed-source (GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo) LLMs reveals that although these models exhibit error repair capabilities, their effectiveness diminishes significantly for semantic-level issues and shows strong dependency on prompt engineering strategies. This underscores the critical need for domain-specific adaptation in developing reliable LLM-based repair systems for smart contracts. Building upon these insights, we introduce SMCFIXER, a novel framework that systematically integrates expert knowledge retrieval with LLM-based repair mechanisms for Solidity compilation error resolution. The architecture comprises three core phases: (1) context-aware code slicing that extracts relevant error information; (2) expert knowledge retrieval from official documentation; and (3) iterative patch generation for Solidity migration. Experimental validation across Solidity version migrations demonstrates our approach's statistically significant 24.24% improvement over baseline GPT-4o on real-world datasets, achieving near-perfect 96.97% accuracy.

We introduce SEQ-GPT, a spatial query system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) towards more versatile SEQ search using natural language. The language capabilities of LLMs enable unique interactive operations in the SEQ process, including asking users to clarify query details and dynamically adjusting the search based on user feedback. We also propose a tailored LLM adaptation pipeline that aligns natural language with structured spatial data and queries through dialogue synthesis and multi-model cooperation. SEQ-GPT offers an end-to-end demonstration for broadening spatial search with realistic data and application scenarios.

      Question answering over Scholarly Knowledge Graphs (SKGs) remains a challenging task due to the complexity of scholarly content and the intricate structure of these graphs. Large Language Model (LLM) approaches could be used to translate natural language questions (NLQs) into SPARQL queries; however, these LLM-based approaches struggle with SPARQL query generation due to limited exposure to SKG-specific content and the underlying schema. We identified two main types of errors in the LLM-generated SPARQL queries: (i) structural inconsistencies, such as missing or redundant triples in the queries, and (ii) semantic inaccuracies, where incorrect entities or properties are shown in the queries despite a correct query structure. To address these issues, we propose FIRESPARQL, a modular framework that supports fine-tuned LLMs as a core component, with optional context provided via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and a SPARQL query correction layer. We evaluate the framework on the SciQA Benchmark using various configurations (zero-shot, zero-shot with RAG, one-shot, fine-tuning, and fine-tuning with RAG) and compare the performance with baseline and state-of-the-art approaches. We measure query accuracy using BLEU and ROUGE metrics, and query result accuracy using relaxed exact match(RelaxedEM), with respect to the gold standards containing the NLQs, SPARQL queries, and the results of the queries. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning achieves the highest overall performance, reaching 0.90 ROUGE-L for query accuracy and 0.85 RelaxedEM for result accuracy on the test set.

      The increasing scale and complexity of large language models (LLMs) pose significant inference latency challenges, primarily due to their autoregressive decoding paradigm characterized by the sequential nature of next-token prediction. By re-examining the outputs of autoregressive models, we observed that some segments exhibit parallelizable structures, which we term intrinsic parallelism. Decoding each parallelizable branch simultaneously (i.e. parallel decoding) can significantly improve the overall inference speed of LLMs. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Serial-Parallel Decoding (ASPD), which addresses two core challenges: automated construction of parallelizable data and efficient parallel decoding mechanism. More specifically, we introduce a non-invasive pipeline that automatically extracts and validates parallelizable structures from the responses of autoregressive models. To empower efficient adaptive serial-parallel decoding, we implement a Hybrid Decoding Engine which enables seamless transitions between serial and parallel decoding modes while maintaining a reusable KV cache, maximizing computational efficiency. Extensive evaluations across General Tasks, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Mathematical Reasoning, demonstrate that ASPD achieves unprecedented performance in both effectiveness and efficiency. Notably, on Vicuna Bench, our method achieves up to 3.19x speedup (1.85x on average) while maintaining response quality within 1% difference compared to autoregressive models, realizing significant acceleration without compromising generation quality. Our framework sets a groundbreaking benchmark for efficient LLM parallel inference, paving the way for its deployment in latency-sensitive applications such as AI-powered customer service bots and answer retrieval engines.

      Open-source software (OSS) has experienced a surge in popularity, attributed to its collaborative development model and cost-effective nature. However, the adoption of specific software versions in development projects may introduce security risks when these versions bring along vulnerabilities. Current methods of identifying vulnerable versions typically analyze and extract the code features involved in vulnerability patches using static analysis with pre-defined rules. They then use code clone detection to identify the vulnerable versions. These methods are hindered by imprecision due to (1) the exclusion of vulnerability-irrelevant code in the analysis and (2) the inadequacy of code clone detection. This paper presents VERCATION, an approach designed to identify vulnerable versions of OSS written in C/C++. VERCATION combines program slicing with a Large Language Model (LLM) to identify vulnerability-relevant code from vulnerability patches. It then backtracks historical commits to gather previous modifications of identified vulnerability-relevant code. We propose code clone detection based on expanded and normalized ASTs to compare the differences between pre-modification and post-modification code, thereby locating the vulnerability-introducing commit (vic) and enabling the identification of the vulnerable versions between the vulnerability-fixing commit and the vic. We curate a dataset linking 122 OSS vulnerabilities and 1,211 versions to evaluate VERCATION. On this dataset, our approach achieves an F1 score of 93.1%, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, VERCATION detected 202 incorrect vulnerable OSS versions in NVD reports.

      Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in complex decision-making is essential for advancing AI's ability for strategic planning and real-time adaptation. However, existing benchmarks for tasks like StarCraft II fail to capture the game's full complexity, such as its complete game context, diverse action spaces, and all playable races. To address this gap, we present SC2Arena, a benchmark that fully supports all playable races, low-level action spaces, and optimizes text-based observations to tackle spatial reasoning challenges. Complementing this, we introduce StarEvolve, a hierarchical framework that integrates strategic planning with tactical execution, featuring iterative self-correction and continuous improvement via fine-tuning on high-quality gameplay data. Its key components include a Planner-Executor-Verifier structure to break down gameplay, and a scoring system for selecting high-quality training samples. Comprehensive analysis using SC2Arena provides valuable insights into developing generalist agents that were not possible with previous benchmarks. Experimental results also demonstrate that our proposed StarEvolve achieves superior performance in strategic planning. Our code, environment, and algorithms are publicly available.

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing tasks, yet their application to graph structure analysis, particularly in community search, remains underexplored. Community search, a fundamental task in graph analysis, aims to identify groups of nodes with dense interconnections, which is crucial for understanding the macroscopic structure of graphs. In this paper, we propose GraphCS, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of LLMs in community search tasks. Our experiments reveal that while LLMs exhibit preliminary potential, they frequently fail to return meaningful results and suffer from output bias. To address these limitations, we introduce CS-Agent, a dual-agent collaborative framework to enhance LLM-based community search. CS-Agent leverages the complementary strengths of two LLMs acting as Solver and Validator. Through iterative feedback and refinement, CS-Agent dynamically refines initial results without fine-tuning or additional training. After the multi-round dialogue, Decider module selects the optimal community. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CS-Agent significantly improves the quality and stability of identified communities compared to baseline methods. To our knowledge, this is the first work to apply LLMs to community search, bridging the gap between LLMs and graph analysis while providing a robust and adaptive solution for real-world applications.

      Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant performance gains via scaling up model sizes and/or data. However, recent evidence suggests diminishing returns from such approaches, motivating scaling the computation spent at inference time. Existing inference-time scaling methods, usually with reward models, cast the task as a search problem, which tends to be vulnerable to reward hacking as a consequence of approximation errors in reward models. In this paper, we instead cast inference-time scaling as a probabilistic inference task and leverage sampling-based techniques to explore the typical set of the state distribution of a state-space model with an approximate likelihood, rather than optimize for its mode directly. We propose a novel inference-time scaling approach by adapting particle-based Monte Carlo methods to this task. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that our methods have a 4-16x better scaling rate over our deterministic search counterparts on various challenging mathematical reasoning tasks. Using our approach, we show that Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B-Instruct can surpass GPT-4o accuracy in only 4 rollouts, while Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct scales to o1 level accuracy in only 32 rollouts. Our work not only presents an effective method to inference-time scaling, but also connects the rich literature in probabilistic inference with inference-time scaling of LLMs to develop more robust algorithms in future work.

      Although LLM inference has emerged as a critical workload for many downstream applications, efficiently inferring LLMs is challenging due to the substantial memory footprint and bandwidth requirements. In parallel, compute capabilities have steadily outpaced both memory capacity and bandwidth over the last few decades, a trend that remains evident in modern GPU hardware and exacerbates the challenge of LLM inference. As such, new algorithms are emerging that trade increased computation for reduced memory operations. To that end, we present XQuant, which takes advantage of this trend, enabling an order-of-magnitude reduction in memory consumption through low-bit quantization with substantial accuracy benefits relative to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods. We accomplish this by quantizing and caching the layer input activations X, instead of using standard KV caching, and then rematerializing the Keys and Values on-the-fly during inference. This results in an immediate 2$\times$ memory savings compared to KV caching. By applying XQuant, we achieve up to $\sim 7.7\times$ memory savings with $<0.1$ perplexity degradation compared to the FP16 baseline. Furthermore, our approach leverages the fact that X values are similar across layers. Building on this observation, we introduce XQuant-CL, which exploits the cross-layer similarity in the X embeddings for extreme compression. Across different models, XQuant-CL attains up to 10$\times$ memory savings relative to the FP16 baseline with only 0.01 perplexity degradation, and 12.5$\times$ memory savings with only $0.1$ perplexity degradation. XQuant exploits the rapidly increasing compute capabilities of hardware platforms to eliminate the memory bottleneck, while surpassing state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods and achieving near-FP16 accuracy across a wide range of models.

      Evaluating jailbreak attacks is challenging when prompts are not overtly harmful or fail to induce harmful outputs. Unfortunately, many existing red-teaming datasets contain such unsuitable prompts. To evaluate attacks accurately, these datasets need to be assessed and cleaned for maliciousness. However, existing malicious content detection methods rely on either manual annotation, which is labor-intensive, or large language models (LLMs), which have inconsistent accuracy in harmful types. To balance accuracy and efficiency, we propose a hybrid evaluation framework named MDH (Malicious content Detection based on LLMs with Human assistance) that combines LLM-based annotation with minimal human oversight, and apply it to dataset cleaning and detection of jailbroken responses. Furthermore, we find that well-crafted developer messages can significantly boost jailbreak success, leading us to propose two new strategies: D-Attack, which leverages context simulation, and DH-CoT, which incorporates hijacked chains of thought.

      Automated vulnerability detection research has made substantial progress, yet its real-world impact remains limited. Current vulnerability datasets suffer from issues including label inaccuracy rates of 20-71%, extensive duplication, and poor coverage of critical CWE types. These issues create a significant "generalization gap" where models achieve misleading self-testing performance (measured on held-out data from the same dataset for training) by exploiting spurious correlations rather than learning true vulnerability patterns. Our analysis reveals that many models experience substantial performance drops of up to 33% when evaluated on independent data, with some performing close to random guessing. To address these limitations, we present a three-part solution. First, we introduce a manually curated test dataset, BenchVul, covering the MITRE Top 25 Most Dangerous CWEs. Second, we construct a high-quality training dataset, TitanVul, comprising 38,863 functions by aggregating seven public sources and applying deduplication and validation using a novel multi-agent LLM framework. Third, we propose a Realistic Vulnerability Generation (RVG) framework, which synthesizes context-aware vulnerability examples for underrepresented but critical CWE types through simulated development workflows. Our evaluation shows the strengths of each component in closing the generalization gap. First, BenchVul shows the limitations of self-testing: models trained on existing datasets, such as BigVul and CVEfixes, experience performance drops on BenchVul (from 0.776 to 0.519 and from 0.713 to 0.607). Second, training models on TitanVul demonstrates improved generalization, with model performance increasing from 0.584 when evaluated on the same dataset to 0.767 when tested on BenchVul. Third, supplementing TitanVul with RVG-generated data yields further gains, increasing model performance by 14.0% to 0.874.

This method broadens the scope of cross-lingual ABSA, enabling it to handle more complex tasks and providing a practical, efficient alternative to translation-dependent techniques.

      Recommender systems in concert with Large Language Models (LLMs) present promising avenues for generating semantically-informed recommendations. However, LLM-based recommenders exhibit a tendency to overemphasize semantic correlations within users' interaction history. When taking pretrained collaborative ID embeddings as input, LLM-based recommenders progressively weaken the inherent collaborative signals as the embeddings propagate through LLM backbones layer by layer, as opposed to traditional Transformer-based sequential models in which collaborative signals are typically preserved or even enhanced for state-of-the-art performance. To address this limitation, we introduce FreLLM4Rec, an approach designed to balance semantic and collaborative information from a spectral perspective. Item embeddings that incorporate both semantic and collaborative information are first purified using a Global Graph Low-Pass Filter (G-LPF) to preliminarily remove irrelevant high-frequency noise. Temporal Frequency Modulation (TFM) then actively preserves collaborative signal layer by layer. Note that the collaborative preservation capability of TFM is theoretically guaranteed by establishing a connection between the optimal but hard-to-implement local graph fourier filters and the suboptimal yet computationally efficient frequency-domain filters. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that FreLLM4Rec successfully mitigates collaborative signal attenuation and achieves competitive performance, with improvements of up to 8.00\% in NDCG@10 over the best baseline. Our findings provide insights into how LLMs process collaborative information and offer a principled approach for improving LLM-based recommendation systems.

      Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a highly efficient approach for downstream tasks, particularly in scenarios with limited computational resources. However, applying LoRA techniques to quantized LLMs poses unique challenges due to the reduced representational precision of quantized weights. In this paper, we introduce CLoQ (Calibrated LoRA initialization for Quantized LLMs), a simplistic initialization strategy designed to overcome these challenges. Our approach focuses on minimizing the layer-wise discrepancy between the original LLM and its quantized counterpart with LoRA components during initialization. By leveraging a small calibration dataset, CLoQ quantizes a pre-trained LLM and determines the optimal LoRA components for each layer, ensuring a strong foundation for subsequent fine-tuning. A key contribution of this work is a novel theoretical result that enables the accurate and closed-form construction of these optimal LoRA components. We validate the efficacy of CLoQ across multiple tasks such as language generation, arithmetic reasoning, and commonsense reasoning, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms existing LoRA fine-tuning methods for quantized LLMs, especially at ultra low-bit widths.

This has the effect of creating a prompt that matches the inductive bias in model.

      Conventional model compression techniques for LLMs address high memory consumption and slow inference challenges but typically require computationally expensive retraining to preserve accuracy. In contrast, one-shot compression methods eliminate retraining cost, but struggle to achieve accuracy comparable to dense models. This paper presents SLIM, a new one-shot compression framework that holistically integrates hardware-friendly quantization, sparsity, and low-rank approximation into a unified process. First, we formulate the quantization process using a probabilistic approach (SLIM-Quant) that enables us to apply uniform quantization. Then, we use an existing one-shot pruning method to apply semi-structured sparsity on top of the quantized weights. Finally, to compensate for the introduced aggregated quantization and sparsity error, we use a novel saliency function with unique invertible and additive features that enables us to mathematically compute the value of low-rank adapters. SLIM improves model accuracy by up to 5.66% (LLaMA-2-7B) for 2:4 sparsity with 4-bit weight quantization, outperforming prior methods. Models compressed with SLIM achieve up to 4.3x and 3.8x on Nvidia RTX3060 and A100 GPUs, respectively. Additionally, they achieve up to 0.23x end-to-end memory reduction in comparison to their dense counterparts. We also propose an optional PEFT recipe that further improves accuracy by up to 1.66% (LLaMA-2-13B) compared to SLIM without fine-tuning.

Given the high volume of research around the biases within the outputs of AI systems and LLMs, it is imperative to conduct systematic literature reviews to document throughlines within such research. In this paper, we conduct such a review of research covering AI/LLM bias in four premier venues/organizations -- *ACL, FAccT, NeurIPS, and AAAI -- published over the past 10 years. Through a coverage of 189 papers, we uncover patterns of bias research and along what axes of human identity they commonly focus. The first emergent pattern within the corpus was that 82% (155/189) papers did not establish a working definition of "bias" for their purposes, opting instead to simply state that biases and stereotypes exist that can have harmful downstream effects while establishing only mathematical and technical definition of bias. 94 of these 155 papers have been published in the past 5 years, after Blodgett et al. (2020)'s literature review with a similar finding about NLP research and recommendation to consider how such researchers should conceptualize bias, going beyond strictly technical definitions. Furthermore, we find that a large majority of papers -- 79.9% or 151/189 papers -- focus on gender bias (mostly, gender and occupation bias) within the outputs of AI systems and LLMs. By demonstrating a strong focus within the field on gender, race/ethnicity (30.2%; 57/189), age (20.6%; 39/189), religion (19.1%; 36/189) and nationality (13.2%; 25/189) bias, we document how researchers adopt a fairly narrow conception of AI bias by overlooking several non-Western communities in fairness research, as we advocate for a stronger coverage of such populations. Finally, we note that while our corpus contains several examples of innovative debiasing methods across the aforementioned aspects of human identity, only 10.6% (20/189) include recommendations for how to implement their findings or contributions in real-world AI systems or design processes. This indicates a concerning academia-industry gap, especially since many of the biases that our corpus contains several successful mitigation methods that still persist within the outputs of AI systems and LLMs commonly used today. We conclude with recommendations towards future AI/LLM fairness research, with stronger focus on diverse marginalized populations.

      Large language models (LLMs) are known to exhibit biases in downstream tasks, especially when dealing with sensitive topics such as political discourse, gender identity, ethnic relations, or national stereotypes. Although significant progress has been made in bias detection and mitigation techniques, certain challenges remain underexplored. This study proposes a reusable, granular, and topic-agnostic framework to evaluate polarisation-related biases in LLM (both open-source and closed-source). Our approach combines polarisation-sensitive sentiment metrics with a synthetically generated balanced dataset of conflict-related statements, using a predefined set of semantic categories. As a case study, we created a synthetic dataset that focusses on the Russia-Ukraine war, and we evaluated the bias in several LLMs: Llama-3, Mistral, GPT-4, Claude 3.5, and Gemini 1.0. Beyond aggregate bias scores, with a general trend for more positive sentiment toward Ukraine, the framework allowed fine-grained analysis with considerable variation between semantic categories, uncovering divergent behavioural patterns among models. Adaptation to prompt modifications showed further bias towards preconceived language and citizenship modification. Overall, the framework supports automated dataset generation and fine-grained bias assessment, is applicable to a variety of polarisation-driven scenarios and topics, and is orthogonal to many other bias-evaluation strategies.

      Large language models (LLMs) have recently gained prominence in the field of software development, significantly boosting productivity and simplifying teamwork. Although prior studies have examined task-specific applications, the phase-specific effects of LLM assistance on the efficiency of code review processes remain underexplored. This research investigates the effect of GPT on GitHub pull request (PR) workflows, with a focus on reducing resolution time, optimizing phase-specific performance, and assisting developers. We curated a dataset of 25,473 PRs from 9,254 GitHub projects and identified GPT-assisted PRs using a semi-automated heuristic approach that combines keyword-based detection, regular expression filtering, and manual verification until achieving 95% labeling accuracy. We then applied statistical modeling, including multiple linear regression and Mann-Whitney U test, to evaluate differences between GPT-assisted and non-assisted PRs, both at the overall resolution level and across distinct review phases. Our research has revealed that early adoption of GPT can substantially boost the effectiveness of the PR process, leading to considerable time savings at various stages. Our findings suggest that GPT-assisted PRs reduced median resolution time by more than 60% (9 hours compared to 23 hours for non-assisted PRs). We discovered that utilizing GPT can reduce the review time by 33% and the waiting time before acceptance by 87%. Analyzing a sample dataset of 300 GPT-assisted PRs, we discovered that developers predominantly use GPT for code optimization (60%), bug fixing (26%), and documentation updates (12%). This research sheds light on the impact of the GPT model on the code review process, offering actionable insights for software teams seeking to enhance workflows and promote seamless collaboration.

      Document fraud poses a significant threat to industries reliant on secure and verifiable documentation, necessitating robust detection mechanisms. This study investigates the efficacy of state-of-the-art multi-modal large language models (LLMs)-including OpenAI O1, OpenAI 4o, Gemini Flash (thinking), Deepseek Janus, Grok, Llama 3.2 and 4, Qwen 2 and 2.5 VL, Mistral Pixtral, and Claude 3.5 and 3.7 Sonnet-in detecting fraudulent documents. We benchmark these models against each other and prior work on document fraud detection techniques using a standard dataset with real transactional documents. Through prompt optimization and detailed analysis of the models' reasoning processes, we evaluate their ability to identify subtle indicators of fraud, such as tampered text, misaligned formatting, and inconsistent transactional sums. Our results reveal that top-performing multi-modal LLMs demonstrate superior zero-shot generalization, outperforming conventional methods on out-of-distribution datasets, while several vision LLMs exhibit inconsistent or subpar performance. Notably, model size and advanced reasoning capabilities show limited correlation with detection accuracy, suggesting task-specific fine-tuning is critical. This study underscores the potential of multi-modal LLMs in enhancing document fraud detection systems and provides a foundation for future research into interpretable and scalable fraud mitigation strategies.

      This paper presents a novel methodology for generating synthetic Preference Optimization (PO) datasets using multi-model workflows. We evaluate the effectiveness and potential of these workflows in automating and enhancing the dataset generation process. PO dataset generation requires two modules: (1) $\textit{response evaluation}$, and (2) $\textit{response generation}$. In the $\textit{response evaluation}$ module, the responses from Large Language Models (LLMs) are evaluated and ranked - a task typically carried out by human annotators that we automate using LLMs. We assess the response evaluation module in a 2 step process. In step 1, we assess LLMs as evaluators using three distinct prompting strategies. In step 2, we apply the winning prompting strategy to compare the performance of LLM-as-a-Judge, LLMs-as-a-Jury, and LLM Debate. Our evaluation shows that GPT-4o-as-a-Judge is more consistent across all datasets. For the $\textit{response generation}$ module, we use the identified LLM evaluator configuration and compare different configurations of the LLM Feedback Loop. We use the win rate to determine the best multi-model configuration for generation. Experimenting with various configurations, we find that the LLM Feedback Loop, with Llama as the generator and Gemma as the reviewer, achieves a notable 71.8% and 73.8% win rate over single-model Llama and Gemma, respectively. After identifying the best configurations for both modules, we generate our PO datasets using the above pipeline.

      By integrating the perception capabilities of multimodal encoders with the generative power of Large Language Models (LLMs), Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), exemplified by GPT-4V, have achieved great success in various multimodal tasks, pointing toward a promising pathway to artificial general intelligence. Despite this progress, the limited quality of multimodal data, poor performance on many complex downstream tasks, and inadequate evaluation protocols continue to hinder the reliability and broader applicability of MLLMs across diverse domains. Inspired by the human ability to leverage external tools for enhanced reasoning and problem-solving, augmenting MLLMs with external tools (e.g., APIs, expert models, and knowledge bases) offers a promising strategy to overcome these challenges. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on leveraging external tools to enhance MLLM performance. Our discussion is structured along four key dimensions about external tools: (1) how they can facilitate the acquisition and annotation of high-quality multimodal data; (2) how they can assist in improving MLLM performance on challenging downstream tasks; (3) how they enable comprehensive and accurate evaluation of MLLMs; (4) the current limitations and future directions of tool-augmented MLLMs. Through this survey, we aim to underscore the transformative potential of external tools in advancing MLLM capabilities, offering a forward-looking perspective on their development and applications.
