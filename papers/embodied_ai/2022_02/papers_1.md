      Embodied AI has seen steady progress across a diverse set of independent tasks. While these varied tasks have different end goals, the basic skills required to complete them successfully overlap significantly. In this paper, our goal is to leverage these shared skills to learn to perform multiple tasks jointly. We propose Atomic Skill Completion (ASC), an approach for multi-task training for Embodied AI, where a set of atomic skills shared across multiple tasks are composed together to perform the tasks. The key to the success of this approach is a pre-training scheme that decouples learning of the skills from the high-level tasks making joint training effective. We use ASC to train agents within the AI2-THOR environment to perform four interactive tasks jointly and find it to be remarkably effective. In a multi-task setting, ASC improves success rates by a factor of 2x on Seen scenes and 4x on Unseen scenes compared to no pre-training. Importantly, ASC enables us to train a multi-task agent that has a 52% higher Success Rate than training 4 independent single task agents. Finally, our hierarchical agents are more interpretable than traditional black-box architectures.
