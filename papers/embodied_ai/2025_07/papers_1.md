      Collective Adaptive Intelligence (CAI) represent a transformative approach in embodied AI, wherein numerous autonomous agents collaborate, adapt, and self-organize to navigate complex, dynamic environments. By enabling systems to reconfigure themselves in response to unforeseen challenges, CAI facilitate robust performance in real-world scenarios. This article introduces a conceptual framework for designing and analyzing CAI. It delineates key attributes including task generalization, resilience, scalability, and self-assembly, aiming to bridge theoretical foundations with practical methodologies for engineering adaptive, emergent intelligence. By providing a structured foundation for understanding and implementing CAI, this work seeks to guide researchers and practitioners in developing more resilient, scalable, and adaptable AI systems across various domains.
