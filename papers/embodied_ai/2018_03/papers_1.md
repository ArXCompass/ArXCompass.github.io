      Advances in Artificial Intelligence and robotics are currently questioning theethical framework of their applications to deal with potential drifts, as well as the way inwhich these algorithms learn because they will have a strong impact on the behavior ofrobots and the type of robots. interactions with people. We would like to highlight someprinciples and ideas from cognitive neuroscience and development sciences based on theimportance of the body for intelligence, contrary to the theory of the all-brain or all-algorithm, to represent the world and interacting with others, and their current applicationsin embodied AI and developmental robotics to propose models of architectures andmechanisms for agency, representation of the body, recognition of the intention of others,predictive coding, active inference, the role of feedback and error, imitation, artificialcuriosity and contextual learning. We will explain how these are important for the design ofautonomous systems and beyond what they can tell us for the ethics of systems.
