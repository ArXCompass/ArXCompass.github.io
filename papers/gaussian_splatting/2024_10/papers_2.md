In particular, with the pretrained diffusion models, existing methods predominantly use Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to train 3D models such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS). However, a hurdle is that they often encounter difficulties with over-smoothing textures and over-saturating colors. The rectified flow model -- which utilizes a simple ordinary differential equation (ODE) to represent a straight trajectory -- shows promise as an alternative prior to text-to-3D generation. It learns a time-independent vector field, thereby reducing the ambiguity in 3D model update gradients that are calculated using time-dependent scores in the SDS framework. In light of this, we first develop a mathematical analysis to seamlessly integrate SDS with rectified flow model, paving the way for our initial framework known as Vector Field Distillation Sampling (VFDS). However, empirical findings indicate that VFDS still results in over-smoothing outcomes. Therefore, we analyze the grounding reasons for such a failure from the perspective of ODE trajectories. On top, we propose a novel framework, named FlowDreamer, which yields high fidelity results with richer textual details and faster convergence. The key insight is to leverage the coupling and reversible properties of the rectified flow model to search for the corresponding noise, rather than using randomly sampled noise as in VFDS. Accordingly, we introduce a novel Unique Couple Matching (UCM) loss, which guides the 3D model to optimize along the same trajectory.

      Reconstructing endoscopic videos is crucial for high-fidelity visualization and the efficiency of surgical operations. Despite the importance, existing 3D reconstruction methods encounter several challenges, including stringent demands for accuracy, imprecise camera positioning, intricate dynamic scenes, and the necessity for rapid reconstruction. Addressing these issues, this paper presents the first camera-pose-free scene reconstruction framework, Free-DyGS, tailored for dynamic surgical videos, leveraging 3D Gaussian splatting technology. Our approach employs a frame-by-frame reconstruction strategy and is delineated into four distinct phases: Scene Initialization, Joint Learning, Scene Expansion, and Retrospective Learning. We introduce a Generalizable Gaussians Parameterization module within the Scene Initialization and Expansion phases to proficiently generate Gaussian attributes for each pixel from the RGBD frames. The Joint Learning phase is crafted to concurrently deduce scene deformation and camera pose, facilitated by an innovative flexible deformation module. In the scene expansion stage, the Gaussian points gradually grow as the camera moves. The Retrospective Learning phase is dedicated to enhancing the precision of scene deformation through the reassessment of prior frames. The efficacy of the proposed Free-DyGS is substantiated through experiments on two datasets: the StereoMIS and Hamlyn datasets. The experimental outcomes underscore that Free-DyGS surpasses conventional baseline models in both rendering fidelity and computational efficiency.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Reconstructing 3D scenes from multiple viewpoints is a fundamental task in stereo vision. Recently, advances in generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting have enabled high-quality novel view synthesis for unseen scenes from sparse input views by feed-forward predicting per-pixel Gaussian parameters without extra optimization. However, existing methods typically generate single-scale 3D Gaussians, which lack representation of both large-scale structure and texture details, resulting in mislocation and artefacts. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, HiSplat, which introduces a hierarchical manner in generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting to construct hierarchical 3D Gaussians via a coarse-to-fine strategy. Specifically, HiSplat generates large coarse-grained Gaussians to capture large-scale structures, followed by fine-grained Gaussians to enhance delicate texture details. To promote inter-scale interactions, we propose an Error Aware Module for Gaussian compensation and a Modulating Fusion Module for Gaussian repair. Our method achieves joint optimization of hierarchical representations, allowing for novel view synthesis using only two-view reference images. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that HiSplat significantly enhances reconstruction quality and cross-dataset generalization compared to prior single-scale methods. The corresponding ablation study and analysis of different-scale 3D Gaussians reveal the mechanism behind the effectiveness. Project website: https://open3dvlab.github.io/HiSplat/

      We present GSLoc: a new visual localization method that performs dense camera alignment using 3D Gaussian Splatting as a map representation of the scene. GSLoc backpropagates pose gradients over the rendering pipeline to align the rendered and target images, while it adopts a coarse-to-fine strategy by utilizing blurring kernels to mitigate the non-convexity of the problem and improve the convergence. The results show that our approach succeeds at visual localization in challenging conditions of relatively small overlap between initial and target frames inside textureless environments when state-of-the-art neural sparse methods provide inferior results. Using the byproduct of realistic rendering from the 3DGS map representation, we show how to enhance localization results by mixing a set of observed and virtual reference keyframes when solving the image retrieval problem. We evaluate our method both on synthetic and real-world data, discussing its advantages and application potential.

      Many recent developments for robots to represent environments have focused on photorealistic reconstructions. This paper particularly focuses on generating sequences of images from the photorealistic Gaussian Splatting models, that match instructions that are given by user-inputted language. We contribute a novel framework, SplaTraj, which formulates the generation of images within photorealistic environment representations as a continuous-time trajectory optimization problem. Costs are designed so that a camera following the trajectory poses will smoothly traverse through the environment and render the specified spatial information in a photogenic manner. This is achieved by querying a photorealistic representation with language embedding to isolate regions that correspond to the user-specified inputs. These regions are then projected to the camera's view as it moves over time and a cost is constructed. We can then apply gradient-based optimization and differentiate through the rendering to optimize the trajectory for the defined cost. The resulting trajectory moves to photogenically view each of the specified objects. We empirically evaluate our approach on a suite of environments and instructions, and demonstrate the quality of generated image sequences.

      Accurate and efficient 3D reconstruction of trees is crucial for forest resource assessments and management. Close-Range Photogrammetry (CRP) is commonly used for reconstructing forest scenes but faces challenges like low efficiency and poor quality. Recently, Novel View Synthesis (NVS) technologies, including Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have shown promise for 3D plant reconstruction with limited images. However, existing research mainly focuses on small plants in orchards or individual trees, leaving uncertainty regarding their application in larger, complex forest stands. In this study, we collected sequential images of forest plots with varying complexity and performed dense reconstruction using NeRF and 3DGS. The resulting point clouds were compared with those from photogrammetry and laser scanning. Results indicate that NVS methods significantly enhance reconstruction efficiency. Photogrammetry struggles with complex stands, leading to point clouds with excessive canopy noise and incorrectly reconstructed trees, such as duplicated trunks. NeRF, while better for canopy regions, may produce errors in ground areas with limited views. The 3DGS method generates sparser point clouds, particularly in trunk areas, affecting diameter at breast height (DBH) accuracy. All three methods can extract tree height information, with NeRF yielding the highest accuracy; however, photogrammetry remains superior for DBH accuracy. These findings suggest that NVS methods have significant potential for 3D reconstruction of forest stands, offering valuable support for complex forest resource inventory and visualization tasks.

      Diffusion-based 2D virtual try-on (VTON) techniques have recently demonstrated strong performance, while the development of 3D VTON has largely lagged behind. Despite recent advances in text-guided 3D scene editing, integrating 2D VTON into these pipelines to achieve vivid 3D VTON remains challenging. The reasons are twofold. First, text prompts cannot provide sufficient details in describing clothing. Second, 2D VTON results generated from different viewpoints of the same 3D scene lack coherence and spatial relationships, hence frequently leading to appearance inconsistencies and geometric distortions. To resolve these problems, we introduce an image-prompted 3D VTON method (dubbed GS-VTON) which, by leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as the 3D representation, enables the transfer of pre-trained knowledge from 2D VTON models to 3D while improving cross-view consistency. (1) Specifically, we propose a personalized diffusion model that utilizes low-rank adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning to incorporate personalized information into pre-trained 2D VTON models. To achieve effective LoRA training, we introduce a reference-driven image editing approach that enables the simultaneous editing of multi-view images while ensuring consistency. (2) Furthermore, we propose a persona-aware 3DGS editing framework to facilitate effective editing while maintaining consistent cross-view appearance and high-quality 3D geometry. (3) Additionally, we have established a new 3D VTON benchmark, 3D-VTONBench, which facilitates comprehensive qualitative and quantitative 3D VTON evaluations. Through extensive experiments and comparative analyses with existing methods, the proposed \OM has demonstrated superior fidelity and advanced editing capabilities, affirming its effectiveness for 3D VTON.

      LiDAR simulation plays a crucial role in closed-loop simulation for autonomous driving. Although recent advancements, such as the use of reconstructed mesh and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), have made progress in simulating the physical properties of LiDAR, these methods have struggled to achieve satisfactory frame rates and rendering quality. To address these limitations, we present LiDAR-GS, the first LiDAR Gaussian Splatting method, for real-time high-fidelity re-simulation of LiDAR sensor scans in public urban road scenes. The vanilla Gaussian Splatting, designed for camera models, cannot be directly applied to LiDAR re-simulation. To bridge the gap between passive camera and active LiDAR, our LiDAR-GS designs a differentiable laser beam splatting, grounded in the LiDAR range view model. This innovation allows for precise surface splatting by projecting lasers onto micro cross-sections, effectively eliminating artifacts associated with local affine approximations. Additionally, LiDAR-GS leverages Neural Gaussian Fields, which further integrate view-dependent clues, to represent key LiDAR properties that are influenced by the incident angle and external factors. Combining these practices with some essential adaptations, e.g., dynamic instances decomposition, our approach succeeds in simultaneously re-simulating depth, intensity, and ray-drop channels, achieving state-of-the-art results in both rendering frame rate and quality on publically available large scene datasets. Our source code will be made publicly available.

      Novel view synthesis (NVS) enables to generate new images of a scene or convert a set of 2D images into a comprehensive 3D model. In the context of Space Domain Awareness, since space is becoming increasingly congested, NVS can accurately map space objects and debris, improving the safety and efficiency of space operations. Similarly, in Rendezvous and Proximity Operations missions, 3D models can provide details about a target object's shape, size, and orientation, allowing for better planning and prediction of the target's behavior. In this work, we explore the generalization abilities of these reconstruction techniques, aiming to avoid the necessity of retraining for each new scene, by presenting a novel approach to 3D spacecraft reconstruction from single-view images, DreamSat, by fine-tuning the Zero123 XL, a state-of-the-art single-view reconstruction model, on a high-quality dataset of 190 high-quality spacecraft models and integrating it into the DreamGaussian framework. We demonstrate consistent improvements in reconstruction quality across multiple metrics, including Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) score (+0.33%), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) (+2.53%), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) (+2.38%), and Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) (+0.16%) on a test set of 30 previously unseen spacecraft images. Our method addresses the lack of domain-specific 3D reconstruction tools in the space industry by leveraging state-of-the-art diffusion models and 3D Gaussian splatting techniques. This approach maintains the efficiency of the DreamGaussian framework while enhancing the accuracy and detail of spacecraft reconstructions.

      Building accurate representations of the environment is critical for intelligent robots to make decisions during deployment. Advances in photorealistic environment models have enabled robots to develop hyper-realistic reconstructions, which can be used to generate images that are intuitive for human inspection. In particular, the recently introduced \ac{3DGS}, which describes the scene with up to millions of primitive ellipsoids, can be rendered in real time. \ac{3DGS} has rapidly gained prominence. However, a critical unsolved problem persists: how can we fuse multiple \ac{3DGS} into a single coherent model? Solving this problem will enable robot teams to jointly build \ac{3DGS} models of their surroundings. A key insight of this work is to leverage the {duality} between photorealistic reconstructions, which render realistic 2D images from 3D structure, and \emph{3D foundation models}, which predict 3D structure from image pairs. To this end, we develop PhotoReg, a framework to register multiple photorealistic \ac{3DGS} models with 3D foundation models. As \ac{3DGS} models are generally built from monocular camera images, they have \emph{arbitrary scale}. To resolve this, PhotoReg actively enforces scale consistency among the different \ac{3DGS} models by considering depth estimates within these models. Then, the alignment is iteratively refined with fine-grained photometric losses to produce high-quality fused \ac{3DGS} models. We rigorously evaluate PhotoReg on both standard benchmark datasets and our custom-collected datasets, including with two quadruped robots. The code is released at \url{ziweny11.github.io/photoreg}.

      3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has already become the emerging research focus in the fields of 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Given that training a 3DGS requires a significant amount of time and computational cost, it is crucial to protect the copyright, integrity, and privacy of such 3D assets. Steganography, as a crucial technique for encrypted transmission and copyright protection, has been extensively studied. However, it still lacks profound exploration targeted at 3DGS. Unlike its predecessor NeRF, 3DGS possesses two distinct features: 1) explicit 3D representation; and 2) real-time rendering speeds. These characteristics result in the 3DGS point cloud files being public and transparent, with each Gaussian point having a clear physical significance. Therefore, ensuring the security and fidelity of the original 3D scene while embedding information into the 3DGS point cloud files is an extremely challenging task. To solve the above-mentioned issue, we first propose a steganography framework for 3DGS, dubbed GS-Hider, which can embed 3D scenes and images into original GS point clouds in an invisible manner and accurately extract the hidden messages. Specifically, we design a coupled secured feature attribute to replace the original 3DGS's spherical harmonics coefficients and then use a scene decoder and a message decoder to disentangle the original RGB scene and the hidden message. Extensive experiments demonstrated that the proposed GS-Hider can effectively conceal multimodal messages without compromising rendering quality and possesses exceptional security, robustness, capacity, and flexibility.

      This report describes our 1st place solution to the 8th HANDS workshop challenge (ARCTIC track) in conjunction with ECCV 2024. In this challenge, we address the task of bimanual category-agnostic hand-object interaction reconstruction, which aims to generate 3D reconstructions of both hands and the object from a monocular video, without relying on predefined templates. This task is particularly challenging due to the significant occlusion and dynamic contact between the hands and the object during bimanual manipulation. We worked to resolve these issues by introducing a mask loss and a 3D contact loss, respectively. Moreover, we applied 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to this task.

      We present a novel-view rendering algorithm, Mode-GS, for ground-robot trajectory datasets. Our approach is based on using anchored Gaussian splats, which are designed to overcome the limitations of existing 3D Gaussian splatting algorithms. Prior neural rendering methods suffer from severe splat drift due to scene complexity and insufficient multi-view observation, and can fail to fix splats on the true geometry in ground-robot datasets. Our method integrates pixel-aligned anchors from monocular depths and generates Gaussian splats around these anchors using residual-form Gaussian decoders. To address the inherent scale ambiguity of monocular depth, we parameterize anchors with per-view depth-scales and employ scale-consistent depth loss for online scale calibration. Our method results in improved rendering performance, based on PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics, in ground scenes with free trajectory patterns, and achieves state-of-the-art rendering performance on the R3LIVE odometry dataset and the Tanks and Temples dataset.

      Dynamic scene reconstruction using Gaussians has recently attracted increased interest. Mainstream approaches typically employ a global deformation field to warp a 3D scene in canonical space. However, the inherent low-frequency nature of implicit neural fields often leads to ineffective representations of complex motions. Moreover, their structural rigidity can hinder adaptation to scenes with varying resolutions and durations. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach for streaming 4D real-world reconstruction utilizing discrete 3D control points. This method physically models local rays and establishes a motion-decoupling coordinate system. By effectively merging traditional graphics with learnable pipelines, it provides a robust and efficient local 6-degrees-of-freedom (6-DoF) motion representation. Additionally, we have developed a generalized framework that integrates our control points with Gaussians. Starting from an initial 3D reconstruction, our workflow decomposes the streaming 4D reconstruction into four independent submodules: 3D segmentation, 3D control point generation, object-wise motion manipulation, and residual compensation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art 4D Gaussian splatting techniques on both the Neu3DV and CMU-Panoptic datasets. Notably, the optimization of our 3D control points is achievable in 100 iterations and within just 2 seconds per frame on a single NVIDIA 4070 GPU.

      Recently, with the development of Neural Radiance Fields and Gaussian Splatting, 3D reconstruction techniques have achieved remarkably high fidelity. However, the latent representations learnt by these methods are highly entangled and lack interpretability. In this paper, we propose a novel part-aware compositional reconstruction method, called GaussianBlock, that enables semantically coherent and disentangled representations, allowing for precise and physical editing akin to building blocks, while simultaneously maintaining high fidelity. Our GaussianBlock introduces a hybrid representation that leverages the advantages of both primitives, known for their flexible actionability and editability, and 3D Gaussians, which excel in reconstruction quality. Specifically, we achieve semantically coherent primitives through a novel attention-guided centering loss derived from 2D semantic priors, complemented by a dynamic splitting and fusion strategy. Furthermore, we utilize 3D Gaussians that hybridize with primitives to refine structural details and enhance fidelity. Additionally, a binding inheritance strategy is employed to strengthen and maintain the connection between the two. Our reconstructed scenes are evidenced to be disentangled, compositional, and compact across diverse benchmarks, enabling seamless, direct and precise editing while maintaining high quality.

      Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a promising approach for modeling 3D scenes using mixtures of Gaussians. The predominant optimization method for these models relies on backpropagating gradients through a differentiable rendering pipeline, which struggles with catastrophic forgetting when dealing with continuous streams of data. To address this limitation, we propose Variational Bayes Gaussian Splatting (VBGS), a novel approach that frames training a Gaussian splat as variational inference over model parameters. By leveraging the conjugacy properties of multivariate Gaussians, we derive a closed-form variational update rule, allowing efficient updates from partial, sequential observations without the need for replay buffers. Our experiments show that VBGS not only matches state-of-the-art performance on static datasets, but also enables continual learning from sequentially streamed 2D and 3D data, drastically improving performance in this setting.

      We present GI-GS, a novel inverse rendering framework that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and deferred shading to achieve photo-realistic novel view synthesis and relighting. In inverse rendering, accurately modeling the shading processes of objects is essential for achieving high-fidelity results. Therefore, it is critical to incorporate global illumination to account for indirect lighting that reaches an object after multiple bounces across the scene. Previous 3DGS-based methods have attempted to model indirect lighting by characterizing indirect illumination as learnable lighting volumes or additional attributes of each Gaussian, while using baked occlusion to represent shadow effects. These methods, however, fail to accurately model the complex physical interactions between light and objects, making it impossible to construct realistic indirect illumination during relighting. To address this limitation, we propose to calculate indirect lighting using efficient path tracing with deferred shading. In our framework, we first render a G-buffer to capture the detailed geometry and material properties of the scene. Then, we perform physically-based rendering (PBR) only for direct lighting. With the G-buffer and previous rendering results, the indirect lighting can be calculated through a lightweight path tracing. Our method effectively models indirect lighting under any given lighting conditions, thereby achieving better novel view synthesis and relighting. Quantitative and qualitative results show that our GI-GS outperforms existing baselines in both rendering quality and efficiency.

      In this paper, we propose SRIF, a novel Semantic shape Registration framework based on diffusion-based Image morphing and Flow estimation. More concretely, given a pair of extrinsically aligned shapes, we first render them from multi-views, and then utilize an image interpolation framework based on diffusion models to generate sequences of intermediate images between them. The images are later fed into a dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting framework, with which we reconstruct and post-process for intermediate point clouds respecting the image morphing processing. In the end, tailored for the above, we propose a novel registration module to estimate continuous normalizing flow, which deforms source shape consistently towards the target, with intermediate point clouds as weak guidance. Our key insight is to leverage large vision models (LVMs) to associate shapes and therefore obtain much richer semantic information on the relationship between shapes than the ad-hoc feature extraction and alignment. As a consequence, SRIF achieves high-quality dense correspondences on challenging shape pairs, but also delivers smooth, semantically meaningful interpolation in between. Empirical evidence justifies the effectiveness and superiority of our method as well as specific design choices. The code is released at https://github.com/rqhuang88/SRIF.

      Recent works in volume rendering, \textit{e.g.} NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), significantly advance the rendering quality and efficiency with the help of the learned implicit neural radiance field or 3D Gaussians. Rendering on top of an explicit representation, the vanilla 3DGS and its variants deliver real-time efficiency by optimizing the parametric model with single-view supervision per iteration during training which is adopted from NeRF. Consequently, certain views are overfitted, leading to unsatisfying appearance in novel-view synthesis and imprecise 3D geometries. To solve aforementioned problems, we propose a new 3DGS optimization method embodying four key novel contributions: 1) We transform the conventional single-view training paradigm into a multi-view training strategy. With our proposed multi-view regulation, 3D Gaussian attributes are further optimized without overfitting certain training views. As a general solution, we improve the overall accuracy in a variety of scenarios and different Gaussian variants. 2) Inspired by the benefit introduced by additional views, we further propose a cross-intrinsic guidance scheme, leading to a coarse-to-fine training procedure concerning different resolutions. 3) Built on top of our multi-view regulated training, we further propose a cross-ray densification strategy, densifying more Gaussian kernels in the ray-intersect regions from a selection of views. 4) By further investigating the densification strategy, we found that the effect of densification should be enhanced when certain views are distinct dramatically. As a solution, we propose a novel multi-view augmented densification strategy, where 3D Gaussians are encouraged to get densified to a sufficient number accordingly, resulting in improved reconstruction accuracy.

      The recent advancements in 3D Gaussian splatting (3D-GS) have not only facilitated real-time rendering through modern GPU rasterization pipelines but have also attained state-of-the-art rendering quality. Nevertheless, despite its exceptional rendering quality and performance on standard datasets, 3D-GS frequently encounters difficulties in accurately modeling specular and anisotropic components. This issue stems from the limited ability of spherical harmonics (SH) to represent high-frequency information. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Spec-Gaussian, an approach that utilizes an anisotropic spherical Gaussian (ASG) appearance field instead of SH for modeling the view-dependent appearance of each 3D Gaussian. Additionally, we have developed a coarse-to-fine training strategy to improve learning efficiency and eliminate floaters caused by overfitting in real-world scenes. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches in terms of rendering quality. Thanks to ASG, we have significantly improved the ability of 3D-GS to model scenes with specular and anisotropic components without increasing the number of 3D Gaussians. This improvement extends the applicability of 3D GS to handle intricate scenarios with specular and anisotropic surfaces. Project page is https://ingra14m.github.io/Spec-Gaussian-website/.

This framework enhances the localization accuracy of state-of-the-art absolute pose regression and scene coordinate regression methods. The 3DGS model renders high-quality synthetic images and depth maps to facilitate the establishment of 2D-3D correspondences. GSLoc obviates the need for training feature extractors or descriptors by operating directly on RGB images, utilizing the 3D foundation model, MASt3R, for precise 2D matching. To improve the robustness of our model in challenging outdoor environments, we incorporate an exposure-adaptive module within the 3DGS framework. Consequently, GSLoc enables efficient one-shot pose refinement given a single RGB query and a coarse initial pose estimation. Our proposed approach surpasses leading NeRF-based optimization methods in both accuracy and runtime across indoor and outdoor visual localization benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art accuracy on two indoor datasets.

      Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) are widely used for novel-view synthesis and have been adapted for 3D Object Detection (3DOD), offering a promising approach to 3DOD through view-synthesis representation. However, NeRF faces inherent limitations: (i) limited representational capacity for 3DOD due to its implicit nature, and (ii) slow rendering speeds. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as an explicit 3D representation that addresses these limitations. Inspired by these advantages, this paper introduces 3DGS into 3DOD for the first time, identifying two main challenges: (i) Ambiguous spatial distribution of Gaussian blobs: 3DGS primarily relies on 2D pixel-level supervision, resulting in unclear 3D spatial distribution of Gaussian blobs and poor differentiation between objects and background, which hinders 3DOD; (ii) Excessive background blobs: 2D images often include numerous background pixels, leading to densely reconstructed 3DGS with many noisy Gaussian blobs representing the background, negatively affecting detection. To tackle the challenge (i), we leverage the fact that 3DGS reconstruction is derived from 2D images, and propose an elegant and efficient solution by incorporating 2D Boundary Guidance to significantly enhance the spatial distribution of Gaussian blobs, resulting in clearer differentiation between objects and their background. To address the challenge (ii), we propose a Box-Focused Sampling strategy using 2D boxes to generate object probability distribution in 3D spaces, allowing effective probabilistic sampling in 3D to retain more object blobs and reduce noisy background blobs. Benefiting from our designs, our 3DGS-DET significantly outperforms the SOTA NeRF-based method, NeRF-Det, achieving improvements of +6.6 on mAP@0.25 and +8.1 on mAP@0.5 for the ScanNet dataset, and impressive +31.5 on mAP@0.25 for the ARKITScenes dataset.

      Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) have revolutionized novel view synthesis, facilitating real-time, high-quality image rendering. However, in scenarios involving reflective surfaces, particularly mirrors, 3D-GS often misinterprets reflections as virtual spaces, resulting in blurred and inconsistent multi-view rendering within mirrors. Our paper presents a novel method aimed at obtaining high-quality multi-view consistent reflection rendering by modelling reflections as physically-based virtual cameras. We estimate mirror planes with depth and normal estimates from 3D-GS and define virtual cameras that are placed symmetrically about the mirror plane. These virtual cameras are then used to explain mirror reflections in the scene. To address imperfections in mirror plane estimates, we propose a straightforward yet effective virtual camera optimization method to enhance reflection quality. We collect a new mirror dataset including three real-world scenarios for more diverse evaluation. Experimental validation on both Mirror-Nerf and our real-world dataset demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. We achieve comparable or superior results while significantly reducing training time compared to previous state-of-the-art.

      Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) approximate discrete data through continuous functions and are commonly used for encoding 2D images. Traditional image-based INRs employ neural networks to map pixel coordinates to RGB values, capturing shapes, colors, and textures within the network's weights. Recently, GaussianImage has been proposed as an alternative, using Gaussian functions instead of neural networks to achieve comparable quality and compression. Such a solution obtains a quality and compression ratio similar to classical INR models but does not allow image modification. In contrast, our work introduces a novel method, MiraGe, which uses mirror reflections to perceive 2D images in 3D space and employs flat-controlled Gaussians for precise 2D image editing. Our approach improves the rendering quality and allows realistic image modifications, including human-inspired perception of photos in the 3D world. Thanks to modeling images in 3D space, we obtain the illusion of 3D-based modification in 2D images. We also show that our Gaussian representation can be easily combined with a physics engine to produce physics-based modification of 2D images. Consequently, MiraGe allows for better quality than the standard approach and natural modification of 2D images.

      The feed-forward based 3D Gaussian Splatting method has demonstrated exceptional capability in real-time human novel view synthesis. However, existing approaches are restricted to dense viewpoint settings, which limits their flexibility in free-viewpoint rendering across a wide range of camera view angle discrepancies. To address this limitation, we propose a real-time pipeline named EVA-Gaussian for 3D human novel view synthesis across diverse camera settings. Specifically, we first introduce an Efficient cross-View Attention (EVA) module to accurately estimate the position of each 3D Gaussian from the source images. Then, we integrate the source images with the estimated Gaussian position map to predict the attributes and feature embeddings of the 3D Gaussians. Moreover, we employ a recurrent feature refiner to correct artifacts caused by geometric errors in position estimation and enhance visual fidelity.To further improve synthesis quality, we incorporate a powerful anchor loss function for both 3D Gaussian attributes and human face landmarks. Experimental results on the THuman2.0 and THumansit datasets showcase the superiority of our EVA-Gaussian approach in rendering quality across diverse camera settings.

      Skins wrapping around our bodies, leathers covering over the sofa, sheet metal coating the car - it suggests that objects are enclosed by a series of continuous surfaces, which provides us with informative geometry prior for objectness deduction. In this paper, we propose Gaussian-Det which leverages Gaussian Splatting as surface representation for multi-view based 3D object detection. Unlike existing monocular or NeRF-based methods which depict the objects via discrete positional data, Gaussian-Det models the objects in a continuous manner by formulating the input Gaussians as feature descriptors on a mass of partial surfaces. Furthermore, to address the numerous outliers inherently introduced by Gaussian splatting, we accordingly devise a Closure Inferring Module (CIM) for the comprehensive surface-based objectness deduction. CIM firstly estimates the probabilistic feature residuals for partial surfaces given the underdetermined nature of Gaussian Splatting, which are then coalesced into a holistic representation on the overall surface closure of the object proposal. In this way, the surface information Gaussian-Det exploits serves as the prior on the quality and reliability of objectness and the information basis of proposal refinement. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Gaussian-Det outperforms various existing approaches, in terms of both average precision and recall.

      Score distillation sampling (SDS) has emerged as an effective framework in text-driven 3D editing tasks, leveraging diffusion models for 3D consistent editing. However, existing SDS-based 3D editing methods suffer from long training times and produce low-quality results. We identify that the root cause of this performance degradation is their conflict with the sampling dynamics of diffusion models. Addressing this conflict allows us to treat SDS as a diffusion reverse process for 3D editing via sampling from data space. In contrast, existing methods naively distill the score function using diffusion models. From these insights, we propose DreamCatalyst, a novel framework that considers these sampling dynamics in the SDS framework. Specifically, we devise the optimization process of our DreamCatalyst to approximate the diffusion reverse process in editing tasks, thereby aligning with diffusion sampling dynamics. As a result, DreamCatalyst successfully reduces training time and improves editing quality. Our method offers two modes: (1) a fast mode that edits Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) scenes approximately 23 times faster than current state-of-the-art NeRF editing methods, and (2) a high-quality mode that produces superior results about 8 times faster than these methods. Notably, our high-quality mode outperforms current state-of-the-art NeRF editing methods in terms of both speed and quality.

To better understand these activities, it is crucial to model their interactions with the environment captured through dynamic changes. The recent availability of affordable head-mounted cameras and egocentric data offers a more accessible and efficient means to understand human-object interactions in 3D environments. However, most existing methods for human activity modeling neglect the dynamic interactions with objects, resulting in only static representations. The few existing solutions often require inputs from multiple sources, including multi-camera setups, depth-sensing cameras, or kinesthetic sensors. To this end, we introduce EgoGaussian, the first method capable of simultaneously reconstructing 3D scenes and dynamically tracking 3D object motion from RGB egocentric input alone. We leverage the uniquely discrete nature of Gaussian Splatting and segment dynamic interactions from the background, with both having explicit representations.

      Arthroscopy is a minimally invasive surgical procedure used to diagnose and treat joint problems. The clinical workflow of arthroscopy typically involves inserting an arthroscope into the joint through a small incision, during which surgeons navigate and operate largely by relying on their visual assessment through the arthroscope. However, the arthroscope's restricted field of view and lack of depth perception pose challenges in navigating complex articular structures and achieving surgical precision during procedures. Aiming at enhancing intraoperative awareness, we present a robust pipeline that incorporates simultaneous localization and mapping, depth estimation, and 3D Gaussian splatting to realistically reconstruct intra-articular structures solely based on monocular arthroscope video. Extending 3D reconstruction to Augmented Reality (AR) applications, our solution offers AR assistance for articular notch measurement and annotation anchoring in a human-in-the-loop manner.
