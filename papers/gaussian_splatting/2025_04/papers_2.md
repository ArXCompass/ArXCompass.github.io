      Reconstructing and decomposing dynamic urban scenes is crucial for autonomous driving, urban planning, and scene editing. However, existing methods fail to perform instance-aware decomposition without manual annotations, which is crucial for instance-level scene editing.We propose UnIRe, a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based approach that decomposes a scene into a static background and individual dynamic instances using only RGB images and LiDAR point clouds. At its core, we introduce 4D superpoints, a novel representation that clusters multi-frame LiDAR points in 4D space, enabling unsupervised instance separation based on spatiotemporal correlations. These 4D superpoints serve as the foundation for our decomposed 4D initialization, i.e., providing spatial and temporal initialization to train a dynamic 3DGS for arbitrary dynamic classes without requiring bounding boxes or object templates.Furthermore, we introduce a smoothness regularization strategy in both 2D and 3D space, further improving the temporal stability.Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing methods in decomposed dynamic scene reconstruction while enabling accurate and flexible instance-level editing, making it a practical solution for real-world applications.

      In this work, we introduce Monocular and Generalizable Gaussian Talking Head Animation (MGGTalk), which requires monocular datasets and generalizes to unseen identities without personalized re-training. Compared with previous 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods that requires elusive multi-view datasets or tedious personalized learning/inference, MGGtalk enables more practical and broader applications. However, in the absence of multi-view and personalized training data, the incompleteness of geometric and appearance information poses a significant challenge. To address these challenges, MGGTalk explores depth information to enhance geometric and facial symmetry characteristics to supplement both geometric and appearance features. Initially, based on the pixel-wise geometric information obtained from depth estimation, we incorporate symmetry operations and point cloud filtering techniques to ensure a complete and precise position parameter for 3DGS. Subsequently, we adopt a two-stage strategy with symmetric priors for predicting the remaining 3DGS parameters. We begin by predicting Gaussian parameters for the visible facial regions of the source image. These parameters are subsequently utilized to improve the prediction of Gaussian parameters for the non-visible regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGGTalk surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance across various metrics.

      LiDAR-camera systems have become increasingly popular in robotics recently. A critical and initial step in integrating the LiDAR and camera data is the calibration of the LiDAR-camera system. Most existing calibration methods rely on auxiliary target objects, which often involve complex manual operations, whereas targetless methods have yet to achieve practical effectiveness. Recognizing that 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) can reconstruct geometric information from camera image sequences, we propose a calibration method that estimates LiDAR-camera extrinsic parameters using geometric constraints. The proposed method begins by reconstructing colorless 2DGS using LiDAR point clouds. Subsequently, we update the colors of the Gaussian splats by minimizing the photometric loss. The extrinsic parameters are optimized during this process. Additionally, we address the limitations of the photometric loss by incorporating the reprojection and triangulation losses, thereby enhancing the calibration robustness and accuracy.

      We present a novel approach, termed ADGaussian, for generalizable street scene reconstruction. The proposed method enables high-quality rendering from single-view input. Unlike prior Gaussian Splatting methods that primarily focus on geometry refinement, we emphasize the importance of joint optimization of image and depth features for accurate Gaussian prediction. To this end, we first incorporate sparse LiDAR depth as an additional input modality, formulating the Gaussian prediction process as a joint learning framework of visual information and geometric clue. Furthermore, we propose a multi-modal feature matching strategy coupled with a multi-scale Gaussian decoding model to enhance the joint refinement of multi-modal features, thereby enabling efficient multi-modal Gaussian learning. Extensive experiments on two large-scale autonomous driving datasets, Waymo and KITTI, demonstrate that our ADGaussian achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits superior zero-shot generalization capabilities in novel-view shifting.

      The reconstruction of immersive and realistic 3D scenes holds significant practical importance in various fields of computer vision and computer graphics. Typically, immersive and realistic scenes should be free from obstructions by dynamic objects, maintain global texture consistency, and allow for unrestricted exploration. The current mainstream methods for image-driven scene construction involves iteratively refining the initial image using a moving virtual camera to generate the scene. However, previous methods struggle with visual discontinuities due to global texture inconsistencies under varying camera poses, and they frequently exhibit scene voids caused by foreground-background occlusions. To this end, we propose a novel layered 3D scene reconstruction framework from panoramic image, named Scene4U. Specifically, Scene4U integrates an open-vocabulary segmentation model with a large language model to decompose a real panorama into multiple layers. Then, we employs a layered repair module based on diffusion model to restore occluded regions using visual cues and depth information, generating a hierarchical representation of the scene. The multi-layer panorama is then initialized as a 3D Gaussian Splatting representation, followed by layered optimization, which ultimately produces an immersive 3D scene with semantic and structural consistency that supports free exploration. Scene4U outperforms state-of-the-art method, improving by 24.24% in LPIPS and 24.40% in BRISQUE, while also achieving the fastest training speed. Additionally, to demonstrate the robustness of Scene4U and allow users to experience immersive scenes from various landmarks, we build WorldVista3D dataset for 3D scene reconstruction, which contains panoramic images of globally renowned sites. The implementation code and dataset will be released at https://github.com/LongHZ140516/Scene4U .
