      3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as an efficient photorealistic novel view synthesis method. However, its reliance on sparse Structure-from-Motion (SfM) point clouds consistently compromises the scene reconstruction quality. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel 3D reconstruction framework Gaussian Processes Gaussian Splatting (GP-GS), where a multi-output Gaussian Process model is developed to achieve adaptive and uncertainty-guided densification of sparse SfM point clouds. Specifically, we propose a dynamic sampling and filtering pipeline that adaptively expands the SfM point clouds by leveraging GP-based predictions to infer new candidate points from the input 2D pixels and depth maps. The pipeline utilizes uncertainty estimates to guide the pruning of high-variance predictions, ensuring geometric consistency and enabling the generation of dense point clouds. The densified point clouds provide high-quality initial 3D Gaussians to enhance reconstruction performance. Extensive experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets across various scales validate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed framework.

      Representing 3D scenes from multiview images is a core challenge in computer vision and graphics, which requires both precise rendering and accurate reconstruction. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has garnered significant attention for its high-quality rendering and fast inference speed. Yet, due to the unstructured and irregular nature of Gaussian point clouds, ensuring accurate geometry reconstruction remains difficult. Existing methods primarily focus on geometry regularization, with common approaches including primitive-based and dual-model frameworks. However, the former suffers from inherent conflicts between rendering and reconstruction, while the latter is computationally and storage-intensive. To address these challenges, we propose CarGS, a unified model leveraging Contribution-adaptive regularization to achieve simultaneous, high-quality rendering and surface reconstruction. The essence of our framework is learning adaptive contribution for Gaussian primitives by squeezing the knowledge from geometry regularization into a compact MLP. Additionally, we introduce a geometry-guided densification strategy with clues from both normals and Signed Distance Fields (SDF) to improve the capability of capturing high-frequency details. Our design improves the mutual learning of the two tasks, meanwhile its unified structure does not require separate models as in dual-model based approaches, guaranteeing efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate the ability to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in both rendering fidelity and reconstruction accuracy while maintaining real-time speed and minimal storage size.

      We leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as a scene representation and propose a novel test-time camera pose refinement (CPR) framework, GS-CPR. This framework enhances the localization accuracy of state-of-the-art absolute pose regression and scene coordinate regression methods. The 3DGS model renders high-quality synthetic images and depth maps to facilitate the establishment of 2D-3D correspondences. GS-CPR obviates the need for training feature extractors or descriptors by operating directly on RGB images, utilizing the 3D foundation model, MASt3R, for precise 2D matching. To improve the robustness of our model in challenging outdoor environments, we incorporate an exposure-adaptive module within the 3DGS framework. Consequently, GS-CPR enables efficient one-shot pose refinement given a single RGB query and a coarse initial pose estimation. Our proposed approach surpasses leading NeRF-based optimization methods in both accuracy and runtime across indoor and outdoor visual localization benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art accuracy on two indoor datasets.

      Urban scene reconstruction is crucial for real-world autonomous driving simulators. Although existing methods have achieved photorealistic reconstruction, they mostly focus on pinhole cameras and neglect fisheye cameras. In fact, how to effectively simulate fisheye cameras in driving scene remains an unsolved problem. In this work, we propose UniGaussian, a novel approach that learns a unified 3D Gaussian representation from multiple camera models for urban scene reconstruction in autonomous driving. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we propose a new differentiable rendering method that distorts 3D Gaussians using a series of affine transformations tailored to fisheye camera models. This addresses the compatibility issue of 3D Gaussian splatting with fisheye cameras, which is hindered by light ray distortion caused by lenses or mirrors. Besides, our method maintains real-time rendering while ensuring differentiability. Second, built on the differentiable rendering method, we design a new framework that learns a unified Gaussian representation from multiple camera models. By applying affine transformations to adapt different camera models and regularizing the shared Gaussians with supervision from different modalities, our framework learns a unified 3D Gaussian representation with input data from multiple sources and achieves holistic driving scene understanding. As a result, our approach models multiple sensors (pinhole and fisheye cameras) and modalities (depth, semantic, normal and LiDAR point clouds). Our experiments show that our method achieves superior rendering quality and fast rendering speed for driving scene simulation.

      With the advancement of AIGC technologies, the modalities generated by models have expanded from images and videos to 3D objects, leading to an increasing number of works focused on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) generative models. Existing research on copyright protection for generative models has primarily concentrated on watermarking in image and text modalities, with little exploration into the copyright protection of 3D object generative models. In this paper, we propose the first bit watermarking framework for 3DGS generative models, named GaussianSeal, to enable the decoding of bits as copyright identifiers from the rendered outputs of generated 3DGS. By incorporating adaptive bit modulation modules into the generative model and embedding them into the network blocks in an adaptive way, we achieve high-precision bit decoding with minimal training overhead while maintaining the fidelity of the model's outputs. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms post-processing watermarking approaches for 3DGS objects, achieving superior performance of watermark decoding accuracy and preserving the quality of the generated results.

      Simulating object dynamics from real-world perception shows great promise for digital twins and robotic manipulation but often demands labor-intensive measurements and expertise. We present a fully automated Real2Sim pipeline that generates simulation-ready assets for real-world objects through robotic interaction. Using only a robot's joint torque sensors and an external camera, the pipeline identifies visual geometry, collision geometry, and physical properties such as inertial parameters. Our approach introduces a general method for extracting high-quality, object-centric meshes from photometric reconstruction techniques (e.g., NeRF, Gaussian Splatting) by employing alpha-transparent training while explicitly distinguishing foreground occlusions from background subtraction. We validate the full pipeline through extensive experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse objects. By eliminating the need for manual intervention or environment modifications, our pipeline can be integrated directly into existing pick-and-place setups, enabling scalable and efficient dataset creation.

      3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a promising 3D representation. Much research has been focused on reducing its storage requirements and memory footprint. However, the needs to compress and transmit the 3DGS representation to the remote side are overlooked. This new application calls for rate-distortion-optimized 3DGS compression. How to quantize and entropy encode sparse Gaussian primitives in the 3D space remains largely unexplored. Few early attempts resort to the hyperprior framework from learned image compression. But, they fail to utilize fully the inter and intra correlation inherent in Gaussian primitives. Built on ScaffoldGS, this work, termed CAT-3DGS, introduces a context-adaptive triplane approach to their rate-distortion-optimized coding. It features multi-scale triplanes, oriented according to the principal axes of Gaussian primitives in the 3D space, to capture their inter correlation (i.e. spatial correlation) for spatial autoregressive coding in the projected 2D planes. With these triplanes serving as the hyperprior, we further perform channel-wise autoregressive coding to leverage the intra correlation within each individual Gaussian primitive. Our CAT-3DGS incorporates a view frequency-aware masking mechanism. It actively skips from coding those Gaussian primitives that potentially have little impact on the rendering quality. When trained end-to-end to strike a good rate-distortion trade-off, our CAT-3DGS achieves the state-of-the-art compression performance on the commonly used real-world datasets.

      We present a snapshot imaging technique for recovering 3D surrounding views of miniature scenes. Due to their intricacy, miniature scenes with objects sized in millimeters are difficult to reconstruct, yet miniatures are common in life and their 3D digitalization is desirable. We design a catadioptric imaging system with a single camera and eight pairs of planar mirrors for snapshot 3D reconstruction from a dollhouse perspective. We place paired mirrors on nested pyramid surfaces for capturing surrounding multi-view images in a single shot. Our mirror design is customizable based on the size of the scene for optimized view coverage. We use the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation for scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. We overcome the challenge posed by our sparse view input by integrating visual hull-derived depth constraint. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on a variety of synthetic and real miniature scenes.
