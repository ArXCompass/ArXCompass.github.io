      In this work, we propose a novel clothed human reconstruction method called GaussianBody, based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. Compared with the costly neural radiance based models, 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently demonstrated great performance in terms of training time and rendering quality. However, applying the static 3D Gaussian Splatting model to the dynamic human reconstruction problem is non-trivial due to complicated non-rigid deformations and rich cloth details. To address these challenges, our method considers explicit pose-guided deformation to associate dynamic Gaussians across the canonical space and the observation space, introducing a physically-based prior with regularized transformations helps mitigate ambiguity between the two spaces. During the training process, we further propose a pose refinement strategy to update the pose regression for compensating the inaccurate initial estimation and a split-with-scale mechanism to enhance the density of regressed point clouds. The experiments validate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art photorealistic novel-view rendering results with high-quality details for dynamic clothed human bodies, along with explicit geometry reconstruction.

      The accurate 3D reconstruction of deformable soft body tissues from endoscopic videos is a pivotal challenge in medical applications such as VR surgery and medical image analysis. Existing methods often struggle with accuracy and the ambiguity of hallucinated tissue parts, limiting their practical utility. In this work, we introduce EndoGaussians, a novel approach that employs Gaussian Splatting for dynamic endoscopic 3D reconstruction. This method marks the first use of Gaussian Splatting in this context, overcoming the limitations of previous NeRF-based techniques. Our method sets new state-of-the-art standards, as demonstrated by quantitative assessments on various endoscope datasets. These advancements make our method a promising tool for medical professionals, offering more reliable and efficient 3D reconstructions for practical applications in the medical field.

    <details class="paper-abstract">
      Recently, high-fidelity scene reconstruction with an optimized 3D Gaussian splat representation has been introduced for novel view synthesis from sparse image sets. Making such representations suitable for applications like network streaming and rendering on low-power devices requires significantly reduced memory consumption as well as improved rendering efficiency. We propose a compressed 3D Gaussian splat representation that utilizes sensitivity-aware vector clustering with quantization-aware training to compress directional colors and Gaussian parameters. The learned codebooks have low bitrates and achieve a compression rate of up to $31\times$ on real-world scenes with only minimal degradation of visual quality. We demonstrate that the compressed splat representation can be efficiently rendered with hardware rasterization on lightweight GPUs at up to $4\times$ higher framerates than reported via an optimized GPU compute pipeline. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate the robustness and rendering speed of the proposed approach.

      The rise of large foundation models, trained on extensive datasets, is revolutionizing the field of AI. Models such as SAM, DALL-E2, and GPT-4 showcase their adaptability by extracting intricate patterns and performing effectively across diverse tasks, thereby serving as potent building blocks for a wide range of AI applications. Autonomous driving, a vibrant front in AI applications, remains challenged by the lack of dedicated vision foundation models (VFMs). The scarcity of comprehensive training data, the need for multi-sensor integration, and the diverse task-specific architectures pose significant obstacles to the development of VFMs in this field. This paper delves into the critical challenge of forging VFMs tailored specifically for autonomous driving, while also outlining future directions. Through a systematic analysis of over 250 papers, we dissect essential techniques for VFM development, including data preparation, pre-training strategies, and downstream task adaptation. Moreover, we explore key advancements such as NeRF, diffusion models, 3D Gaussian Splatting, and world models, presenting a comprehensive roadmap for future research. To empower researchers, we have built and maintained https://github.com/zhanghm1995/Forge_VFM4AD, an open-access repository constantly updated with the latest advancements in forging VFMs for autonomous driving.

      Neural character models can now reconstruct detailed geometry and texture from video, but they lack explicit shadows and shading, leading to artifacts when generating novel views and poses or during relighting. It is particularly difficult to include shadows as they are a global effect and the required casting of secondary rays is costly. We propose a new shadow model using a Gaussian density proxy that replaces sampling with a simple analytic formula. It supports dynamic motion and is tailored for shadow computation, thereby avoiding the affine projection approximation and sorting required by the closely related Gaussian splatting. Combined with a deferred neural rendering model, our Gaussian shadows enable Lambertian shading and shadow casting with minimal overhead. We demonstrate improved reconstructions, with better separation of albedo, shading, and shadows in challenging outdoor scenes with direct sun light and hard shadows. Our method is able to optimize the light direction without any input from the user. As a result, novel poses have fewer shadow artifacts and relighting in novel scenes is more realistic compared to the state-of-the-art methods, providing new ways to pose neural characters in novel environments, increasing their applicability.

      Given the growing need for automatic 3D content creation pipelines, various 3D representations have been studied to generate 3D objects from a single image. Due to its superior rendering efficiency, 3D Gaussian splatting-based models have recently excelled in both 3D reconstruction and generation. 3D Gaussian splatting approaches for image to 3D generation are often optimization-based, requiring many computationally expensive score-distillation steps. To overcome these challenges, we introduce an Amortized Generative 3D Gaussian framework (AGG) that instantly produces 3D Gaussians from a single image, eliminating the need for per-instance optimization. Utilizing an intermediate hybrid representation, AGG decomposes the generation of 3D Gaussian locations and other appearance attributes for joint optimization. Moreover, we propose a cascaded pipeline that first generates a coarse representation of the 3D data and later upsamples it with a 3D Gaussian super-resolution module. Our method is evaluated against existing optimization-based 3D Gaussian frameworks and sampling-based pipelines utilizing other 3D representations, where AGG showcases competitive generation abilities both qualitatively and quantitatively while being several orders of magnitude faster.

      While AI-generated text and 2D images continue to expand its territory, 3D generation has gradually emerged as a trend that cannot be ignored. Since the year 2023 an abundant amount of research papers has emerged in the domain of 3D generation. This growth encompasses not just the creation of 3D objects, but also the rapid development of 3D character and motion generation. Several key factors contribute to this progress. The enhanced fidelity in stable diffusion, coupled with control methods that ensure multi-view consistency, and realistic human models like SMPL-X, contribute synergistically to the production of 3D models with remarkable consistency and near-realistic appearances. The advancements in neural network-based 3D storing and rendering models, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have accelerated the efficiency and realism of neural rendered models. Furthermore, the multimodality capabilities of large language models have enabled language inputs to transcend into human motion outputs. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview and summary of the relevant papers published mostly during the latter half year of 2023. It will begin by discussing the AI generated object models in 3D, followed by the generated 3D human models, and finally, the generated 3D human motions, culminating in a conclusive summary and a vision for the future.

      The accelerating deployment of spacecraft in orbit have generated interest in on-orbit servicing (OOS), inspection of spacecraft, and active debris removal (ADR). Such missions require precise rendezvous and proximity operations in the vicinity of non-cooperative, possible unknown, resident space objects. Safety concerns with manned missions and lag times with ground-based control necessitate complete autonomy. This requires robust characterization of the target's geometry. In this article, we present an approach for mapping geometries of satellites on orbit based on 3D Gaussian Splatting that can run on computing resources available on current spaceflight hardware. We demonstrate model training and 3D rendering performance on a hardware-in-the-loop satellite mock-up under several realistic lighting and motion conditions. Our model is shown to be capable of training on-board and rendering higher quality novel views of an unknown satellite nearly 2 orders of magnitude faster than previous NeRF-based algorithms. Such on-board capabilities are critical to enable downstream machine intelligence tasks necessary for autonomous guidance, navigation, and control tasks.

      In this paper, we present a method to optimize Gaussian splatting with a limited number of images while avoiding overfitting. Representing a 3D scene by combining numerous Gaussian splats has yielded outstanding visual quality. However, it tends to overfit the training views when only a small number of images are available. To address this issue, we introduce a dense depth map as a geometry guide to mitigate overfitting. We obtained the depth map using a pre-trained monocular depth estimation model and aligning the scale and offset using sparse COLMAP feature points. The adjusted depth aids in the color-based optimization of 3D Gaussian splatting, mitigating floating artifacts, and ensuring adherence to geometric constraints. We verify the proposed method on the NeRF-LLFF dataset with varying numbers of few images. Our approach demonstrates robust geometry compared to the original method that relies solely on images.

      Text-guided diffusion models have revolutionized image and video generation and have also been successfully used for optimization-based 3D object synthesis. Here, we instead focus on the underexplored text-to-4D setting and synthesize dynamic, animated 3D objects using score distillation methods with an additional temporal dimension. Compared to previous work, we pursue a novel compositional generation-based approach, and combine text-to-image, text-to-video, and 3D-aware multiview diffusion models to provide feedback during 4D object optimization, thereby simultaneously enforcing temporal consistency, high-quality visual appearance and realistic geometry. Our method, called Align Your Gaussians (AYG), leverages dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting with deformation fields as 4D representation. Crucial to AYG is a novel method to regularize the distribution of the moving 3D Gaussians and thereby stabilize the optimization and induce motion. We also propose a motion amplification mechanism as well as a new autoregressive synthesis scheme to generate and combine multiple 4D sequences for longer generation. These techniques allow us to synthesize vivid dynamic scenes, outperform previous work qualitatively and quantitatively and achieve state-of-the-art text-to-4D performance. Due to the Gaussian 4D representation, different 4D animations can be seamlessly combined, as we demonstrate. AYG opens up promising avenues for animation, simulation and digital content creation as well as synthetic data generation.
