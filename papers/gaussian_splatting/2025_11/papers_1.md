      In this paper, we present SonarSplat, a novel Gaussian splatting framework for imaging sonar that demonstrates realistic novel view synthesis and models acoustic streaking phenomena. Our method represents the scene as a set of 3D Gaussians with acoustic reflectance and saturation properties. We develop a novel method to efficiently rasterize Gaussians to produce a range/azimuth image that is faithful to the acoustic image formation model of imaging sonar. In particular, we develop a novel approach to model azimuth streaking in a Gaussian splatting framework. We evaluate SonarSplat using real-world datasets of sonar images collected from an underwater robotic platform in a controlled test tank and in a real-world river environment. Compared to the state-of-the-art, SonarSplat offers improved image synthesis capabilities (+3.2 dB PSNR) and more accurate 3D reconstruction (77% lower Chamfer Distance). We also demonstrate that SonarSplat can be leveraged for azimuth streak removal.

      Scene reconstruction has emerged as a central challenge in computer vision, with approaches such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting achieving remarkable progress. While Gaussian Splatting demonstrates strong performance on large-scale datasets, it often struggles to capture fine details or maintain realism in regions with sparse coverage, largely due to the inherent limitations of sparse 3D training data. In this work, we propose GauSSmart, a hybrid method that effectively bridges 2D foundational models and 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction. Our approach integrates established 2D computer vision techniques, including convex filtering and semantic feature supervision from foundational models such as DINO, to enhance Gaussian-based scene reconstruction. By leveraging 2D segmentation priors and high-dimensional feature embeddings, our method guides the densification and refinement of Gaussian splats, improving coverage in underrepresented areas and preserving intricate structural details. We validate our approach across three datasets, where GauSSmart consistently outperforms existing Gaussian Splatting in the majority of evaluated scenes. Our results demonstrate the significant potential of hybrid 2D-3D approaches, highlighting how the thoughtful combination of 2D foundational models with 3D reconstruction pipelines can overcome the limitations inherent in either approach alone.

      In underwater images, most useful features are occluded by water. The extent of the occlusion depends on imaging geometry and can vary even across a sequence of burst images. As a result, 3D reconstruction methods robust on in-air scenes, like Neural Radiance Field methods (NeRFs) or 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), fail on underwater scenes. While a recent underwater adaptation of NeRFs achieved state-of-the-art results, it is impractically slow: reconstruction takes hours and its rendering rate, in frames per second (FPS), is less than 1. Here, we present a new method that takes only a few minutes for reconstruction and renders novel underwater scenes at 140 FPS. Named Gaussian Splashing, our method unifies the strengths and speed of 3DGS with an image formation model for capturing scattering, introducing innovations in the rendering and depth estimation procedures and in the 3DGS loss function. Despite the complexities of underwater adaptation, our method produces images at unparalleled speeds with superior details. Moreover, it reveals distant scene details with far greater clarity than other methods, dramatically improving reconstructed and rendered images. We demonstrate results on existing datasets and a new dataset we have collected. Additional visual results are available at: https://bgu-cs-vil.github.io/gaussiansplashingUW.github.io/ .

      Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has shown great potential for urban scene reconstruction in the field of autonomous driving. However, current urban scene reconstruction methods often depend on multimodal sensors as inputs, \textit{i.e.} LiDAR and images. Though the geometry prior provided by LiDAR point clouds can largely mitigate ill-posedness in reconstruction, acquiring such accurate LiDAR data is still challenging in practice: i) precise spatiotemporal calibration between LiDAR and other sensors is required, as they may not capture data simultaneously; ii) reprojection errors arise from spatial misalignment when LiDAR and cameras are mounted at different locations. To avoid the difficulty of acquiring accurate LiDAR depth, we propose D$^2$GS, a LiDAR-free urban scene reconstruction framework. In this work, we obtain geometry priors that are as effective as LiDAR while being denser and more accurate. $\textbf{First}$, we initialize a dense point cloud by back-projecting multi-view metric depth predictions. This point cloud is then optimized by a Progressive Pruning strategy to improve the global consistency. $\textbf{Second}$, we jointly refine Gaussian geometry and predicted dense metric depth via a Depth Enhancer. Specifically, we leverage diffusion priors from a depth foundation model to enhance the depth maps rendered by Gaussians. In turn, the enhanced depths provide stronger geometric constraints during Gaussian training. $\textbf{Finally}$, we improve the accuracy of ground geometry by constraining the shape and normal attributes of Gaussians within road regions. Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing more accurate geometry even when compared with those using ground-truth LiDAR data.

      2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) has recently emerged as a promising method for novel view synthesis and surface reconstruction, offering better view-consistency and geometric accuracy than volumetric 3DGS. However, 2DGS suffers from severe aliasing artifacts when rendering at different sampling rates than those used during training, limiting its practical applications in scenarios requiring camera zoom or varying fields of view. We identify that these artifacts stem from two key limitations: the lack of frequency constraints in the representation and an ineffective screen-space clamping approach. To address these issues, we present AA-2DGS, an anti-aliased formulation of 2D Gaussian Splatting that maintains its geometric benefits while significantly enhancing rendering quality across different scales. Our method introduces a world-space flat smoothing kernel that constrains the frequency content of 2D Gaussian primitives based on the maximal sampling frequency from training views, effectively eliminating high-frequency artifacts when zooming in. Additionally, we derive a novel object-space Mip filter by leveraging an affine approximation of the ray-splat intersection mapping, which allows us to efficiently apply proper anti-aliasing directly in the local space of each splat.
